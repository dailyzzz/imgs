Top panel shows happy African American couple smiling intimately with text 'THIS COULD BE US'. Middle and bottom panels show person in purple jacket kicked through chain-link fence onto grass with text 'BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN FLAT EARTH' and 'SO GET THE HECK OUT!' Watermark shows 'Nick Havok'. Humorous exaggerated portrayal of flat Earth believer rejecting romantic partner over cosmological disagreement. Violent imagery played for comedy suggesting flat Earth belief is relationship deal-breaker. Format parodies romantic 'could be us' memes"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-41","title":"Funny 41","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/a20e00812949af796c96944ade6cd88c.png","description":"Gray cat at laptop meme showing Scottish Fold or similar breed cat with distinctive rounded ears sitting at computer on beige carpeted floor.

Retro aesthetic combined with Twilight Zone-style introduction presenting spherical Earth concept as absurd science fiction premise. Man's skeptical expression emphasizes incredulity at mainstream cosmology. Suggests spinning globe with people clinging to all sides is too fantastical to believe, framing heliocentric model as bizarre fiction"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
