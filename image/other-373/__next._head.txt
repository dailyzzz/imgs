5:T29c6,Neil deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos. Humorous meme format using police booking photo aesthetic to mock astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for scientifically accurate statement about Earth's actual shape. Image presents Tyson as "criminal" whose crime was saying truth that flat Earthers interpret as contradiction proving conspiracy. Format mimics standard police booking photographs taken during arrest processing. Background shows height measurement wall - gray horizontal lines with height markings in feet and inches visible on left side (10', 8', 6' markers visible). Creates authentic police lineup/mugshot aesthetic suggesting Tyson being arrested or processed. Subject is Neil deGrasse Tyson shown in two standard booking photo angles: LEFT SIDE shows frontal view - Tyson facing camera directly with neutral expression typical of booking photos. Face clearly recognizable - dark skin, short dark curly hair, mustache, wide-set eyes looking directly at camera with slight concern or seriousness. Wearing dark V-neck shirt or sweater showing chest hair. Shoulders squared to camera. Expression shows no emotion, following standard booking photo protocol where subjects told to maintain neutral face. RIGHT SIDE shows profile view - Tyson's head turned 90 degrees showing right side profile. Same neutral expression, mustache visible in profile, ear visible, short hair showing texture. Profile angle reveals facial structure, nose shape, jawline. Both photos appear same session with identical clothing, lighting, background. Photo quality appears grainy/low resolution typical of older institutional photography or intentionally degraded to appear more authentic to mugshot aesthetic. Black and white or desaturated color scheme enhances vintage booking photo feel. Bottom of image shows name plate typical of booking photos: White text on black background reading "NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON" in all caps, with partial number visible "12122" suggesting booking or case number. Name plate positioning matches authentic police photo format where identification information displayed below subject. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for contrast and readability. Top text reads: "SAID THE EARTH IS PEAR SHAPED" in all caps describing Tyson's "crime" - stating scientific fact about Earth's actual shape. Bottom text reads: "FORGOT ABOUT 50 YEARS OF FAKE NASA PHOTOS" in all caps suggesting Tyson's error was contradicting supposed consistency of faked NASA imagery by revealing Earth isn't perfect sphere. Center of image shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in gray text. Meme's argument operates on several misconceptions: 1) PEAR-SHAPED EARTH STATEMENT: Neil deGrasse Tyson has accurately stated Earth is not perfect sphere but oblate spheroid - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation. More precisely, Earth is very slightly pear-shaped with southern hemisphere marginally larger than northern hemisphere by tiny amount (difference of ~30 feet in 8,000 mile diameter - 0.0004% variation). This is measurable scientific fact confirmed by satellite geodesy, gravitational measurements, precise surveying. Tyson's statement reflects current scientific understanding of Earth's actual shape. 2) PERCEIVED CONTRADICTION: Flat Earthers interpret "pear-shaped" statement as contradiction of NASA photos showing Earth as sphere. Argument suggests: If Earth truly spherical as NASA photos show for 50+ years, why does Tyson now say it's pear-shaped? Must be lying about something - either old photos are fake (showing perfect sphere when Earth is actually pear) or Tyson is wrong now. Flat Earthers choose interpretation that old photos are fake, proving NASA has been lying for decades. 3) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Earth's pear-shape variation is so minuscule it's imperceptible in photographs. At 0.0004% variation, difference between perfect sphere and Earth's actual shape is invisible to human eye at planetary scale. Like describing perfectly round basketball that's 0.0004% asymmetrical - you'd never notice unless measuring with precision instruments. NASA photos correctly show Earth appearing spherical because at photographic resolution, the tiny pear-shaped variation is far below visible threshold. Photos are accurate representations of what Earth looks like - spherical with imperceptible asymmetry. 4) SCIENTIFIC PRECISION VS VISUAL APPEARANCE: Science requires precision beyond visual observation. Saying Earth is spherical is correct for general purposes - planet is round, not flat. Saying Earth is oblate spheroid is more precise - round but slightly flattened. Saying Earth is pear-shaped oblate spheroid is even more precise - accounts for southern hemisphere's tiny extra bulge. Each statement is true at different precision levels. Analogous to describing someone's height: "about 6 feet" vs "6 feet 1/4 inch" vs "6 feet 0.237 inches" - all correct, increasing precision. Visual photos show "round" which is accurate at visible scale. Precise measurements show "pear-shaped" which is accurate at measurement precision. No contradiction. 5) "FAKE NASA PHOTOS" CLAIM: Meme suggests NASA photos are fabricated because they don't show pear shape. But photos DO show Earth's actual shape accurately - at photographic resolution, Earth appears spherical because pear-shaped variation is submicroscopic relative to planet size. If NASA were faking photos, they wouldn't bother making them show perfect sphere - they'd include accurate oblate spheroid shape and tiny pear asymmetry in renderings to match known measurements. Fact that photos show apparently perfect sphere actually confirms they're real photographs, not CGI optimized to match measurements. Real photographs show what human eyes would see - round planet. CGI would show mathematically perfect shape including all measured asymmetries. MUGSHOT FORMAT creates humorous suggestion that stating scientific truth is criminal offense. Implies Tyson "caught" in contradiction, being arrested for exposing NASA lies. But mugshot is photoshopped composite - Tyson never actually arrested, images are edited to create booking photo appearance. Format serves to mock and discredit Tyson rather than engage with scientific accuracy of his statements. Neil deGrasse Tyson frequently targeted by flat Earth movement because: As prominent science communicator and astrophysicist, he represents mainstream scientific establishment that flat Earthers oppose. His media presence (hosted Cosmos reboot, frequent TV appearances, social media following) makes him highly visible advocate for scientific consensus. His confident, sometimes condescending communication style can be polarizing, making him target for ridicule. He's defended spherical Earth, space exploration, NASA against conspiracy theories, making him enemy of flat Earth movement. His statements about Earth's precise shape give flat Earthers perceived ammunition for "gotcha" contradictions. Historical context of Earth's shape understanding: Ancient Greeks knew Earth was spherical (Eratosthenes measured circumference 240 BCE using shadows). Newton predicted oblate spheroid shape due to rotation (1687). Precise measurements confirmed oblate spheroid with polar flattening (equatorial diameter ~27 miles larger than polar diameter). Modern satellite geodesy revealed tiny pear-shaped asymmetry (southern hemisphere slightly larger than northern by ~30 feet). Each advance in precision refined understanding without contradicting previous knowledge - Earth is round, more precisely oblate spheroid, even more precisely pear-shaped oblate spheroid. All statements correct at respective precision levels. Photos from space confirmed visual appearance matches scientific models. Meme's "50 years of fake NASA photos" references period from 1960s (early space age) to present. Suggests consistent imagery over decades is evidence of fabrication rather than evidence of authenticity. But consistency over 50+ years across multiple nations, agencies, private companies, with geography matching ground-based maps, weather patterns matching meteorological data, and visible features consistent over time actually proves authenticity. Maintaining fake consistency would be far harder than taking real photos. Joke in meme works through false dichotomy: Either NASA photos show perfect sphere (and are therefore fake because Earth is actually pear-shaped), or Tyson is wrong about pear shape. Ignores third option that both are correct - Earth appears spherical in photos because pear asymmetry is imperceptible at visible scale, while precise measurements reveal tiny pear shape invisible in photographs. Format also contains irony: Using criminal mugshot to mock scientist for stating accurate scientific fact reflects anti-intellectual strain in conspiracy movements where education and expertise seen as crimes rather than virtues. Scientist "arrested" for truth-telling inverts reality where conspiracy theorists see themselves as truth-tellers persecuted by establishment. Tyson becomes avatar for scientific establishment that flat Earthers believe is lying. Effectiveness comes from: Accessible format (mugshot is universally recognized), humor (absurdity of arresting scientist for scientific statement), perceived contradiction (pear vs sphere), and confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust NASA see this as evidence of lies). Weakness: Anyone understanding scale and precision recognizes no contradiction exists. Pear-shaped variation of 0.0004% is invisible in photos, so photos accurately show apparent sphere while measurements reveal imperceptible asymmetry. Both Tyson's statement and NASA photos are correct. Meme also serves flat Earth community function: Provides quick dismissal of Tyson's credibility. When Tyson cited as authority on Earth's shape, flat Earthers can reference this meme - "he said pear-shaped contradicting NASA, so he's unreliable" - without engaging with actual science. Creates perception of inconsistency in scientific community when no real inconsistency exists. Bottom line: Meme misrepresents both Tyson's statement (which is scientifically accurate) and NASA photos (which are authentic representations of Earth's appearance). Creates false contradiction by conflating visible appearance with measured asymmetry at sub-visual precision level. Uses humor and mugshot format to discredit science communicator rather than examining evidence. Assumes audience won't understand scale of asymmetry (0.0004%) or relationship between photographic representation and measurement precision.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 373 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Neil deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos.
