Humorous meme format using police booking photo aesthetic to mock astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for scientifically accurate statement about Earth&#x27;s actual shape. Image presents Tyson as &quot;criminal&quot; whose crime was saying truth that flat Earthers interpret as contradiction proving conspiracy. Format mimics standard police booking photographs taken during arrest processing. Background shows height measurement wall - gray horizontal lines with height markings in feet and inches visible on left side (10&#x27;, 8&#x27;, 6&#x27; markers visible). Creates authentic police lineup/mugshot aesthetic suggesting Tyson being arrested or processed. Subject is Neil deGrasse Tyson shown in two standard booking photo angles: LEFT SIDE shows frontal view - Tyson facing camera directly with neutral expression typical of booking photos. Face clearly recognizable - dark skin, short dark curly hair, mustache, wide-set eyes looking directly at camera with slight concern or seriousness. Wearing dark V-neck shirt or sweater showing chest hair. Shoulders squared to camera. Expression shows no emotion, following standard booking photo protocol where subjects told to maintain neutral face. RIGHT SIDE shows profile view - Tyson&#x27;s head turned 90 degrees showing right side profile. Same neutral expression, mustache visible in profile, ear visible, short hair showing texture. Profile angle reveals facial structure, nose shape, jawline. Both photos appear same session with identical clothing, lighting, background. Photo quality appears grainy/low resolution typical of older institutional photography or intentionally degraded to appear more authentic to mugshot aesthetic. Black and white or desaturated color scheme enhances vintage booking photo feel. Bottom of image shows name plate typical of booking photos: White text on black background reading &quot;NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON&quot; in all caps, with partial number visible &quot;12122&quot; suggesting booking or case number. Name plate positioning matches authentic police photo format where identification information displayed below subject. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for contrast and readability. Top text reads: &quot;SAID THE EARTH IS PEAR SHAPED&quot; in all caps describing Tyson&#x27;s &quot;crime&quot; - stating scientific fact about Earth&#x27;s actual shape. Bottom text reads: &quot;FORGOT ABOUT 50 YEARS OF FAKE NASA PHOTOS&quot; in all caps suggesting Tyson&#x27;s error was contradicting supposed consistency of faked NASA imagery by revealing Earth isn&#x27;t perfect sphere. Center of image shows &quot;fb.com/fematters&quot; attribution in gray text. Meme&#x27;s argument operates on several misconceptions: 1) PEAR-SHAPED EARTH STATEMENT: Neil deGrasse Tyson has accurately stated Earth is not perfect sphere but oblate spheroid - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation. More precisely, Earth is very slightly pear-shaped with southern hemisphere marginally larger than northern hemisphere by tiny amount (difference of ~30 feet in 8,000 mile diameter - 0.0004% variation). This is measurable scientific fact confirmed by satellite geodesy, gravitational measurements, precise surveying. Tyson&#x27;s statement reflects current scientific understanding of Earth&#x27;s actual shape. 2) PERCEIVED CONTRADICTION: Flat Earthers interpret &quot;pear-shaped&quot; statement as contradiction of NASA photos showing Earth as sphere. Argument suggests: If Earth truly spherical as NASA photos show for 50+ years, why does Tyson now say it&#x27;s pear-shaped? Must be lying about something - either old photos are fake (showing perfect sphere when Earth is actually pear) or Tyson is wrong now. Flat Earthers choose interpretation that old photos are fake, proving NASA has been lying for decades. 3) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Earth&#x27;s pear-shape variation is so minuscule it&#x27;s imperceptible in photographs. At 0.0004% variation, difference between perfect sphere and Earth&#x27;s actual shape is invisible to human eye at planetary scale. Like describing perfectly round basketball that&#x27;s 0.0004% asymmetrical - you&#x27;d never notice unless measuring with precision instruments. NASA photos correctly show Earth appearing spherical because at photographic resolution, the tiny pear-shaped variation is far below visible threshold. Photos are accurate representations of what Earth looks like - spherical with imperceptible asymmetry. 4) SCIENTIFIC PRECISION VS VISUAL APPEARANCE: Science requires precision beyond visual observation. Saying Earth is spherical is correct for general purposes - planet is round, not flat. Saying Earth is oblate spheroid is more precise - round but slightly flattened. Saying Earth is pear-shaped oblate spheroid is even more precise - accounts for southern hemisphere&#x27;s tiny extra bulge. Each statement is true at different precision levels. Analogous to describing someone&#x27;s height: &quot;about 6 feet&quot; vs &quot;6 feet 1/4 inch&quot; vs &quot;6 feet 0.237 inches&quot; - all correct, increasing precision. Visual photos show &quot;round&quot; which is accurate at visible scale. Precise measurements show &quot;pear-shaped&quot; which is accurate at measurement precision. No contradiction. 5) &quot;FAKE NASA PHOTOS&quot; CLAIM: Meme suggests NASA photos are fabricated because they don&#x27;t show pear shape. But photos DO show Earth&#x27;s actual shape accurately - at photographic resolution, Earth appears spherical because pear-shaped variation is submicroscopic relative to planet size. If NASA were faking photos, they wouldn&#x27;t bother making them show perfect sphere - they&#x27;d include accurate oblate spheroid shape and tiny pear asymmetry in renderings to match known measurements. Fact that photos show apparently perfect sphere actually confirms they&#x27;re real photographs, not CGI optimized to match measurements. Real photographs show what human eyes would see - round planet. CGI would show mathematically perfect shape including all measured asymmetries. MUGSHOT FORMAT creates humorous suggestion that stating scientific truth is criminal offense. Implies Tyson &quot;caught&quot; in contradiction, being arrested for exposing NASA lies. But mugshot is photoshopped composite - Tyson never actually arrested, images are edited to create booking photo appearance. Format serves to mock and discredit Tyson rather than engage with scientific accuracy of his statements. Neil deGrasse Tyson frequently targeted by flat Earth movement because: As prominent science communicator and astrophysicist, he represents mainstream scientific establishment that flat Earthers oppose. His media presence (hosted Cosmos reboot, frequent TV appearances, social media following) makes him highly visible advocate for scientific consensus. His confident, sometimes condescending communication style can be polarizing, making him target for ridicule. He&#x27;s defended spherical Earth, space exploration, NASA against conspiracy theories, making him enemy of flat Earth movement. His statements about Earth&#x27;s precise shape give flat Earthers perceived ammunition for &quot;gotcha&quot; contradictions. Historical context of Earth&#x27;s shape understanding: Ancient Greeks knew Earth was spherical (Eratosthenes measured circumference 240 BCE using shadows). Newton predicted oblate spheroid shape due to rotation (1687). Precise measurements confirmed oblate spheroid with polar flattening (equatorial diameter ~27 miles larger than polar diameter). Modern satellite geodesy revealed tiny pear-shaped asymmetry (southern hemisphere slightly larger than northern by ~30 feet). Each advance in precision refined understanding without contradicting previous knowledge - Earth is round, more precisely oblate spheroid, even more precisely pear-shaped oblate spheroid. All statements correct at respective precision levels. Photos from space confirmed visual appearance matches scientific models. Meme&#x27;s &quot;50 years of fake NASA photos&quot; references period from 1960s (early space age) to present. Suggests consistent imagery over decades is evidence of fabrication rather than evidence of authenticity. But consistency over 50+ years across multiple nations, agencies, private companies, with geography matching ground-based maps, weather patterns matching meteorological data, and visible features consistent over time actually proves authenticity. Maintaining fake consistency would be far harder than taking real photos. Joke in meme works through false dichotomy: Either NASA photos show perfect sphere (and are therefore fake because Earth is actually pear-shaped), or Tyson is wrong about pear shape. Ignores third option that both are correct - Earth appears spherical in photos because pear asymmetry is imperceptible at visible scale, while precise measurements reveal tiny pear shape invisible in photographs. Format also contains irony: Using criminal mugshot to mock scientist for stating accurate scientific fact reflects anti-intellectual strain in conspiracy movements where education and expertise seen as crimes rather than virtues. Scientist &quot;arrested&quot; for truth-telling inverts reality where conspiracy theorists see themselves as truth-tellers persecuted by establishment. Tyson becomes avatar for scientific establishment that flat Earthers believe is lying. Effectiveness comes from: Accessible format (mugshot is universally recognized), humor (absurdity of arresting scientist for scientific statement), perceived contradiction (pear vs sphere), and confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust NASA see this as evidence of lies). Weakness: Anyone understanding scale and precision recognizes no contradiction exists. Pear-shaped variation of 0.0004% is invisible in photos, so photos accurately show apparent sphere while measurements reveal imperceptible asymmetry. Both Tyson&#x27;s statement and NASA photos are correct. Meme also serves flat Earth community function: Provides quick dismissal of Tyson&#x27;s credibility. When Tyson cited as authority on Earth&#x27;s shape, flat Earthers can reference this meme - &quot;he said pear-shaped contradicting NASA, so he&#x27;s unreliable&quot; - without engaging with actual science. Creates perception of inconsistency in scientific community when no real inconsistency exists. Bottom line: Meme misrepresents both Tyson&#x27;s statement (which is scientifically accurate) and NASA photos (which are authentic representations of Earth&#x27;s appearance). Creates false contradiction by conflating visible appearance with measured asymmetry at sub-visual precision level. Uses humor and mugshot format to discredit science communicator rather than examining evidence. Assumes audience won&#x27;t understand scale of asymmetry (0.0004%) or relationship between photographic representation and measurement precision."/><meta property="og:type" content="article"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Other 373"/><meta name="twitter:description" content="Neil deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos.

deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos. Humorous meme format using police booking photo aesthetic to mock astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for scientifically accurate statement about Earth's actual shape. Image presents Tyson as \"criminal\" whose crime was saying truth that flat Earthers interpret as contradiction proving conspiracy. Format mimics standard police booking photographs taken during arrest processing. Background shows height measurement wall - gray horizontal lines with height markings in feet and inches visible on left side (10', 8', 6' markers visible). Creates authentic police lineup/mugshot aesthetic suggesting Tyson being arrested or processed. Subject is Neil deGrasse Tyson shown in two standard booking photo angles: LEFT SIDE shows frontal view - Tyson facing camera directly with neutral expression typical of booking photos. Face clearly recognizable - dark skin, short dark curly hair, mustache, wide-set eyes looking directly at camera with slight concern or seriousness. Wearing dark V-neck shirt or sweater showing chest hair. Shoulders squared to camera. Expression shows no emotion, following standard booking photo protocol where subjects told to maintain neutral face. RIGHT SIDE shows profile view - Tyson's head turned 90 degrees showing right side profile. Same neutral expression, mustache visible in profile, ear visible, short hair showing texture. Profile angle reveals facial structure, nose shape, jawline. Both photos appear same session with identical clothing, lighting, background. Photo quality appears grainy/low resolution typical of older institutional photography or intentionally degraded to appear more authentic to mugshot aesthetic. Black and white or desaturated color scheme enhances vintage booking photo feel. Bottom of image shows name plate typical of booking photos: White text on black background reading \"NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON\" in all caps, with partial number visible \"12122\" suggesting booking or case number. Name plate positioning matches authentic police photo format where identification information displayed below subject. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for contrast and readability. Top text reads: \"SAID THE EARTH IS PEAR SHAPED\" in all caps describing Tyson's \"crime\" - stating scientific fact about Earth's actual shape. Bottom text reads: \"FORGOT ABOUT 50 YEARS OF FAKE NASA PHOTOS\" in all caps suggesting Tyson's error was contradicting supposed consistency of faked NASA imagery by revealing Earth isn't perfect sphere. Center of image shows \"fb.com/fematters\" attribution in gray text. Meme's argument operates on several misconceptions: 1) PEAR-SHAPED EARTH STATEMENT: Neil deGrasse Tyson has accurately stated Earth is not perfect sphere but oblate spheroid - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation. More precisely, Earth is very slightly pear-shaped with southern hemisphere marginally larger than northern hemisphere by tiny amount (difference of ~30 feet in 8,000 mile diameter - 0.0004% variation). This is measurable scientific fact confirmed by satellite geodesy, gravitational measurements, precise surveying. Tyson's statement reflects current scientific understanding of Earth's actual shape. 2) PERCEIVED CONTRADICTION: Flat Earthers interpret \"pear-shaped\" statement as contradiction of NASA photos showing Earth as sphere. Argument suggests: If Earth truly spherical as NASA photos show for 50+ years, why does Tyson now say it's pear-shaped? Must be lying about something - either old photos are fake (showing perfect sphere when Earth is actually pear) or Tyson is wrong now. Flat Earthers choose interpretation that old photos are fake, proving NASA has been lying for decades. 3) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Earth's pear-shape variation is so minuscule it's imperceptible in photographs. At 0.0004% variation, difference between perfect sphere and Earth's actual shape is invisible to human eye at planetary scale. Like describing perfectly round basketball that's 0.0004% asymmetrical - you'd never notice unless measuring with precision instruments. NASA photos correctly show Earth appearing spherical because at photographic resolution, the tiny pear-shaped variation is far below visible threshold. Photos are accurate representations of what Earth looks like - spherical with imperceptible asymmetry. 4) SCIENTIFIC PRECISION VS VISUAL APPEARANCE: Science requires precision beyond visual observation. Saying Earth is spherical is correct for general purposes - planet is round, not flat. Saying Earth is oblate spheroid is more precise - round but slightly flattened. Saying Earth is pear-shaped oblate spheroid is even more precise - accounts for southern hemisphere's tiny extra bulge. Each statement is true at different precision levels. Analogous to describing someone's height: \"about 6 feet\" vs \"6 feet 1/4 inch\" vs \"6 feet 0.237 inches\" - all correct, increasing precision. Visual photos show \"round\" which is accurate at visible scale. Precise measurements show \"pear-shaped\" which is accurate at measurement precision. No contradiction. 5) \"FAKE NASA PHOTOS\" CLAIM: Meme suggests NASA photos are fabricated because they don't show pear shape. But photos DO show Earth's actual shape accurately - at photographic resolution, Earth appears spherical because pear-shaped variation is submicroscopic relative to planet size. If NASA were faking photos, they wouldn't bother making them show perfect sphere - they'd include accurate oblate spheroid shape and tiny pear asymmetry in renderings to match known measurements. Fact that photos show apparently perfect sphere actually confirms they're real photographs, not CGI optimized to match measurements. Real photographs show what human eyes would see - round planet. CGI would show mathematically perfect shape including all measured asymmetries. MUGSHOT FORMAT creates humorous suggestion that stating scientific truth is criminal offense. Implies Tyson \"caught\" in contradiction, being arrested for exposing NASA lies. But mugshot is photoshopped composite - Tyson never actually arrested, images are edited to create booking photo appearance. Format serves to mock and discredit Tyson rather than engage with scientific accuracy of his statements. Neil deGrasse Tyson frequently targeted by flat Earth movement because: As prominent science communicator and astrophysicist, he represents mainstream scientific establishment that flat Earthers oppose. His media presence (hosted Cosmos reboot, frequent TV appearances, social media following) makes him highly visible advocate for scientific consensus. His confident, sometimes condescending communication style can be polarizing, making him target for ridicule. He's defended spherical Earth, space exploration, NASA against conspiracy theories, making him enemy of flat Earth movement. His statements about Earth's precise shape give flat Earthers perceived ammunition for \"gotcha\" contradictions. Historical context of Earth's shape understanding: Ancient Greeks knew Earth was spherical (Eratosthenes measured circumference 240 BCE using shadows). Newton predicted oblate spheroid shape due to rotation (1687). Precise measurements confirmed oblate spheroid with polar flattening (equatorial diameter ~27 miles larger than polar diameter). Modern satellite geodesy revealed tiny pear-shaped asymmetry (southern hemisphere slightly larger than northern by ~30 feet). Each advance in precision refined understanding without contradicting previous knowledge - Earth is round, more precisely oblate spheroid, even more precisely pear-shaped oblate spheroid. All statements correct at respective precision levels. Photos from space confirmed visual appearance matches scientific models. Meme's \"50 years of fake NASA photos\" references period from 1960s (early space age) to present. Suggests consistent imagery over decades is evidence of fabrication rather than evidence of authenticity. But consistency over 50+ years across multiple nations, agencies, private companies, with geography matching ground-based maps, weather patterns matching meteorological data, and visible features consistent over time actually proves authenticity. Maintaining fake consistency would be far harder than taking real photos. Joke in meme works through false dichotomy: Either NASA photos show perfect sphere (and are therefore fake because Earth is actually pear-shaped), or Tyson is wrong about pear shape. Ignores third option that both are correct - Earth appears spherical in photos because pear asymmetry is imperceptible at visible scale, while precise measurements reveal tiny pear shape invisible in photographs. Format also contains irony: Using criminal mugshot to mock scientist for stating accurate scientific fact reflects anti-intellectual strain in conspiracy movements where education and expertise seen as crimes rather than virtues. Scientist \"arrested\" for truth-telling inverts reality where conspiracy theorists see themselves as truth-tellers persecuted by establishment. Tyson becomes avatar for scientific establishment that flat Earthers believe is lying. Effectiveness comes from: Accessible format (mugshot is universally recognized), humor (absurdity of arresting scientist for scientific statement), perceived contradiction (pear vs sphere), and confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust NASA see this as evidence of lies). Weakness: Anyone understanding scale and precision recognizes no contradiction exists. Pear-shaped variation of 0.0004% is invisible in photos, so photos accurately show apparent sphere while measurements reveal imperceptible asymmetry. Both Tyson's statement and NASA photos are correct. Meme also serves flat Earth community function: Provides quick dismissal of Tyson's credibility. When Tyson cited as authority on Earth's shape, flat Earthers can reference this meme - \"he said pear-shaped contradicting NASA, so he's unreliable\" - without engaging with actual science. Creates perception of inconsistency in scientific community when no real inconsistency exists. Bottom line: Meme misrepresents both Tyson's statement (which is scientifically accurate) and NASA photos (which are authentic representations of Earth's appearance). Creates false contradiction by conflating visible appearance with measured asymmetry at sub-visual precision level. Uses humor and mugshot format to discredit science communicator rather than examining evidence. Assumes audience won't understand scale of asymmetry (0.0004%) or relationship between photographic representation and measurement precision."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T368e,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Absurdist meme of cowboy riding missile-straddling dinosaur shooting shark with text mocking NASA photo authentication. Surreal photoshopped composite image creating impossible scenario to satirize claims that any NASA photograph must be authentic. Image uses deliberately ridiculous, obviously fake composition to mock argument \"If photo is on NASA website, it must be real.\" Meme operates through reductio ad absurdum - if NASA presence validates any image regardless of content, then even absurd impossible image should be believed if NASA hosted it. Central figure is Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur in brown/green coloration with typical T-Rex features - massive head with enormous jaws full of sharp teeth, tiny forearms, powerful hind legs, thick tail extending behind. Dinosaur appears in aggressive posture with mouth open showing teeth, suggesting attacking or roaring. Dinosaur rendered in semi-realistic style (possibly from documentary or film CGI, or photoshopped from museum skeleton/model). Mounted ON TOP of dinosaur's back is human figure wearing cowboy outfit - appears to be man in Western attire with cowboy hat, possibly jeans/shirt typical of Wild West imagery. Cowboy sits astride T-Rex like riding horse, in action pose suggesting rodeo or cavalry charge. Cowboy holds weapon aimed forward - appears to be rifle or similar firearm. Pose suggests Old West gunfighter or cavalry soldier, transplanted into context of riding dinosaur into battle. Beneath/between dinosaur's legs is SHARK suspended in mid-air - appears to be great white shark based on size, coloration (gray back, white underside), dorsal fin. Shark positioned horizontally in swimming pose but floating impossibly in air beneath dinosaur without water or support. Shark's mouth open showing rows of sharp teeth. Shark scale seems roughly proportional to dinosaur size, creating bizarre menagerie of predators from different eras/environments impossibly combined. Most absurd element: MISSILE or ROCKET positioned between dinosaur and shark. Large military-style missile appears horizontally oriented, gray/silver metal surface with tail fins, pointed nose cone, exhaust trail suggesting propulsion. Missile positioned as if dinosaur is straddling it while rocket fires - imagine rodeo rider on bull, but bull is dinosaur-missile hybrid. Cowboy appears to be RIDING this dinosaur-missile contraption while SHOOTING at shark. Entire composition violates physics, biology, chronology, basic reality. Background appears to be outdoor sky - light blue color with some cloud texture suggesting this scene supposedly occurring in Earth's atmosphere. Ground may be partially visible at bottom suggesting scene near surface. Overall lighting suggests daytime, though shadows inconsistent (common in amateur Photoshop composites). Image quality varies across elements suggesting different source materials composited together - some elements sharp, others blurrier, lighting directions inconsistent, scale relationships questionable. Obviously amateur Photoshop work, intentionally bad composition for comedic effect. Text overlays in white sans-serif font with black outlines for contrast and readability. Top text in large letters reads: \"IT WAS ON THE NASA WEBSITE\" in all caps emphasizing supposed authority of NASA hosting. Bottom text continues: \"SO IT MUST BE REAL\" completing sarcastic argument - if NASA website hosts image, image must be authentic photograph of real event. Lower right shows \"fb.com/fematters\" attribution. Meme satirizes flat Earth community's selective skepticism: 1) MOCKING NASA TRUST: Flat Earthers accuse others of blindly trusting NASA photos of space, Earth from orbit, satellites, astronauts. Argument suggests \"globe believers\" automatically accept any NASA image as real without critical examination. Meme exaggerates this to absurdity - would you believe cowboys rode missiles on dinosaurs hunting sharks in midair just because image appeared on NASA website? Obviously not. Therefore, implies we shouldn't automatically trust NASA's actual space photography either. 2) REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM: Logical technique of taking opponent's principle to extreme conclusion to show principle is flawed. If \"NASA website = proof of authenticity\" were valid principle, then this impossible image would be real if NASA posted it. Since that's ridiculous, principle must be wrong. Therefore, NASA's actual space photos might also be fake despite NASA hosting them. 3) PHOTOSHOP ACCUSATIONS: Flat Earth movement frequently accuses NASA of photoshopping Earth images - claims clouds copied/pasted, composites from multiple photos, size of continents changes between images, colors unrealistic. When NASA explains images are composites (necessarily true for whole-Earth views because satellites orbit and Earth rotates - must stitch together images from different times/angles to create full globe view), flat Earthers cite this as admission of fakery. Meme's obvious photoshop (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) is meant to look like NASA's supposed photoshop of space images. 4) APPEAL TO ABSURDITY: By creating maximally absurd scenario (combining predators from land/sea/extinct eras, adding Western cowboy, throwing in missile for extra impossibility, having shark fly without water), meme generates immediate gut response: \"This is obviously fake!\" Meme then trains that skeptical response onto NASA's legitimate photos: \"See how easily fake images can be made? NASA photos could be just as fake, just less obviously.\" However, meme's logic is flawed: 1) NOBODY CLAIMS NASA HOSTING PROVES AUTHENTICITY: Globe Earth believers don't accept space photos merely because NASA posted them. Photos are accepted because: Multiple space agencies from competing nations (USA/NASA, Russia/Roscosmos, ESA, China/CNSA, India/ISRO, Japan/JAXA, etc.) independently produce similar images of spherical Earth. Private companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Planet Labs, etc.) produce similar images. All consistent with spherical Earth, inconsistent with flat Earth. Images show consistent geography, weather patterns, seasonal changes over decades - impossible to maintain fake consistency across thousands of images from hundreds of missions over 60+ years. Amateur astronomers can photograph satellites in orbit, track ISS, observe objects matching official positions. Photo metadata (EXIF data, spectral analysis, lighting angles) consistent with claimed origins. Physics of optics, orbital mechanics predict exactly what cameras in orbit should see - predictions match photographs. Independent verification from non-governmental sources. Trust isn't blind faith in NASA, but confidence built on multiple independent confirmations. 2) OBVIOUS FAKE VS SOPHISTICATED COMPOSITE: Meme's image is obviously impossible - combines entities that can't coexist (dinosaurs extinct 65 million years ago, sharks need water, missiles didn't exist in dinosaur era, humans came after dinosaurs). Poor photoshop execution (lighting mismatches, scale inconsistencies, unnatural positioning). NASA's images show Earth/space scenes that are physically possible and consistent with physics. Compositing multiple orbital photos into single Earth view is technically necessary and clearly explained, different from fabricating impossible scene. 3) VERIFIABLE VS UNVERIFIABLE: NASA photos can be verified independently through: Launching your own satellite (amateur cubesats do this), high-altitude balloon photography showing curvature, replicating observations (astronauts see Earth rotate, matching rotation rate measured from ground), checking consistency (Earth's geography matches maps derived from ground survey, ship/plane navigation over centuries). Cowboy-dinosaur-shark image can't be verified because scenario never occurred and is physically impossible. 4) STRAWMAN ARGUMENT: Meme attacks argument nobody makes. Scientists/educators don't say \"trust NASA because they're NASA.\" They say \"NASA's findings match independent verification, follow from physics, predict observations, and are replicated by other agencies. Therefore NASA's data is reliable.\" That's evidence-based trust, not blind faith. Meme's effectiveness comes from humor and simplicity: Absurd image is memorable, creates strong emotional response (laughter at absurdity), makes complex issue (how do we verify remote observations?) seem simple (\"obviously this is fake, so maybe NASA stuff is too\"). Humor bypasses analytical thinking. Meme format allows quick sharing of concept without need for lengthy explanation. Image sticks in memory because of bizarre combination. But meme's logic falls apart under examination: Just because some images are fake doesn't mean all images are fake. Just because Photoshop exists doesn't mean every photo is photoshopped. World would be chaos if we couldn't distinguish between obvious composites (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) and legitimate photography (Earth from space). We successfully make these distinctions constantly - nobody files insurance claims showing alien abduction photos as evidence, courts don't accept photoshopped images as proof, journalists verify photos before publication. Sophisticated methods exist for detecting photo manipulation (forensic analysis of compression artifacts, lighting consistency, metadata examination, shadow angle verification). NASA photos pass these tests. Cowboys-on-dinosaurs photo would immediately fail. Irony: Flat Earthers make this meme while simultaneously asking others to trust their photos/videos as proof of flat Earth - videos of horizon looking flat, ships not disappearing, sun rays through clouds \"proving\" sun is close, etc. Same skepticism applied to flat Earth evidence would reveal issues: atmospheric refraction, insufficient altitude to see curvature, misunderstanding of perspective, misapplication of geometry. But flat Earthers don't apply critical analysis to their own side's images, only to NASA's. This selective skepticism reveals motivated reasoning - reject evidence contradicting flat Earth regardless of quality, accept evidence supporting flat Earth regardless of flaws. Dinosaur inclusion possibly references young Earth creationism's overlap with flat Earth movement (both reject scientific consensus about Earth, age, evolution). Some flat Earth supporters also believe dinosaurs coexisted with humans based on literal Bible interpretation, making cowboy-riding-dinosaur less absurd in their worldview than intended. Most Americans recognize dinosaurs extinct millions of years before humans, making image obviously impossible. But for young Earth creationists who believe Earth is 6,000-10,000 years old and all animals created simultaneously, humans and dinosaurs might have coexisted. This theological overlap between flat Earth and young Earth creationism suggests image working on multiple levels. Missile/rocket element particularly relevant: Flat Earthers question whether rockets work in vacuum, whether space travel possible, whether missiles follow claimed trajectories. Including missile in absurd composite associates real rocket technology with impossible fantasy scenario. Shark adds aquatic element - flat Earthers often discuss ocean navigation, ships' visibility over water, water's level surface as proof of flat Earth. Shark out of water is impossible, just as they claim satellites in orbit are impossible (\"sharks need water to survive, satellites need air to push against\" - both statements revealing misunderstanding of respective mediums and physics). Cowboy represents Western American frontier mythology - self-reliant individual who questions authority, trusts personal experience over expert testimony, values common sense over book learning. Archetype flat Earth movement identifies with: modern cowboys questioning scientific establishment, relying on own observations (\"I don't see curvature, so Earth must be flat\" parallels \"I know what I saw\" cowboy empiricism). Composite's absurdity is intentional - meant to be shared, laughed at, remembered. Serves as thought-terminating cliche: Instead of examining NASA's evidence, verification methods, independent confirmations, just think of cowboy-dinosaur meme and dismiss all space photography as potentially fake. Reduces complex epistemological question (how do we verify remote observations?) to simple meme-based skepticism. Effectiveness for flat Earth movement: Provides quick, memorable response to space photos. When shown ISS photo of Earth, flat Earther can respond \"It's on NASA website so must be real, right?\" with knowing sarcasm referencing this meme. Allows dismissal of evidence without engagement. Creates false equivalence between provable photos and absurdist fantasy. But false equivalence is propaganda technique, not logical argument. Real question isn't \"Can photos be faked?\" (answer: yes) but \"Are NASA's specific photos fake?\" (answer: no, verified through multiple independent sources). Meme confuses these questions. Ultimate message: Don't trust institutional sources (NASA, government, science agencies), trust only your own observations and alternative community (flat Earth). But human observations are limited - can't see entire Earth at once, can't see far enough to detect curvature without altitude, can't directly sense Earth's rotation, can't visit space without technology. Must rely on instruments, photographs, others' reports to understand phenomena beyond direct experience. Question becomes: Which sources trustworthy? Scientific consensus with peer review, replication, mathematical predictions, multi-national verification? Or YouTube videos and Facebook memes from people with no relevant expertise? Meme answers: Official sources untrustworthy, alternatives more reliable. But provides no method for distinguishing true alternative sources from false ones, creating epistemic chaos where anything can be believed or rejected based on tribal affiliation rather than evidence."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"15:T35d8,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Money pile meme questioning NASA's motives with $19.5 billion budget versus \"cartoon\" output.

Image uses dramatic visualization of money to emphasize scale of alleged motive. Background shows enormous warehouse-like space filled entirely with stacks of $100 bills. Perspective creates sense of vast scale - piles of bundled currency extending far into background becoming smaller with distance. Money stacks arranged in neat rows creating aisles between towering columns of cash. Each stack appears to be wrapped bundles of $100 bills (recognizable by greenish color, Benjamin Franklin portrait visible on some bills). Bundles appear standard bank-wrapped size (typically 100 bills = $10,000 per bundle). Stacks rise multiple bundles high creating walls of money taller than human height. Arrangement suggests organized storage in secure facility - possibly Federal Reserve vault, cash processing center, or fictional/staged representation of wealth. Lighting appears institutional - bright overhead lighting creating slight shadows between stacks emphasizing depth. Floor appears industrial - concrete or similar hard surface. Overall impression is astronomical amount of cash physically present. Color palette dominated by greenish hue of US currency. Bills show varying shades of green and beige/cream typical of $100 bills.

Text arranged in question-and-answer format building rhetorical argument: Top text poses rhetorical questions in two lines: \"WHY WOULD THEY LIE?\" and \"WHAT WOULD THEY GAIN?\" in white all-caps letters. Questions are core of conspiracy theory skepticism - often used to defend institutions (\"Why would NASA lie? What's their motive?\"). Meme answers these questions with financial motive. Center shows attribution \"fb.com/fematters\" in smaller white text. Middle text provides answer in two lines: \"NASA BUDGET FOR 2016:\" followed by \"$19.5 BILLION\" in large text. Answer to \"what would they gain\" is: nineteen and a half billion dollars per year. Massive budget creates powerful incentive to maintain appearance of successful space program regardless of reality. Bottom text delivers conclusion in two lines: \"WHAT DO WE GET? CARTOONS\" in white all-caps. Suggests NASA's output (space imagery, mission videos, satellite photos) are merely \"cartoons\" - CGI, animations, fabrications - rather than real photography from space. Implies taxpayer money wasted on fake content. Meme's argument embodies several conspiracy theory elements: 1) CUI BONO (WHO BENEFITS): Classic question in investigating crimes - who has motive? Meme establishes financial motive for NASA fraud. If NASA cannot actually reach space (because space doesn't exist, firmament prevents access, technology doesn't work, etc.), agency faces choice: admit failure and lose funding, or fake success and maintain budget. $19.5 billion annual budget is powerful incentive to fake rather than confess. 2) FOLLOW THE MONEY: Conspiracy theory methodology focusing on financial incentives as proof of corruption. Suggests wherever large money flows exist, fraud likely follows. NASA's substantial budget becomes evidence of fraud rather than evidence of expensive legitimate operations (spaceflight is genuinely expensive due to engineering challenges, fuel costs, safety requirements, research, personnel). 3) \"CARTOONS\" CLAIM: Flat Earth movement frequently dismisses NASA imagery as CGI, composites, or animations (\"cartoons\" is derogatory term suggesting childish fake content). Points to: composite images stitched from multiple satellite passes (necessary for full-Earth views), enhanced color images highlighting features (standard scientific imaging), graphic representations of data, mission animations used in presentations. Meme implies all NASA visual output is fabricated rather than real photography. 4) RETURN ON INVESTMENT QUESTION: \"What do we get?\" suggests NASA produces nothing of value for its budget. Ignores actual NASA outputs: satellite communications enabling GPS, weather forecasting, communications, earth observation; technological innovations (memory foam, water filtration, scratch-resistant lenses, cordless tools, insulin pumps derived from space technology); scientific discoveries about Earth, solar system, universe; satellite data for climate research, agriculture, disaster response; inspiration driving STEM education. \"Cartoons\" dismisses all tangible benefits. However, argument contains significant flaws: 1) BUDGET CONTEXT: $19.5 billion sounds enormous but represents 0.5% of federal budget (roughly $4 trillion in 2016). For comparison: US military budget ~$600 billion (30x more), Medicare ~$600 billion, Social Security ~$900 billion. NASA's budget is tiny fraction of government spending. Also, $19.5B funds all NASA operations: multiple satellite programs, ISS operations, planetary missions, aeronautics research, earth science, technology development, multiple NASA centers, thousands of employees. Spread across all activities, not unlimited funding for single purpose. 2) SPACEFLIGHT IS EXPENSIVE: Real space operations cost billions because: Rocket fuel costs millions per launch (Falcon 9 launch ~$60M, Space Shuttle launch ~$450M). R\u0026D for new technologies requires years of engineering. Safety requirements demand extensive testing, redundancy, quality control. Spacecraft must survive extreme conditions (vacuum, radiation, temperature extremes, vibration). Missions last years requiring long-term operations support. If spaceflight were fake, NASA could do it far cheaper - wouldn't need real rockets, real fuel, real engineering. Faking would cost far less than doing. Expensive operations actually confirm authenticity - fraud would be cheaper. 3) INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION: Space programs exist in Russia (Roscosmos), China (CNSA), Europe (ESA), India (ISRO), Japan (JAXA), private companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin). Each operates independently with separate budgets. For \"cartoon\" conspiracy to work, all these competitors would need to coordinate fake space imagery while competing in every other domain. Chinese/Russian programs wouldn't cooperate with US fraud during Cold War or current tensions. Multiple independent programs with consistent results confirm authenticity rather than suggesting coordinated conspiracy. 4) VERIFIABLE OUTPUTS: NASA produces verifiable products: Satellite images showing weather patterns matching ground observations, GPS satellites enabling navigation (anyone can verify GPS works), space station visible to naked eye from ground orbiting overhead on predictable schedule (thousands observe nightly), returned moon rocks studied by geologists worldwide, published research papers with data and methodology, live video streams from ISS, experiments conducted in microgravity producing results impossible to fake on Earth. \"Cartoons\" cannot explain functional satellites, visible space station, physical moon samples, microgravity fluid behavior videos. 5) WHISTLEBLOWER PROBLEM: NASA employs ~17,000 people directly plus hundreds of thousands of contractors. Maintaining fraud for 60+ years across multiple administrations, political parties, directors, involving hundreds of thousands of participants would require perfect secret-keeping. Historically, large conspiracies with many participants fail through leaks - whistleblowers expose fraud for money, fame, conscience. No credible NASA whistleblower has exposed space program as fake despite enormous incentive (fame, book deals, hero status). Silence of thousands suggests nothing to expose. 6) HISTORICAL COMPETITION: Cold War space race between US and Soviet Union was matter of national prestige and military credibility. If Apollo moon landings were fake, Soviet Union (with sophisticated space tracking, motivation to expose US fraud, propaganda value of revealing American lies) would have immediately exposed hoax rather than accepting defeat. Soviets tracked Apollo missions, confirmed lunar transmissions, acknowledged US success. Enemy verification is stronger proof than ally confirmation. Photo composition creates emotional impact: Vast warehouse of cash creates visceral reaction - \"that's too much money, something corrupt must be happening.\" Visualization makes abstract number ($19.5B) concrete and overwhelming. Suggests greed, waste, corruption. However, image likely doesn't show $19.5 billion - even in $100 bills (highest US currency in circulation), $19.5B would be 195 million bills weighing 195 tons. Image probably shows far less, selected because it looks impressive rather than accurately representing stated amount. This itself is ironic - meme accusing NASA of fake imagery uses likely staged or exaggerated imagery to make argument. \"CARTOONS\" SPECIFICS: Flat Earthers point to specific images as proof of CGI: \"Blue Marble\" Earth photos showing slightly different continent sizes between years (explained by different satellite distances, camera angles, atmospheric effects). Composite images where clouds repeat (sometimes true due to image stitching errors, usually corrected when identified). ISS footage with bubbles/debris floating (mistaken for water bubbles, actually ice particles or debris in vacuum). Astronaut photos with wires/harnesses visible (lens flares, tethers, image artifacts misidentified). But professional forensic analysis of NASA imagery confirms authenticity: Lighting angles match sun position for claimed times/locations. Shadow angles consistent with single distant light source (sun). Physics of spacecraft motion matches orbital mechanics. Weather patterns in satellite images match meteorological data from ground observations. Geography matches Earth as mapped from ground over centuries. No evidence of green screens, CGI artifacts, impossible physics. Image selection (money warehouse) reveals psychological appeal: Creates association between NASA and greed/corruption. Triggers anger about tax dollars wasted. Simplifies complex issue into binary choice - either NASA does real expensive spaceflight, or NASA produces cheap cartoons and pockets difference. Ignores nuance, complexity, actual operations. Rhetorical question format (\"Why would they lie? What would they gain?\") is propaganda technique: Presents motive as proof of action. But motive alone doesn't prove crime - need evidence of fraud itself. Many people have motive for crimes they don't commit. Opportunity + motive ≠ proof. Actual investigation would examine evidence: Do NASA operations match claimed activities? Yes - rockets launch, satellites orbit, station is visible, physics works. Therefore budget supports real operations rather than funding fraud. Alternative reading of \"what do we get\": Satellite communications worth hundreds of billions to global economy. GPS enabling $1.4 trillion in economic activity annually. Weather forecasting saving lives and property (hurricane predictions, storm tracking). Earth observation for agriculture, climate research, disaster response. Technology spinoffs improving daily life. Scientific understanding of universe. Return on NASA investment is estimated 7-to-1 or higher - every dollar invested returns $7 to economy through technologies, industries enabled. \"Cartoons\" dismissal ignores massive tangible benefits. Meme's ultimate message: NASA wastes taxpayer money producing fake content. But message relies on ignoring evidence of real outputs, dismissing international competition, assuming massive conspiracy without whistleblowers, and confusing motive with proof. Financial incentive exists, but so does verification - real missions, observable satellites, physical evidence, independent confirmation. Presence of budget doesn't prove fraud any more than police budget proves all arrests are fake. Effectiveness comes from: Simple visual (money = corruption), large number ($19.5B impresses), rhetorical structure (poses question, provides answer), emotional appeal (anger at waste), confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust government see budget as proof of fraud). Works as thought-terminating cliche - instead of examining evidence for space program authenticity, just remember \"huge budget, produces cartoons\" and dismiss entire program as fraud. However, critical examination reveals argument is shallow: Spaceflight costs billions because engineering is genuinely expensive. Budget enables real operations verified independently worldwide. \"Cartoons\" dismisses mountains of physical evidence, functional satellites, observable spacecraft, international competition. Motive (budget) doesn't prove crime (fraud) without evidence fraud occurred. Investigation shows operations are authentic, so budget funds real spaceflight rather than elaborate fake. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) reveals worldview: Must establish NASA as corrupt, faking space missions, because authentic space photography proves Earth is spherical. Attacking NASA's credibility is necessary for maintaining flat Earth belief. Financial motive argument supports broader narrative that institutions are corrupt, experts are lying, only conspiracy community tells truth.

Humorous meme format using police booking photo aesthetic to mock astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for scientifically accurate statement about Earth's actual shape. Image presents Tyson as \"criminal\" whose crime was saying truth that flat Earthers interpret as contradiction proving conspiracy. Format mimics standard police booking photographs taken during arrest processing. Background shows height measurement wall - gray horizontal lines with height markings in feet and inches visible on left side (10', 8', 6' markers visible). Creates authentic police lineup/mugshot aesthetic suggesting Tyson being arrested or processed. Subject is Neil deGrasse Tyson shown in two standard booking photo angles: LEFT SIDE shows frontal view - Tyson facing camera directly with neutral expression typical of booking photos. Face clearly recognizable - dark skin, short dark curly hair, mustache, wide-set eyes looking directly at camera with slight concern or seriousness. Wearing dark V-neck shirt or sweater showing chest hair. Shoulders squared to camera. Expression shows no emotion, following standard booking photo protocol where subjects told to maintain neutral face. RIGHT SIDE shows profile view - Tyson's head turned 90 degrees showing right side profile. Same neutral expression, mustache visible in profile, ear visible, short hair showing texture. Profile angle reveals facial structure, nose shape, jawline. Both photos appear same session with identical clothing, lighting, background. Photo quality appears grainy/low resolution typical of older institutional photography or intentionally degraded to appear more authentic to mugshot aesthetic. Black and white or desaturated color scheme enhances vintage booking photo feel. Bottom of image shows name plate typical of booking photos: White text on black background reading \"NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON\" in all caps, with partial number visible \"12122\" suggesting booking or case number. Name plate positioning matches authentic police photo format where identification information displayed below subject. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for contrast and readability. Top text reads: \"SAID THE EARTH IS PEAR SHAPED\" in all caps describing Tyson's \"crime\" - stating scientific fact about Earth's actual shape. Bottom text reads: \"FORGOT ABOUT 50 YEARS OF FAKE NASA PHOTOS\" in all caps suggesting Tyson's error was contradicting supposed consistency of faked NASA imagery by revealing Earth isn't perfect sphere. Center of image shows \"fb.com/fematters\" attribution in gray text. Meme's argument operates on several misconceptions: 1) PEAR-SHAPED EARTH STATEMENT: Neil deGrasse Tyson has accurately stated Earth is not perfect sphere but oblate spheroid - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation. More precisely, Earth is very slightly pear-shaped with southern hemisphere marginally larger than northern hemisphere by tiny amount (difference of ~30 feet in 8,000 mile diameter - 0.0004% variation). This is measurable scientific fact confirmed by satellite geodesy, gravitational measurements, precise surveying. Tyson's statement reflects current scientific understanding of Earth's actual shape. 2) PERCEIVED CONTRADICTION: Flat Earthers interpret \"pear-shaped\" statement as contradiction of NASA photos showing Earth as sphere. Argument suggests: If Earth truly spherical as NASA photos show for 50+ years, why does Tyson now say it's pear-shaped? Must be lying about something - either old photos are fake (showing perfect sphere when Earth is actually pear) or Tyson is wrong now. Flat Earthers choose interpretation that old photos are fake, proving NASA has been lying for decades. 3) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Earth's pear-shape variation is so minuscule it's imperceptible in photographs. At 0.0004% variation, difference between perfect sphere and Earth's actual shape is invisible to human eye at planetary scale. Like describing perfectly round basketball that's 0.0004% asymmetrical - you'd never notice unless measuring with precision instruments. NASA photos correctly show Earth appearing spherical because at photographic resolution, the tiny pear-shaped variation is far below visible threshold. Photos are accurate representations of what Earth looks like - spherical with imperceptible asymmetry. 4) SCIENTIFIC PRECISION VS VISUAL APPEARANCE: Science requires precision beyond visual observation. Saying Earth is spherical is correct for general purposes - planet is round, not flat. Saying Earth is oblate spheroid is more precise - round but slightly flattened. Saying Earth is pear-shaped oblate spheroid is even more precise - accounts for southern hemisphere's tiny extra bulge. Each statement is true at different precision levels. Analogous to describing someone's height: \"about 6 feet\" vs \"6 feet 1/4 inch\" vs \"6 feet 0.237 inches\" - all correct, increasing precision. Visual photos show \"round\" which is accurate at visible scale. Precise measurements show \"pear-shaped\" which is accurate at measurement precision. No contradiction. 5) \"FAKE NASA PHOTOS\" CLAIM: Meme suggests NASA photos are fabricated because they don't show pear shape. But photos DO show Earth's actual shape accurately - at photographic resolution, Earth appears spherical because pear-shaped variation is submicroscopic relative to planet size. If NASA were faking photos, they wouldn't bother making them show perfect sphere - they'd include accurate oblate spheroid shape and tiny pear asymmetry in renderings to match known measurements. Fact that photos show apparently perfect sphere actually confirms they're real photographs, not CGI optimized to match measurements. Real photographs show what human eyes would see - round planet. CGI would show mathematically perfect shape including all measured asymmetries. MUGSHOT FORMAT creates humorous suggestion that stating scientific truth is criminal offense. Implies Tyson \"caught\" in contradiction, being arrested for exposing NASA lies. But mugshot is photoshopped composite - Tyson never actually arrested, images are edited to create booking photo appearance. Format serves to mock and discredit Tyson rather than engage with scientific accuracy of his statements. Neil deGrasse Tyson frequently targeted by flat Earth movement because: As prominent science communicator and astrophysicist, he represents mainstream scientific establishment that flat Earthers oppose. His media presence (hosted Cosmos reboot, frequent TV appearances, social media following) makes him highly visible advocate for scientific consensus. His confident, sometimes condescending communication style can be polarizing, making him target for ridicule. He's defended spherical Earth, space exploration, NASA against conspiracy theories, making him enemy of flat Earth movement. His statements about Earth's precise shape give flat Earthers perceived ammunition for \"gotcha\" contradictions. Historical context of Earth's shape understanding: Ancient Greeks knew Earth was spherical (Eratosthenes measured circumference 240 BCE using shadows). Newton predicted oblate spheroid shape due to rotation (1687). Precise measurements confirmed oblate spheroid with polar flattening (equatorial diameter ~27 miles larger than polar diameter). Modern satellite geodesy revealed tiny pear-shaped asymmetry (southern hemisphere slightly larger than northern by ~30 feet). Each advance in precision refined understanding without contradicting previous knowledge - Earth is round, more precisely oblate spheroid, even more precisely pear-shaped oblate spheroid. All statements correct at respective precision levels. Photos from space confirmed visual appearance matches scientific models. Meme's \"50 years of fake NASA photos\" references period from 1960s (early space age) to present. Suggests consistent imagery over decades is evidence of fabrication rather than evidence of authenticity. But consistency over 50+ years across multiple nations, agencies, private companies, with geography matching ground-based maps, weather patterns matching meteorological data, and visible features consistent over time actually proves authenticity. Maintaining fake consistency would be far harder than taking real photos. Joke in meme works through false dichotomy: Either NASA photos show perfect sphere (and are therefore fake because Earth is actually pear-shaped), or Tyson is wrong about pear shape. Ignores third option that both are correct - Earth appears spherical in photos because pear asymmetry is imperceptible at visible scale, while precise measurements reveal tiny pear shape invisible in photographs. Format also contains irony: Using criminal mugshot to mock scientist for stating accurate scientific fact reflects anti-intellectual strain in conspiracy movements where education and expertise seen as crimes rather than virtues. Scientist \"arrested\" for truth-telling inverts reality where conspiracy theorists see themselves as truth-tellers persecuted by establishment. Tyson becomes avatar for scientific establishment that flat Earthers believe is lying. Effectiveness comes from: Accessible format (mugshot is universally recognized), humor (absurdity of arresting scientist for scientific statement), perceived contradiction (pear vs sphere), and confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust NASA see this as evidence of lies). Weakness: Anyone understanding scale and precision recognizes no contradiction exists. Pear-shaped variation of 0.0004% is invisible in photos, so photos accurately show apparent sphere while measurements reveal imperceptible asymmetry. Both Tyson's statement and NASA photos are correct. Meme also serves flat Earth community function: Provides quick dismissal of Tyson's credibility. When Tyson cited as authority on Earth's shape, flat Earthers can reference this meme - \"he said pear-shaped contradicting NASA, so he's unreliable\" - without engaging with actual science. Creates perception of inconsistency in scientific community when no real inconsistency exists. Bottom line: Meme misrepresents both Tyson's statement (which is scientifically accurate) and NASA photos (which are authentic representations of Earth's appearance). Creates false contradiction by conflating visible appearance with measured asymmetry at sub-visual precision level. Uses humor and mugshot format to discredit science communicator rather than examining evidence. Assumes audience won't understand scale of asymmetry (0.0004%) or relationship between photographic representation and measurement precision."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"Other 373 | ZZZ Daily Images\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Neil deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos.
