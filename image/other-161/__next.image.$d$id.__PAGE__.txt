3:T48d,Gravity contradiction meme with seagull flying over ocean. Shows beautiful seascape with dark blue-green ocean water in foreground with small waves and whitecaps. Seagull with white body and gray wings flies in center of image with wings spread wide in mid-flight. Background shows dark blue mountain range or coastal hills under light blue sky with white fluffy clouds. Top text in large white letters: 'GRAVITY'. Left text: 'Strong enough to hold the oceans to a spinning ball.' with bright green downward arrow pointing at water. Right text: 'Yet weak enough that birds can still fly.' with bright green downward arrow pointing at bird. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme points out perceived contradiction in gravity's strength - argues gravity must be strong enough to prevent oceans from flying off spinning Earth (centrifugal force) yet simultaneously weak enough not to prevent birds from flying. Questions how same force can be both powerful (holding massive oceans) and negligible (birds easily overcome it). Flat Earth argument suggests if gravity were real and strong enough to hold oceans to spinning sphere, birds shouldn't be able to fly against such force4:T579,Samuel Birley Rowbotham quote over stunning twilight castle photograph. Shows famous Chillon Castle on Lake Geneva, Switzerland at dusk. Medieval stone castle with cylindrical towers, turrets, and battlements sits on rocky outcrop extending into calm lake water. Warm golden lighting illuminates castle's yellow-beige stone walls. Castle reflection perfectly mirrored in still dark blue water below. Left side shows silhouetted mountain range extending into distance. Sky transitions from deep blue at top through pink-lavender tones to lighter blue near horizon. Lake surface appears completely flat and mirror-smooth. White text overlay at top reads: 'The facts and experiments already advanced render it undeniable, that the surface of all the waters of the earth is horizontal; and that, however irregular the upper outline of the land itself may be, the whole mass, land and water together, constitutes an IMMENSE NON-MOVING CIRCULAR PLANE.' Attribution: '- Samuel Birley Rowbotham'. Bottom left watermark 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Quote from Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816-1884), founder of modern flat Earth movement who wrote under pseudonym 'Parallax'. His book 'Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe' (1865) laid foundation for contemporary flat Earth arguments. Quote presents water's levelness as empirical proof Earth is stationary flat plane rather than rotating sphere5:T4c2,Breathtaking photograph of Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia with water level message. Shows world's largest salt flat during rainy season when thin layer of water creates perfect mirror effect. Lone person wearing dark clothing and backpack stands in center, body and reflection creating symmetrical composition. Person appears as silhouette with perfect mirror image below. Sky shows brilliant blue with scattered white puffy clouds that reflect identically in water below, creating surreal effect where sky and ground are indistinguishable. Horizon line between sky and water reflection is nearly invisible. Clouds appear both above and below central figure. Water surface appears absolutely flat and level like perfect mirror. Top text in bold white outlined letters: 'WATER ALWAYS FINDS'. Bottom text: 'ITS LEVEL'. Bottom right shows 'JM' watermark. Uses one of nature's most spectacular mirror phenomena to argue water's fundamental property is seeking perfectly level surface. Salar de Uyuni's mirror effect demonstrates water's levelness over vast distance (10,000+ square kilometers). Argues if Earth were curved sphere, water couldn't create such perfect flat mirror extending to horizon in all directions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-161","title":"Other 161","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489370_453802371486169_2039646002526105486_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-160","title":"Other 160","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489299_452833058249767_7799870234697648772_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-162","title":"Other 162","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489461_451075195092220_5529820826441455258_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
