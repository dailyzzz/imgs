5:T48d,Gravity contradiction meme with seagull flying over ocean. Shows beautiful seascape with dark blue-green ocean water in foreground with small waves and whitecaps. Seagull with white body and gray wings flies in center of image with wings spread wide in mid-flight. Background shows dark blue mountain range or coastal hills under light blue sky with white fluffy clouds. Top text in large white letters: 'GRAVITY'. Left text: 'Strong enough to hold the oceans to a spinning ball.' with bright green downward arrow pointing at water. Right text: 'Yet weak enough that birds can still fly.' with bright green downward arrow pointing at bird. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme points out perceived contradiction in gravity's strength - argues gravity must be strong enough to prevent oceans from flying off spinning Earth (centrifugal force) yet simultaneously weak enough not to prevent birds from flying. Questions how same force can be both powerful (holding massive oceans) and negligible (birds easily overcome it). Flat Earth argument suggests if gravity were real and strong enough to hold oceans to spinning sphere, birds shouldn't be able to fly against such force0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 161 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Gravity contradiction meme with seagull flying over ocean.
