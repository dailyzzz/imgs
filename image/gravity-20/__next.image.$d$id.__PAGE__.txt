3:T435,Complex alternative physics diagram comparing diamagnetism versus gravity. Top left shows flat Earth model with dome and text 'THE SUN AND MOON ARE CAUGHT IN EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD' with green magnetic field lines and caption explaining 24-hour rotation. Top right shows similar dome with downward magnetic force labeled 'THE MAGNETIC FIELD ALSO HAS A DOWNWARD FORCE' explaining diamagnetism as substitute for gravity. Middle section titled 'DIAMAGNETISM (VS) MASSES BENDING SPACE:' shows three panels: left with mouse being repelled by magnets labeled 'MOUSE IS REPELLED IN REAL-TIME' referencing diamagnetism, center showing diagram of curved spacetime grid with arrows and 'OBSERVER MUST STAND BACK & RELY ON MEASUREMENT' labeled 'CAVENDISH!', right showing clock and Nikola Tesla quote about space curvature being incorrect. Bottom shows Newton quote describing aether as medium through which light flows and magnetic field is distributed, concluding 'Earth's magnetic field is the aether.' Proposes diamagnetism and magnetic fields explain phenomena attributed to gravity.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-20","title":"Gravity 20","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/43155466_2137461599618691_7730291390147461120_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel meme criticizing gravitational wave detection.

Top text in bold white and orange: 'WHEN METAL IS HEATED IT LOSES ITS MAGNETIC PROPERTIES' with Discovery News logo. Center shows Blue Marble Earth photo and cutaway diagram of Earth's interior layers (crust, mantle, outer core in red/orange, inner core in yellow) with glowing heated appearance. Bottom text in white: 'GRAVITY DEPENDS ON THE THEORY OF MAGNETISM GENERATED BY A SUPER HEATED MOLTEN METAL INNER CORE.' with 'edgp.com' watermark. Argues logical contradiction: if heated metal loses magnetism (Curie point), Earth's molten metal core cannot generate magnetic field, yet gravity theory supposedly depends on Earth's magnetic core. Actually conflates two separate phenomena - gravity (mass attraction) and magnetism (electromagnetic field) - which mainstream science treats as distinct forces"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-21","title":"Gravity 21","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/50429465_2310032875945807_1420219769230983168_n.jpeg","description":"$3"}}],null,["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","$5",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@6"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
