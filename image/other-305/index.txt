13:T8a0,Side-eyeing Chloe meme about believing spherical Earth despite no visible curvature. Popular internet meme using viral child's skeptical expression. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'NO ONE CAN FIND ANY CURVATURE'. Image shows young blonde girl (Chloe from "Side Eyeing Chloe" meme) sitting in car seat giving intensely skeptical sideways glance. Girl appears approximately 2-3 years old with long straight blonde hair, fair complexion. She wears purple/magenta colored shirt or jacket. Facial expression shows narrowed eyes looking to side with incredulous, unimpressed, judging look - signature expression from viral video where she reacts skeptically to parents' announcement. Gray car interior visible in background with black car seat. Lower right shows 'FEM' watermark (Flat Earth Matters). Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'AND YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S A BALL'. Meme uses child's naturally skeptical expression to mock belief in spherical Earth when curvature allegedly can't be observed. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with alleged 8 inches per mile squared drop, curvature should be easily visible - since people don't see obvious curve, Earth must be flat. However, Earth's radius is 6,371 km (3,959 miles) making curvature imperceptible at human scale on ground level. Curvature becomes visible from altitude: commercial aircraft at 35,000 feet show slight curve (about 3 degrees of horizon), high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curve, ISS at 400 km shows obvious spherical Earth. From ground, horizon distance limited by observer height - at 6 feet tall, geometric horizon only 3 miles away, too short distance to show noticeable curve. However, ships disappearing hull-first over horizon demonstrates curvature. Long-distance photography across large bodies of water also shows hidden portions due to curve. Mathematics of sphere means local area appears flat while global shape is curved - similar to how small section of basketball appears nearly flat when viewed close-up. Meme format originated from viral YouTube video showing Chloe's reaction to Disney trip announcement, became widespread reaction image for skepticism14:T9ed,Glowing brain with light beams encouraging independent research and knowledge. Motivational image featuring illuminated brain illustration with empowerment message. Top text in large bold white letters: 'I CAN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND WITH A FACEBOOK ARGUMENT. THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.' Center displays 3D rendered human brain in glowing electric blue color appearing translucent/x-ray style showing anatomical details - cerebral cortex with characteristic folds and wrinkles (gyri and sulci), hemispheres clearly defined, realistic proportions. Brain appears illuminated from within creating luminous effect. Brain surrounded by translucent gray sphere (possibly representing skull or aura) with multiple bright white/blue light beams radiating outward in all directions creating starburst pattern - beams emanate from brain suggesting enlightenment, knowledge transmission, mental energy, or thought projection. Each beam has bright white core with soft blue glow. Some beams have bright white spherical nodes/points along their length suggesting neural connections or information nodes. Background pure black emphasizing glowing brain effect. Bottom text in two lines, top line white: 'DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.' Bottom line in bright electric blue large bold letters: 'KNOWLEDGE IS POWER'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Image encourages independent investigation rather than accepting arguments during online debates. Suggests genuine understanding requires personal exploration, not being convinced through social media arguments. 'Knowledge is power' implies self-education leads to empowerment and truth. Message resonates across political spectrum - liberals and conservatives both use format encouraging independent thinking. However, in conspiracy theory context, 'do your own research' often leads people to confirmation bias echo chambers, YouTube videos lacking peer review, cherry-picked data, misunderstanding of scientific concepts. Without foundation in critical thinking, research methodology, statistics, and source evaluation, 'research' can reinforce misconceptions. Professional scientists spend decades learning research methods. Effective research requires: understanding primary vs secondary sources, evaluating study methodology, recognizing logical fallacies, mathematical literacy, ability to synthesize contradictory information. Facebook arguments indeed ineffective for changing minds, but solution isn't necessarily amateur research - it's developing better information literacy and epistemological humility15:T9ed,Earth's multiple motions with gyroscope stability argument meme. Two-panel educational image arguing gyroscopes would malfunction if Earth had complex motion. Top section shows scientific visualization of solar system motion on black starfield background. Central yellow-orange sun shown as glowing sphere with corona. Curved blue orbital paths trace Earth's movement - multiple elliptical and spiral trajectories overlapping showing Earth's simultaneous motions. Yellow arrow/beam extends from orbital region toward sun suggesting directional movement. Small spheres visible representing planets at different orbital positions - one appears moon-like (gray), another Earth-like (blue-green), yellow/tan planet possibly Venus or Mars. Complex interweaving blue curves illustrate compound motion: Earth rotating on axis, orbiting sun, sun moving through galaxy, galaxy moving through space. White text overlays in sans-serif font: 'IF THIS WAS TRUE', 'EARTH IS ROTATING AT 1,000 MPH' (equatorial rotation speed), 'WHILE REVOLVING AROUND SUN AT 66,600 MPH' (orbital velocity), 'AS THE SUN IS BLASTING THROUGH SPACE AT 450,000 MPH' (solar system's motion through Milky Way). Bottom section displays labeled diagram of mechanical gyroscope on white background. Cross-sectional view shows components: outer 'Gyroscope frame' (gray ring), middle 'Outer gimbal' and 'Inner gimbal' (red/pink rings allowing rotation on multiple axes), central 'Rotor' (yellow disc representing spinning mass), vertical 'Spin axis' (pink rod through center). Diagram demonstrates gimbal suspension allowing rotor to maintain orientation regardless of frame movement. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'ALL GYROSCOPES WOULD BE GOING APE SHIT'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Meme argues if Earth had multiple simultaneous high-speed motions in different directions, gyroscopes would show chaotic behavior rather than stable orientation. However, this misunderstands inertial reference frames and gyroscope physics. Gyroscopes maintain orientation relative to local inertial frame - since all objects on/near Earth share same motions, there's no relative motion to detect. Similar to how gyroscope on moving airplane maintains stability - detects aircraft rotation, not Earth's motion beneath. Earth's rotation IS detectable by precision gyroscopes (demonstrated by Foucault pendulum, ring laser gyroscopes, fiber optic gyroscopes used in navigation), but orbital and galactic motion irrelevant because we're in same reference frame9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-305","title":"Other 305","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745681_468153193384420_7173330056612754937_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-304","title":"Other 304","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745629_467817330084673_4204127754865800614_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-306","title":"Other 306","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745760_465537190312687_3964998623303873642_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
