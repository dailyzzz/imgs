5:T8a0,Side-eyeing Chloe meme about believing spherical Earth despite no visible curvature. Popular internet meme using viral child's skeptical expression. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'NO ONE CAN FIND ANY CURVATURE'. Image shows young blonde girl (Chloe from "Side Eyeing Chloe" meme) sitting in car seat giving intensely skeptical sideways glance. Girl appears approximately 2-3 years old with long straight blonde hair, fair complexion. She wears purple/magenta colored shirt or jacket. Facial expression shows narrowed eyes looking to side with incredulous, unimpressed, judging look - signature expression from viral video where she reacts skeptically to parents' announcement. Gray car interior visible in background with black car seat. Lower right shows 'FEM' watermark (Flat Earth Matters). Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'AND YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S A BALL'. Meme uses child's naturally skeptical expression to mock belief in spherical Earth when curvature allegedly can't be observed. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with alleged 8 inches per mile squared drop, curvature should be easily visible - since people don't see obvious curve, Earth must be flat. However, Earth's radius is 6,371 km (3,959 miles) making curvature imperceptible at human scale on ground level. Curvature becomes visible from altitude: commercial aircraft at 35,000 feet show slight curve (about 3 degrees of horizon), high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curve, ISS at 400 km shows obvious spherical Earth. From ground, horizon distance limited by observer height - at 6 feet tall, geometric horizon only 3 miles away, too short distance to show noticeable curve. However, ships disappearing hull-first over horizon demonstrates curvature. Long-distance photography across large bodies of water also shows hidden portions due to curve. Mathematics of sphere means local area appears flat while global shape is curved - similar to how small section of basketball appears nearly flat when viewed close-up. Meme format originated from viral YouTube video showing Chloe's reaction to Disney trip announcement, became widespread reaction image for skepticism0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 305 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Side-eyeing Chloe meme about believing spherical Earth despite no visible curvature.
