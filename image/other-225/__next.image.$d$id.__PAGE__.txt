3:T591,Antarctic Treaty flag design with azimuthal projection. Shows simplified flag or emblem design on dark navy blue background. Center displays white silhouette of Antarctica continent showing irregular coastline with peninsulas, bays, indentations. Antarctica positioned at center with North Pole/Arctic perspective. Surrounding continent are concentric white circles representing latitude lines at regular intervals. Radiating from center point are straight white lines extending outward like compass rays or longitude lines - approximately 12-16 lines creating pie-slice sections. Lines extend beyond outer circle to edges of image. Design creates azimuthal equidistant projection pattern with Antarctica at pole position. This is actual design of Antarctic Treaty flag adopted in 1959, also used as United Nations emblem. Flat Earth proponents cite this flag as evidence that governments know true Earth map. Argue Antarctica positioned at center with radiating longitude lines matches flat Earth model where Antarctica forms ice wall perimeter and continents radiate from North Pole center. Antarctic Treaty of 1959 established Antarctica as scientific preserve and banned military activity. Conspiracy theorists claim treaty exists to prevent exploration of ice wall and keep flat Earth secret. UN flag uses identical azimuthal equidistant projection, which flat Earthers interpret as hidden truth displayed in plain sight4:T58a,Aerial photograph above clouds showing flat horizon with Mount Fuji. Shows stunning high-altitude aerial view from airplane window. Sky gradient from deep navy blue at top transitioning to lighter blue in middle section. Thick layer of white-gray clouds fills lower two-thirds creating cotton-like textured blanket extending to horizon. Clouds show variations in density, some areas thicker white, others wispy translucent. Most prominent feature: snow-capped Mount Fuji (iconic Japanese volcano) rising through cloud layer in lower center-right. Mountain shows distinctive symmetrical cone shape with white snow covering peak, darker volcanic rock visible on slopes, shadow cast on clouds below. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across image where clouds meet sky. Perspective from high altitude (likely 30,000-40,000 feet commercial flight). Top displays large white text: 'FLATNESS'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Image used as evidence that horizon always appears flat at eye level regardless of altitude. Flat Earth proponents argue if Earth were sphere, horizon should show visible curve from this altitude. Claims flat horizon proves flat plane rather than curved surface. Mainstream science explains horizon appears flat due to Earth's large size (8,000 mile diameter) - curvature is too gradual to perceive from these altitudes without fisheye lens5:T547,Steve Harvey meme mocking Family Feud wrong answer format. Shows Steve Harvey, comedian and television host, on stage in formal attire. Harvey wears black tuxedo jacket with subtle pattern or texture, white dress shirt, black bow tie. Clean-shaven bald head, distinctive thick black mustache, wide white-toothed smile showing enthusiasm. Holds black microphone in right hand near mouth as if announcing or reacting. Left hand gestures expressively. Background shows dark teal-blue with blurred stage lights creating bokeh effect - suggests TV studio setting like Family Feud game show which Harvey hosts. Body language conveys animated, dramatic reaction typical of his comedic hosting style. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'THE EARTH IS A SPINNING BALL'. Meme format mimics Family Feud show where Harvey reacts to contestants giving obviously wrong answers with exaggerated disbelief. Implies belief in spinning globe Earth is comically wrong answer equivalent to absurd Family Feud responses. Harvey's enthusiastic delivery makes statement appear ridiculous. Uses humor to frame mainstream cosmology as laughable rather than scientifically established. Leverages Harvey's comedic persona and Family Feud's wrong-answer culture to delegitimize globe Earth model0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-225","title":"Other 225","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657265_461770377356035_3408845659044911063_o.png","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-224","title":"Other 224","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654693_460135770852829_6611736404814185123_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-226","title":"Other 226","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657953_462403280626078_1359173339570927437_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
