13:T5da,Antarctic ice shelf with false-color green terrain showing massive ice wall. Shows aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape with unusual green false-color processing. Left side and foreground dominated by bright green colored terrain representing ice shelf or Antarctic landmass - vivid lime-green to forest-green coloring creates striking artificial appearance. Green surface shows topographic features, slopes, undulations suggesting three-dimensional terrain. Center features massive white ice cliff or wall - sheer vertical face where ice shelf meets ocean or lower elevation. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Wall shows brilliant white coloring with blue-gray shadows and stratified layers visible. Some sections show irregular breaks where ice has calved. Right side and upper portion shows flat gray-white surface representing ocean, sea ice, or cloud cover extending to horizon. Surface appears uniform with slight texture. Far background displays snow-covered mountain peaks in pale blue-gray - two distinct peaks visible rising above horizon line. Sky shows light blue gradient suggesting clear polar conditions. No text or watermarks visible. Image processing likely uses satellite or aerial survey data with false-color to enhance terrain features. Green coloring helps differentiate ice elevation zones. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic ice imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter surrounding flat Earth disc14:T5fc,Density and buoyancy diagram explaining floating objects without gravity. Shows educational physics diagram on black background with light blue fluid section at bottom. Illustrates scientific principle of buoyancy as alternative to gravitational explanation. Top section (black) shows large gray downward-pointing arrow labeled 'Density' at top. Left side displays 'm subscript object' in yellow/orange text with notation '(mass of the object)' below in orange. Yellow-orange dashed rectangle frames spherical object in center. Sphere shown in tan-beige-brown gradient showing three-dimensional shading. Sphere labeled 'ρ subscript object' with notation '(density of the object)' in gray. Sphere partially submerged at interface between black top section and light blue bottom section representing fluid. Bottom section (light blue) represents fluid medium. Lower left shows 'ρ subscript fluid' in black text with notation '(density of the fluid)' below. Bottom center displays large light blue upward-pointing arrow labeled 'Buoyancy' in white text at bottom. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in light gray. Diagram demonstrates Archimedes principle: object floats or sinks based on density relationship between object and surrounding fluid. Flat Earth proponents argue this explains rising/falling without requiring gravity - objects simply seek their natural density level in medium. Claims hot air balloons rise because hot air is less dense than cold air, not because they overcome gravitational force15:T614,Shrek donkey character with NASA etymology claiming Hebrew word for deception. Shows CGI character Donkey from Shrek animated films against dark brown-gray textured background. Donkey has gray-brown fur, large expressive eyes with yellow-green irises looking directly at camera with enthusiastic toothy grin showing prominent white teeth. Long gray ears pointed upward. Character wears white space suit or astronaut costume with visible American flag patches on shoulders showing stars and stripes. Background suggests indoor setting possibly spacecraft interior or space station. Upper left and upper right corners display identical NASA logos (blue circle with red chevron, white letters) with large red diagonal lines striking through logos. Red text overlaid on logos reads 'LIARS' in capital letters. Top center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Lower portion displays black text box with white text explaining: 'NASA: "nasha" in ancient Hebrew can also be spelled without the 'h'. It is pronounced naw-shaw, and means "a great deception" or "to deceive".' Below shows pink highlighted dictionary excerpt with Hebrew characters and definition: Strong's reference number 5377 showing 'nasha' verb meaning 'to deceive, greatly deceived, to deceive, deceive greatly, beguiled, seize, utterly forget'. Etymology argument claims NASA's name reveals its purpose as deception agency. However, NASA is acronym for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, not Hebrew word. Conspiracy theory uses linguistic coincidence to suggest intentional occult naming9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-253","title":"Other 253","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698719_461770264022713_8561603609258010225_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-252","title":"Other 252","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698648_463798983819841_2655086343656313495_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-254","title":"Other 254","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705370_461439577389115_2275386566848647093_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
