13:T58c,Antarctic ice shelf formation with massive vertical ice walls and sea ice. Shows dramatic aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape from elevated perspective. Left and center dominated by massive tabular ice shelf with sheer vertical ice cliffs or walls. Ice cliff appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image, showing pristine white-blue ice with stratified layers visible in face. Wall shows irregular geometric breaks and sections where ice has fractured or calved. Top surface of shelf appears flat extending into distance. Right side and foreground shows dark navy-blue ocean water with scattered white ice fragments, brash ice, and small icebergs floating on surface. Water shows ripple patterns and darker patches. Middle distance shows larger white ice floes and tabular icebergs in various sizes scattered across water. Far background displays distant Antarctic ice formations or mountains with flat-topped profiles. Sky shows light gray-blue overcast conditions typical of polar regions with horizontal cloud layers. Horizon line visible in far distance. No text or watermarks. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual evidence of Antarctic 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing water from flowing off edges and restricting access to regions beyond Antarctica. Antarctic Treaty cited as conspiracy to prevent exploration14:T587,Two-panel Jurassic Park meme about Earth curvature dismissal. Shows scenes from Jurassic Park (1993) film in outdoor tropical setting with palm trees and thatched roof structures. Top panel shows two men at wooden picnic table. Left: man in red polo shirt and sunglasses. Right: larger man in colorful Hawaiian shirt with blue-pink-purple floral pattern, arms crossed, pointing and speaking with animated expression. Text overlay: 'THIS GUY'S SEEN THE CURVATURE HE'S SEEN IT!' Background shows greenery, wooden structures, tropical resort atmosphere. Bottom panel shows closer view of same scene. Left: partial view of man in red shirt. Right: same Hawaiian-shirted man now with dismissive expression, glasses visible, gesturing with hand in 'whatever' motion. Watermark visible: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SEE? NOBODY CARES'. References famous Jurassic Park scene where Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) dismisses John Hammond's concerns. Original scene: 'See? Nobody cares' about Dodgson's identity. Meme repurposes dialogue to mock claims of seeing Earth's curvature. Suggests even if someone claims to have observed curvature, flat Earth community dismisses it as irrelevant or fabricated. Implies personal testimony about curvature carries no weight. Uses humor to deflect mainstream evidence while reinforcing in-group consensus that curvature is unobservable15:T5fa,Training Day meme mocking gravitational waves discovery with Denzel Washington. Shows scene from Training Day (2001) film inside vehicle. Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris in driver's seat, wearing dark clothing. Has short hair, thin mustache and goatee, looking toward camera with skeptical questioning expression - eyebrows slightly raised, mouth open mid-speech. Hand visible gesturing. Background shows blurred vehicle interior with gray upholstery, window showing out-of-focus exterior with orange/tan and blue tones suggesting daytime street scene. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THEY TOLD YOU THEY FOUND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in white bold letters: 'AND YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?' References 2016 LIGO announcement of first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, confirming Einstein's century-old prediction. Flat Earth community dismisses gravitational waves as unverifiable theoretical physics rather than empirical science. Uses Denzel Washington's street-smart, skeptical character to question scientific establishment narratives. Training Day scene originally about exposing naivety. Meme suggests mainstream audience credulously accepts scientific announcements without understanding underlying theory or considering alternative explanations. Implies gravitational wave detection could be fabricated data or misinterpreted instrument noise rather than genuine cosmic phenomenon9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-245","title":"Other 245","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688331_461770127356060_1783774617165432927_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-244","title":"Other 244","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688256_462427670623639_8418095521325847670_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-246","title":"Other 246","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697225_465616066971466_1180502624568548152_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
