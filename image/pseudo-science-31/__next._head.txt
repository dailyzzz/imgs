5:T506,Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, stern expression. Top text in large white letters: 'HI, I'M ALBERT MICHELSON, AMERICAN PHYSICIST'. Bottom text: 'MY EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT EARTH DOES NOT ROTATE'. References Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) which attempted to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether by measuring speed of light in different directions. Experiment yielded null result - found no difference in light speed regardless of Earth's motion direction. Meme claims this proves Earth doesn't rotate/move. Misinterpretation: null result didn't prove stationary Earth; instead led to abandonment of aether theory and development of special relativity showing light speed is constant in all reference frames regardless of observer motion. Michelson himself accepted Earth's motion and interpreted results as challenging aether concept, not heliocentrism. Selective presentation of experimental results divorced from actual scientific interpretation and Michelson's own conclusions. Part of pattern citing pre-relativity experiments as proof of geocentrism while ignoring that relativity theory explains these results while maintaining Earth's motion.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 31 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, ste..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pseudo Science 31"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, ste..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46040789_360192281394415_139384281599311872_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 31"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, ste..."}],"$L6"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
