3:T506,Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, stern expression. Top text in large white letters: 'HI, I'M ALBERT MICHELSON, AMERICAN PHYSICIST'. Bottom text: 'MY EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT EARTH DOES NOT ROTATE'. References Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) which attempted to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether by measuring speed of light in different directions. Experiment yielded null result - found no difference in light speed regardless of Earth's motion direction. Meme claims this proves Earth doesn't rotate/move. Misinterpretation: null result didn't prove stationary Earth; instead led to abandonment of aether theory and development of special relativity showing light speed is constant in all reference frames regardless of observer motion. Michelson himself accepted Earth's motion and interpreted results as challenging aether concept, not heliocentrism. Selective presentation of experimental results divorced from actual scientific interpretation and Michelson's own conclusions. Part of pattern citing pre-relativity experiments as proof of geocentrism while ignoring that relativity theory explains these results while maintaining Earth's motion.4:T541,Text-based quote meme with black background and white text. Title: 'Catholic Priest Andrew Pinsent' with subtitle 'Research Director of the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion at Oxford University'. Body text reads: 'Being both a priest and a former particle physicist at CERN, I am often asked to give talks on faith and science. Quite often young people ask me the following question, "How can you be a priest and believe in the Big Bang?" To which I am delighted to respond,' followed by quote: '"We invented it! Or more precisely, Priest Georges Lemaître invented the theory that is today called the 'Big Bang' and everyone should know about him."' Source URL shown: '(http://thesestonewalls.com/gordon-macrae/fr-georges-lemaitre-father-big-bang-2/)' with small colorful logo in bottom right. Emphasizes that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, presenting as point of pride for Catholic Church's contribution to science. Used in various contexts: Catholics cite as evidence of church supporting science; skeptics use to suggest Big Bang is religious doctrine rather than empirical science. Quote demonstrates compatibility of religious faith and scientific work, though Lemaître kept domains separate and his theory was validated through observational evidence regardless of his religious affiliation.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-31","title":"Pseudo Science 31","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46040789_360192281394415_139384281599311872_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-30","title":"Pseudo Science 30","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/41490543_2074782412546446_4904383431149879296_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-32","title":"Pseudo Science 32","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46470458_10212799227198744_2174079361102118912_n-1.jpeg","description":"Two-panel educational meme titled 'Experiments Prove Earth at Rest' showing table with five experiments and their proofs: Airy's Failure (Starlight moves, Telescope remains stationary), Michelson-Morley (No rotation of earth), Michelson-Gale (Aether moves, not earth), Sagnac (Light travels through the aether, No vacuum exists), Bedford Level (Zero curvature in 6 miles of canal) with technical diagrams on right side.
