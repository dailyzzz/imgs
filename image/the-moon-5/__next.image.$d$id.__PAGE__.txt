THAT IS THE FARTHEST WE CAN GO.\"' with attribution '- NASA ASTRONAUT, TERRY VIRTS, 2015'. Right panel shows famous Apollo 11 photograph: astronaut on lunar surface in white spacesuit with gold visor, lunar module and American flag visible in visor reflection, gray moon surface with black space background. Bottom text: 'DO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM HERE?' Presents apparent contradiction between modern astronaut's statement about current spaceflight limitations (Low Earth Orbit only) and claimed 1969 moon landing, questioning how past missions went to moon but present technology cannot leave Earth orbit."},"prevImage":{"id":"the-moon-4","title":"The Moon 4","category":"the-moon","categoryDisplay":"The Moon","src":"/images/gallery/the-moon/42282146_291580768334214_1047718651513274368_n.jpeg","description":"Educational meme titled 'INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED LUMINARY' with yellow text on black background, showing time-lapse photograph of moon's path across night sky. Composite image shows approximately 25 moon phases arranged in arc across dark blue twilight sky above silhouetted mountain range with lit buildings/settlement in valley below. Text reads: 'The idea that this is caused due to a yearly \"wobbly\" of a so called Oblate Pear shaped earth that's hurdling through infinite space is unbelievable. Observing what you see here with logical thinking, it is clear that the Earth is Stationary.' Credit: '© Flat_Earth_Awakening' in bottom right. Argues moon's regular predictable path across sky (lunar arc) is better explained by stationary Earth with moon moving overhead rather than complex wobbling Earth motion through space. Uses visual pattern of lunar phases/positions to support geocentric model."},"nextImage":{"id":"the-moon-6","title":"The Moon 6","category":"the-moon","categoryDisplay":"The Moon","src":"/images/gallery/the-moon/42340574_2229821197295419_3964013763463479296_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'NASA SECRETS' comparing Apollo moon landing photos. Top panel shows classic photograph: astronaut in white spacesuit descending lunar module ladder onto moon surface, gold/bronze colored lunar module with crinkled foil visible, blue Earth rising in black sky background, gray lunar surface. Bottom panel shows same scene in false-color thermal/infrared imaging with vivid neon colors: green ground, bright blue and magenta astronaut figure, yellow-green lunar module. Text overlay: 'OBVIOUS FAKERY! WAKE UP TO APOLLO!' Suggests thermal imaging reveals Apollo photographs were taken in studio with artificial lighting rather than moon's environment, claiming color analysis exposes fakery. Implies temperature/lighting signatures in images are inconsistent with lunar conditions when analyzed through infrared/thermal visualization techniques."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
