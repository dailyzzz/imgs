5:T504,Educational presentation slide titled 'Cavendish History' in large purple text. Content includes bullet points: 'Performed in 1797-1798 by Henry Cavendish', 'Primary result of experiment was to measure the density of the earth' with sub-note '"G" and the mass of the earth were derived by others after Cavendish's death', 'Torsion balance method devised by John Mitchell in 1783' with sub-notes 'Died before experiment could be performed' and 'Apparatus passed eventually to Cavendish, who rebuilt it', 'The apparatus was extremely large, with the heavy lead spheres weighing upwards of 348 lbs'. Right side shows sepia historical photograph of scientist (likely Cavendish) sitting at desk with tall torsion balance apparatus. Bottom left shows technical diagram with caption 'Vertical section drawing of Cavendish's torsion balance instrument including the building in which it was housed. The large balls were hung from a frame so they could be rotated into position next to the small balls by a pulley from outside'. Bottom right notes 'Cavendish performed the experiment inside a closed shed and observed the result from outside through a telescope. The opening in the wall was added by the artist to show the apparatus.' Provides historical context for famous gravity experiment.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 30 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational presentation slide titled 'Cavendish History' in large purple text.
