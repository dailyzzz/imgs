13:T504,Educational presentation slide titled 'Cavendish History' in large purple text. Content includes bullet points: 'Performed in 1797-1798 by Henry Cavendish', 'Primary result of experiment was to measure the density of the earth' with sub-note '"G" and the mass of the earth were derived by others after Cavendish's death', 'Torsion balance method devised by John Mitchell in 1783' with sub-notes 'Died before experiment could be performed' and 'Apparatus passed eventually to Cavendish, who rebuilt it', 'The apparatus was extremely large, with the heavy lead spheres weighing upwards of 348 lbs'. Right side shows sepia historical photograph of scientist (likely Cavendish) sitting at desk with tall torsion balance apparatus. Bottom left shows technical diagram with caption 'Vertical section drawing of Cavendish's torsion balance instrument including the building in which it was housed. The large balls were hung from a frame so they could be rotated into position next to the small balls by a pulley from outside'. Bottom right notes 'Cavendish performed the experiment inside a closed shed and observed the result from outside through a telescope. The opening in the wall was added by the artist to show the apparatus.' Provides historical context for famous gravity experiment.14:T4a4,Educational science diagram titled 'Archimedes Principle' with blue header and white background. Top bullet point defines: 'Archimedes Principle - The buoyant force acting in a substance in a fluid at rest is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the substance.' Shows formula 'Fᵦ = weight of displaced fluid' with red circle highlighting it, followed by 'or' and formula 'Fᵦ = ρ · g · v' with red circle around 'g', annotated with 'THIS FORMULA WAS ADDED MUCH LATER THAN ARCHIMEDES'. Bottom section shows biographical comparison with text 'THEORY OF GRAVITY DIDNT COME OUT UNTIL NEWTON'. Left shows 'Archimedes of Syracuse' with Wikipedia link noting he lived c. 287 - c. 212 BC and was Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Right shows 'Sir Isaac Newton' with PRS link noting he lived December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27 and was English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist. Right side includes diagram of beaker with ice cube showing buoyant force and water displacement. Argues that buoyancy formula containing 'g' (gravity) was added anachronistically after Newton, implying Archimedes' original principle worked without gravity concept.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-30","title":"Gravity 30","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/84094746_619826638592148_2864340146700943360_n.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-29","title":"Gravity 29","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/84049420_619826451925500_1780014471016611840_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-31","title":"Gravity 31","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/Flat-Earth-Memes-417-9.jpeg","description":"Meme with Earth from space showing atmosphere boundary, titled 'THE UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY OF A GAS INSIDE A VACUUM' with questions 'How does gravity know exactly where the atmosphere ends and the vacuum begins?' and 'How can gravity hold a single particle of oxygen at the edge of space against all the power of the vacuum?' with fb.com/aterraeplan watermark"}}]
