I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD SEE THROUGH BUILDINGS, HILLS, MOUNTAINS, 100 FOOT WAVES, DENSE WEATHER, HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS, POLLUTION, FOG, MIST, DUST PARTICLES, DENSE FLUID AIR, ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION AND LENSING, MAGNIFICATION AND SUPERIOR MIRAGE EFFECTS!' Four photographs illustrate atmospheric effects: top left shows hazy city skyline with person's silhouette, top right shows misty mountain layers, bottom left shows snowy landscape barely visible in whiteout conditions, bottom right shows hazy ocean horizon. White text sections: 'OR EVEN EYE-LEVEL HORIZONTAL RATE OF CONVERGENCE AND VANISHING POINT, DEPTH PERCEPTION, RAMPED AND LINEAR PERSPECTIVE, ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND PYRAMIDAL PERSPECTIVE!' and 'OR EVEN KNOWING HOW YOUR EYE VISUAL PERSPECTIVE RAMP ACTUALLY WORKS!' with 'A TRUTH TROOPER' orange logo.

Bottom panel shows black text '(II) We have this substance around us called atmosphere. This includes fog, smog, smoke, etc.... This also limits our view and stops us seeing forever.
