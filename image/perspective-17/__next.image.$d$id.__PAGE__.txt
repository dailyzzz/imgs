Multiple blue mountain silhouettes fade progressively lighter from dark blue/navy in foreground to pale blue in background, demonstrating atmospheric perspective and scattering. White text in center: 'WHY CAN'T YOU SEE FOREVER WITH A TELESCOPE ON A FLAT EARTH? AIR DENSITY AND HUMIDITY. THE FARTHER AWAY YOU ARE FROM A DISTANT OBJECT THE MORE THE AIR AND HUMIDITY OBFUSCATES YOUR VISION OF IT.' Blue text at bottom: 'ONCEYOUGOFLAT.COM'. Argues that atmospheric opacity (air density, humidity, particulates) rather than Earth curvature limits long-distance visibility even with magnification. Visual demonstrates how atmospheric haze progressively obscures distant objects through light scattering and absorption."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-16","title":"Perspective 16","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/37081868_10161436232905354_3629411853777502208_n.jpeg","description":"Scenic photograph of wooden pier or dock extending over turquoise tropical waters toward horizon, overlaid with perspective grid lines. Orange-brown wooden boardwalk with posts on both sides runs toward vanishing point in center. Calm shallow water in shades of turquoise and aqua surrounds pier. Blue sky with white clouds at top. Gray and green perspective grid lines overlay entire image showing nested rectangular frames converging toward vanishing point, with diagonal lines radiating from center. Green convergence lines emphasize vanishing point principle. Small 'AEW' watermark in lower left. Demonstrates linear perspective where parallel lines (pier edges, railings) converge to single point at horizon, fundamental principle used in art and photography. Illustrates how three-dimensional space is perceived on two-dimensional plane."},"nextImage":{"id":"perspective-18","title":"Perspective 18","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/37145083_10160681832370626_2436396095023087616_n.jpeg","description":"Interior photograph of long hotel or institutional corridor demonstrating linear perspective. Cream/beige walls with white chair rail molding line both sides. Red-orange patterned carpet runner extends down center toward vanishing point. Dark wooden doors with room numbers visible on left side. Wall sconces with white lampshades provide warm lighting at regular intervals on both walls. Ceiling with recessed lighting recedes toward distant end point. All parallel lines (walls, carpet edges, ceiling lines, floor baseboards) converge toward single vanishing point at far end of hallway, creating strong sense of depth and distance. Classic example of one-point linear perspective in architectural photography. Slightly blurred/motion effect suggests movement or time-lapse quality."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
