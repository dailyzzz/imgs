Blue represents oceans, green/tan/orange represents continents. Thousands of white lines crisscross map showing flight paths or connections between locations, creating dense web pattern concentrated in Northern Hemisphere with fewer connections to Southern Hemisphere. Heavy concentration of routes between North America, Europe, and Asia. Bottom credit '©Ashlee Filopard Webster'. Azimuthal equidistant projection preserves distances from center point, making it useful for aviation and radio communication but creates distortions at edges.
