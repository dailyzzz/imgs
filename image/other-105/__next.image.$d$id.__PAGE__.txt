3:T43a,Two-panel demonstration about centrifugal force with water in rotating container. Top header states 'Water in a rotating container forms a parabolic shape (due to the centrifugal force).' Left panel shows clear rectangular aquarium with bright blue water sitting level on black rotating platform (lazy Susan) in classroom/lab setting with beige walls and doorway visible. Water surface perfectly flat and horizontal. Right panel shows same setup during rotation with hands visible holding edges, water surface now curved upward forming parabolic/concave shape due to centrifugal force pushing water outward against container walls. Text 'Flat Earth Matters' visible on right panel. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Large text asks 'WHERE'S THIS CENTRIPETAL FORCE?' Questions why oceans don't form parabolic shape if Earth rotates. Demonstrates that rotating containers create observable water curvature via centrifugal force, yet Earth's oceans remain level, suggesting Earth doesn't rotate. Challenges rotating Earth model by comparing to demonstrable physics of spinning water0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-105","title":"Other 105","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10268717_474792612720478_2806422081768567871_n.jpg","description":"Azimuthal equidistant projection map visualization showing global flight path network. Circular map centered on North Pole with π (pi) symbol in center. Concentric rings mark hours (//1, //2, etc. up to //9) radiating outward. Blue represents oceans, green/tan/orange represents continents. Thousands of white lines crisscross map showing flight paths or connections between locations, creating dense web pattern concentrated in Northern Hemisphere with fewer connections to Southern Hemisphere. Heavy concentration of routes between North America, Europe, and Asia. Bottom credit '©Ashlee Filopard Webster'. Azimuthal equidistant projection preserves distances from center point, making it useful for aviation and radio communication but creates distortions at edges. In flat Earth discourse, this projection is sometimes presented as actual Earth map showing true flight paths, though it's mathematical projection of spherical Earth onto flat surface"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-104","title":"Other 104","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10268542_478092492390490_6265896696620327663_n.jpg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme contrasting flat Earth vs globe Earth scientific methodology. Top panel labeled 'Science on the Flat earth' shows two scientists in white lab coats and safety goggles conducting laboratory experiment with glassware containing colorful liquids (beaker with purple liquid, test tube with orange liquid), microscope visible in background, professional laboratory setting. Bottom panel labeled 'Science on the globe' shows hands using calculator with person wearing glasses looking at camera, calculator display visible showing numbers.
