3:T551,Apollo moon landing photograph with 'GOT STARS?' caption questioning missing stars. Shows iconic Apollo mission imagery against pure black space background. Top third displays large white bold text: 'GOT STARS?' Center shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph - blue and white Earth partially visible rising above lunar horizon, showing cloud patterns, blue oceans, white swirls of atmosphere. Earth appears as half-sphere floating in black space. Lower half shows gray lunar surface with Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on moon's surface. LM has distinctive gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, angular geometric shape with four landing legs/struts visible. American flag planted in lunar soil left of LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible near module. Scientific instruments and equipment scattered on gray regolith. Surface shows typical lunar dust, craters, rocks. Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skeptics frequently point to complete absence of stars in Apollo photographs as evidence of studio fakery. Argue space should show millions of stars against black void, but photos show pure black sky. NASA explains this as camera exposure settings - bright sunlight reflecting off lunar surface and spacesuits required fast shutter speeds and small apertures, making dim stars invisible just as stars aren't visible in daytime Earth photography4:T556,Young woman graduate holding globe with George Orwell educational indoctrination quote. Shows graduate in black cap and gown wearing traditional mortarboard with tassel hanging left side. Holds colorful desktop globe showing blue oceans, tan/green continents, light pink/purple landmasses. Background is light blue/teal gradient. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Bottom features George Orwell quote in white text: 'THE FURTHER A SOCIETY DRIFTS FROM THE TRUTH, THE MORE IT WILL HATE THOSE WHO SPEAK IT. ~GEORGE ORWELL'. Bottom left corner watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Image argues that public education systems indoctrinate students with globe Earth model through repetition and authority rather than independent investigation. Cites Orwell (author of 1984) to suggest mainstream education is propaganda apparatus suppressing truth. Implies questioning institutional knowledge leads to social ostracism. Globe in graduate's hands symbolizes educational system literally putting worldview into students' possession without critical examination. Common flat Earth argument that people believe in globe Earth not because they've personally verified it, but because teachers, textbooks, and authority figures repeated it throughout childhood when critical thinking skills were undeveloped5:T50c,Perspective challenge meme with upside-down cliff face and sailboats. Shows dramatic photo manipulation creating disorienting visual effect. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'YOU SAY I'M CRAZY'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU THINK THIS IS REALITY'. Center shows person in blue denim jacket, gray pants, light brown/tan hat standing on edge of rocky cliff or mountainside. Person viewed from behind, hands on hips, looking outward. Sky appears as bright blue with single white puffy cloud on left side. Most striking element: massive rock face/cliff appears inverted - hangs upside-down from 'sky', creating impossible geometry. Rocky surface shows layered sedimentary strata, brown-gray-tan colors. Right side of inverted cliff face shows approximately 20 sailboats with white sails, all appearing to sail vertically up the rock surface as if gravity doesn't exist. Ocean or water body appears turquoise-blue. Some green vegetation/grass visible. Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right: 'JM' logo. Image uses visual paradox to argue mainstream worldview is equally nonsensical as this impossible scene. Suggests people accept absurd propositions (spinning ball Earth, gravity, orbital mechanics) just as absurd as upside-down mountains with vertical sailing0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-197","title":"Other 197","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12565566_456985911167815_7506546729553344199_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-196","title":"Other 196","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12565438_459893394210400_9196660274753455592_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-198","title":"Other 198","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12573056_457572907775782_3833056125230467759_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
