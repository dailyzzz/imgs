5:T551,Apollo moon landing photograph with 'GOT STARS?' caption questioning missing stars. Shows iconic Apollo mission imagery against pure black space background. Top third displays large white bold text: 'GOT STARS?' Center shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph - blue and white Earth partially visible rising above lunar horizon, showing cloud patterns, blue oceans, white swirls of atmosphere. Earth appears as half-sphere floating in black space. Lower half shows gray lunar surface with Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on moon's surface. LM has distinctive gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, angular geometric shape with four landing legs/struts visible. American flag planted in lunar soil left of LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible near module. Scientific instruments and equipment scattered on gray regolith. Surface shows typical lunar dust, craters, rocks. Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skeptics frequently point to complete absence of stars in Apollo photographs as evidence of studio fakery. Argue space should show millions of stars against black void, but photos show pure black sky. NASA explains this as camera exposure settings - bright sunlight reflecting off lunar surface and spacesuits required fast shutter speeds and small apertures, making dim stars invisible just as stars aren't visible in daytime Earth photography0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 197 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo moon landing photograph with 'GOT STARS?' caption questioning missing stars.
