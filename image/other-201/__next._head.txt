Title in bold capitals: 'THE RED SHIFT HYPOTHESIS FOR QUASARS: IS THE EARTH THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE?' Author listed as 'Y. P. VARSHNI' from 'Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Canada'. Date stamp '(Received 10 September, 1975)' below author. Abstract section discusses cosmological interpretation of quasar redshift spectra leading to paradoxical result that Earth is center of Universe. Text mentions Einstein's criteria for good theory - external confirmation and inner perfection or 'logical simplicity' or 'naturalness'. Quote attributed to 'G. Holton (1973)'. Main body discusses G. Burbidge (1968) pointing out absorption-line red shifts at specific values (1.95, 1.55). Mentions four quasars (Ton 153, PKS 0119-04, PHL 938, 3C 232) whose emission-line red shifts cluster around 1.955. Discusses probability calculations for chance coincidence of four emission-line red shifts at 1.955. Includes mathematical equation labeled (1) for probability calculation.
