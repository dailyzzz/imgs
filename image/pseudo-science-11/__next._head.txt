5:T421,Quote meme showing black and white photograph of Michelson-Morley interferometer apparatus - large stone/concrete experimental platform with precise measurement instruments and American flag visible in background brick building. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'The data [of Michelson-Morley] were almost unbelievable... There was only one other possible conclusion to draw — that the Earth was at rest.' Attribution: '• PHYSICIST, BERNARD JAFFE •' followed by hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. References famous 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempting to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether, which yielded null result. Quote suggests experiment proved stationary Earth, though actual scientific interpretation led to special relativity theory and abandonment of aether concept, not geocentrism. Selective quote mining presenting null result as evidence for stationary Earth rather than indicating aether doesn't exist and light speed is constant regardless of reference frame motion.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 11 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Quote meme showing black and white photograph of Michelson-Morley interferometer apparatus - large stone/concrete experimental platform with precise measurem..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pseudo Science 11"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Quote meme showing black and white photograph of Michelson-Morley interferometer apparatus - large stone/concrete experimental platform with precise measurem..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396756_247796012375212_5306635309299996008_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 11"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Quote meme showing black and white photograph of Michelson-Morley interferometer apparatus - large stone/concrete experimental platform with precise measurem..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396756_247796012375212_5306635309299996008_n.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
