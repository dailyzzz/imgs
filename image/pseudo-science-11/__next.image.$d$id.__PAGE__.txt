3:T421,Quote meme showing black and white photograph of Michelson-Morley interferometer apparatus - large stone/concrete experimental platform with precise measurement instruments and American flag visible in background brick building. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'The data [of Michelson-Morley] were almost unbelievable... There was only one other possible conclusion to draw — that the Earth was at rest.' Attribution: '• PHYSICIST, BERNARD JAFFE •' followed by hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. References famous 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempting to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether, which yielded null result. Quote suggests experiment proved stationary Earth, though actual scientific interpretation led to special relativity theory and abandonment of aether concept, not geocentrism. Selective quote mining presenting null result as evidence for stationary Earth rather than indicating aether doesn't exist and light speed is constant regardless of reference frame motion.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-11","title":"Pseudo Science 11","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396756_247796012375212_5306635309299996008_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-10","title":"Pseudo Science 10","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19260679_247795962375217_711734426133789066_n.jpeg","description":"Quote meme with portrait of Carl Sagan in red turtleneck sweater against blurred galaxy/space background.

Quote suggests that despite accepting heliocentric model intellectually, humans intuitively maintain geocentric (Earth-centered) worldview in daily experience and perception. Presented out of context to imply even prominent scientists like Carl Sagan acknowledged problems with heliocentric model, though actual quote likely refers to psychological/perceptual human tendency to experience Earth as stationary center, not rejection of heliocentrism.

Quote from Hendrik Lorentz (Dutch physicist who developed Lorentz transformations used in special relativity) discussing how physical observations from Earth's reference frame appear consistent with stationary Earth. Quote taken out of context - Lorentz was discussing reference frame equivalence and transformation equations that allow calculations from Earth's perspective while accepting Earth's actual motion. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's statement about mathematical reference frames as admission of geocentrism, though Lorentz accepted heliocentric model and his work underlies modern relativity theory."}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
