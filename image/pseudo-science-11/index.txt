Quote suggests that despite accepting heliocentric model intellectually, humans intuitively maintain geocentric (Earth-centered) worldview in daily experience and perception.

Quote from Hendrik Lorentz (Dutch physicist who developed Lorentz transformations used in special relativity) discussing how physical observations from Earth's reference frame appear consistent with stationary Earth. Quote taken out of context - Lorentz was discussing reference frame equivalence and transformation equations that allow calculations from Earth's perspective while accepting Earth's actual motion. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's statement about mathematical reference frames as admission of geocentrism, though Lorentz accepted heliocentric model and his work underlies modern relativity theory."}}]
