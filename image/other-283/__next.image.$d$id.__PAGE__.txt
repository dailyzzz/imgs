3:T79d,Flat Earth cosmology sun diagram with colored orbital circles. Minimalist educational diagram showing sun in flat Earth model with symbolic colored circles. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Central illustration on solid black background shows large pale yellow-cream circle representing sun in center. Sun rendered as perfect sphere with subtle gradient from bright yellow-white at center to slightly darker cream at edges suggesting luminosity. Around central sun positioned six smaller solid-colored circles arranged roughly in circular pattern but not perfectly symmetrical: Upper center shows deep blue/navy circle. Upper left shows teal/cyan circle. Left side shows forest green circle. Lower center shows bright yellow circle (slightly smaller than sun but similar color). Right side shows orange-amber circle. Upper right shows dark red/maroon circle. Circles appear to float in space around sun on black background. No connecting lines, orbits, labels, or explanatory text visible besides title. Spacing between circles irregular - not precise orbital diagram. Bottom text on beige border: 'THE SUN'. Minimalist aesthetic with vintage poster feel from beige border and simple color palette. Diagram purpose unclear without labels - colored circles might represent: 1) Planets in flat Earth model orbiting sun (though flat Earth models typically have sun orbiting above Earth plane, not other planets orbiting sun), 2) Different wavelengths/colors of light emitted by sun (but why only 6 discrete colors?), 3) Symbolic representation of sun's influence or energy at different positions, 4) Purely decorative artistic interpretation. Standard flat Earth cosmology has small local sun (32-50 miles diameter, 3000-5000 miles altitude) circling above stationary Earth plane creating day/night through proximity/distance. This diagram's meaning ambiguous without context. Artistic style mimics vintage scientific illustrations4:T825,Flat Earth cosmology azimuthal equidistant projection labeled as United Nations map. Artistic rendering of world map using azimuthal equidistant projection viewed from North Pole perspective. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central image shows circular map on light background (appears like marble or textured white surface) surrounded by thin black double-line border frame. Map displays Earth's continents arranged radially from center point (North Pole shown as white circle with radiating lines). Continents shown in natural colors: green for vegetation/landmasses, tan/beige for deserts, white for ice/snow (Antarctica and Greenland). Oceans in gradient turquoise-teal-blue getting darker toward outer edge. North Pole at dead center with Arctic Ocean and Greenland visible. Moving outward clockwise from top: Asia (Russia, China, Japan visible in tan-green), Africa (shown in tan-brown tones), Europe (small green landmass), North America (green, stretching along right side), South America (green-tan on lower right), Australia (visible as isolated landmass in green-tan), various Pacific islands scattered throughout ocean. Concentric circles and radial lines create latitude/longitude grid system. Small yellow dots appear at regular intervals around continents possibly representing cities or coordinate markers. Map edges fade into lighter background suggesting atmosphere or boundary. Bottom text on beige border: 'UNITED NATIONS MAP'. Projection is legitimate cartographic tool (official UN emblem uses it) designed to show accurate distances from center point - useful for radio communications, aviation planning from specific location. However, severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center. Antarctica appears as ring around entire perimeter (in reality it's continent smaller than South America). Australia and South America appear enormous. This projection does NOT prove flat Earth - it's mathematical transformation of spherical surface to 2D plane, like Mercator projection. All map projections involve distortion trade-offs5:T847,Dog nose versus black holes comparison mocking LIGO gravitational wave detection. Satirical image comparing LIGO's gravitational wave detection visualization to dog nose photograph. Image split into three sections. Top section shows close-up photograph of dog's nose in black and white - two nostrils appear as dark holes separated by median groove, textured wet skin around nostrils with visible pores and bumpy surface typical of canine rhinarium. Top text in white typewriter-style font: '2 Black holes...??? Or Dog nose...!!!' with multiple question marks and exclamation points suggesting skepticism. Middle section shows quote in white text: '"By the way, this is not a Hollywood production that I am going to show you..."' appears to be quote from scientist discussing LIGO detection. Text suggests speaker emphasizing authenticity of upcoming image. News ticker visible showing 'Sky NEWS' logo, time stamp 'LIVE 10:37', stock price '5590.36'. Bottom section displays LIGO's famous gravitational wave visualization - computer-generated image showing two dark circular regions (black holes) creating warped spacetime effect on dark gray/brown granular background resembling gravel or cosmic dust. Visualization shows merger of two black holes with distortion patterns radiating outward. Large white text overlaid: 'NASA LIES'. Below: 'Research your Flat and Stationary Earth'. Bottom news banner: 'SPACE BREAKTHROUGH' with red background, white text explaining 'THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WAS FIRST PREDICTED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN A CENTURY' and additional scrolling text about Jeremy Corbyn and junior doctors. Attribution: 'Karlee Sunshine Midreno'. Meme mocks resemblance between dog nose and LIGO visualization suggesting detection image is fake or dog nose. However, similarity is superficial - LIGO image shows computer simulation of spacetime curvature from actual interferometer data detecting ripples from black hole merger 1.3 billion light-years away. Detection confirmed Einstein's century-old prediction, won Nobel Prize. Visual similarity to dog nose doesn't invalidate scientific measurement0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-283","title":"Other 283","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729356_464902073709532_6940837958255985229_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-282","title":"Other 282","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729232_464902337042839_4150015327768630377_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-284","title":"Other 284","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12733513_463978993801840_1494230350043442241_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
