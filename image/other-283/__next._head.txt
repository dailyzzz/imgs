5:T79d,Flat Earth cosmology sun diagram with colored orbital circles. Minimalist educational diagram showing sun in flat Earth model with symbolic colored circles. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Central illustration on solid black background shows large pale yellow-cream circle representing sun in center. Sun rendered as perfect sphere with subtle gradient from bright yellow-white at center to slightly darker cream at edges suggesting luminosity. Around central sun positioned six smaller solid-colored circles arranged roughly in circular pattern but not perfectly symmetrical: Upper center shows deep blue/navy circle. Upper left shows teal/cyan circle. Left side shows forest green circle. Lower center shows bright yellow circle (slightly smaller than sun but similar color). Right side shows orange-amber circle. Upper right shows dark red/maroon circle. Circles appear to float in space around sun on black background. No connecting lines, orbits, labels, or explanatory text visible besides title. Spacing between circles irregular - not precise orbital diagram. Bottom text on beige border: 'THE SUN'. Minimalist aesthetic with vintage poster feel from beige border and simple color palette. Diagram purpose unclear without labels - colored circles might represent: 1) Planets in flat Earth model orbiting sun (though flat Earth models typically have sun orbiting above Earth plane, not other planets orbiting sun), 2) Different wavelengths/colors of light emitted by sun (but why only 6 discrete colors?), 3) Symbolic representation of sun's influence or energy at different positions, 4) Purely decorative artistic interpretation. Standard flat Earth cosmology has small local sun (32-50 miles diameter, 3000-5000 miles altitude) circling above stationary Earth plane creating day/night through proximity/distance. This diagram's meaning ambiguous without context. Artistic style mimics vintage scientific illustrations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 283 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth cosmology sun diagram with colored orbital circles.
