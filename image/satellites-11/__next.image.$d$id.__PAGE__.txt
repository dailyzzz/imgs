Top panel shows astronaut in white spacesuit with gold-tinted visor working on equipment, visible blue water/pool background suggesting underwater training. Bottom panel shows same or similar scene with black space background instead of blue water. Both show astronaut with detailed spacesuit, helmet, life support equipment, and ISS/spacecraft components. White horizontal dividing line separates panels. Suggests spacewalk footage may be filmed underwater in Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory training pool rather than actual space, with background digitally altered from blue water to black space in post-production. Questions authenticity of space imagery by comparing training simulation to released footage."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-10","title":"Satellites 10","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45563354_2122322494472923_829028833880440832_n.jpeg","description":"Conspiracy theory infographic about Kenneth Kleinknect showing portrait of older man in formal Masonic regalia with ornate collar chain and medallion. Top text: 'Kenneth Kleinknect - NASA 22 yrs. Departing NASA in 1981 to work for Lockheed Martin.' Followed by text describing his Masonic role: 'Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States for 56 years, 18 of them as its Grand Secretary and the final 18 as Sovereign Grand Commander of this oldest of the world's Scottish Rite governing bodies.' Red arrow points to cross-like Masonic symbol with text 'WORSHIPS SATAN' and yellow text 'Chief of Apollo Program' with blue text 'GO NASA'. Middle row shows five variations of similar geometric cross/grid symbols, including circular 'ORDO BAPHOMETIS' seal. Bottom shows larger cross symbol with cursive 'Baphomet' signature. Silhouette of horned figure in corner. Alleges NASA Apollo program leadership had satanic Masonic connections."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-12","title":"Satellites 12","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45761066_2230561903642460_4172780136468316160_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison of satellite technology. Left panel shows workers in yellow and black safety vests on elevated platform working on white satellite equipment labeled 'WORLD VIEW' with American flag and red dot pattern visible at sunset/dusk. Right panel shows black and white aerial/satellite photograph of approximately 13-15 large circular structures (possibly storage tanks or satellite ground equipment) arranged in cluster pattern over rural farmland with roads and field boundaries visible. Suggests satellite ground infrastructure or alternative high-altitude platform technology (World View stratospheric balloon system) rather than orbital satellites. World View Enterprises operates high-altitude balloon platforms for observation, potentially presented as evidence that 'satellites' are actually ground or stratospheric-based systems."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
