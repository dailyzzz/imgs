5:T766,Flat Earth edge composite arguing space having no edge proves Earth must have edge. Elaborate digital composite artwork comparing concept of infinite space versus finite flat Earth using false dichotomy reasoning. Upper left quadrant depicts flat Earth cosmology - massive ice cliff/wall representing Antarctica as boundary. Ice wall appears as vertical cliff face hundreds of feet tall showing layered compressed ice with blue-white coloring, cracks, crevasses. Standing on top are several human figures - hikers/explorers with backpacks. Central figure stands at very edge peering over. Scale suggests ice wall is enormous - humans appear tiny. Above shows realistic sky with blue color and white cumulus clouds. Lower right quadrant shows deep space - black void filled with stars creating typical night sky. Blue nebula clouds visible creating cosmic gas formations. Small portion shows spherical Earth in lower corner showing blue oceans, clouds, landmasses as it would appear from space. Earth's presence creates ironic contradiction with flat Earth section. Central element: massive chasm/void separating sections - appears as if ice cliff drops into infinite space below. Two figures at base appearing to peer upward. Attribution "DDees.com" and "fb.com/fematters" visible. Text overlays: Top reads "IF SPACE DOESN'T HAVE AN EDGE" setting up premise. Bottom reads "WHY ASSUME THAT FLAT EARTH DOES?" Argument employs false dichotomy: because space doesn't have edge, Earth shouldn't either. However, Earth and space/universe are different categories - Earth is planetary body with measurable dimensions, space is all of existence. We can verify Earth doesn't have edge by circumnavigation - people travel around world continuously returning to start. Antarctic ice wall misrepresents Antarctica - actual continent surrounded by ocean, extensively mapped with permanent research stations.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 355 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth edge composite arguing space having no edge proves Earth must have edge.
