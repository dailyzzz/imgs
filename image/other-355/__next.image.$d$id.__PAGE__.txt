3:T766,Flat Earth edge composite arguing space having no edge proves Earth must have edge. Elaborate digital composite artwork comparing concept of infinite space versus finite flat Earth using false dichotomy reasoning. Upper left quadrant depicts flat Earth cosmology - massive ice cliff/wall representing Antarctica as boundary. Ice wall appears as vertical cliff face hundreds of feet tall showing layered compressed ice with blue-white coloring, cracks, crevasses. Standing on top are several human figures - hikers/explorers with backpacks. Central figure stands at very edge peering over. Scale suggests ice wall is enormous - humans appear tiny. Above shows realistic sky with blue color and white cumulus clouds. Lower right quadrant shows deep space - black void filled with stars creating typical night sky. Blue nebula clouds visible creating cosmic gas formations. Small portion shows spherical Earth in lower corner showing blue oceans, clouds, landmasses as it would appear from space. Earth's presence creates ironic contradiction with flat Earth section. Central element: massive chasm/void separating sections - appears as if ice cliff drops into infinite space below. Two figures at base appearing to peer upward. Attribution "DDees.com" and "fb.com/fematters" visible. Text overlays: Top reads "IF SPACE DOESN'T HAVE AN EDGE" setting up premise. Bottom reads "WHY ASSUME THAT FLAT EARTH DOES?" Argument employs false dichotomy: because space doesn't have edge, Earth shouldn't either. However, Earth and space/universe are different categories - Earth is planetary body with measurable dimensions, space is all of existence. We can verify Earth doesn't have edge by circumnavigation - people travel around world continuously returning to start. Antarctic ice wall misrepresents Antarctica - actual continent surrounded by ocean, extensively mapped with permanent research stations.4:T867,Sand dunes with world map overlay promoting flat Earth research activism. Photograph of desert sand dunes with digitally composited world map creating visual metaphor about reshaping understanding of Earth's geography. Image shows natural desert landscape - rolling sand dunes creating organic wave-like patterns across terrain. Sand appears light tan/beige color showing fine texture with wind-created ripple patterns (aeolian bedforms) covering dune surfaces. Ripples create parallel wavy lines following contours of dunes, showing characteristic small-scale patterns formed by wind action on loose sand. Foreground shows prominent dune with steep face and sharp crest line. Multiple dunes visible receding into background creating layered composition with atmospheric perspective. Dune grass or beach grass grows from sand - green-yellow vegetation clumps scattered across dunes providing contrast to tan sand. Several prominent grass clumps in foreground showing detail of individual blades. Background shows misty/foggy conditions - mountains or hills barely visible through haze. Sky shows overcast conditions with white-gray clouds creating diffused lighting. Digitally added element: Center-lower portion displays flat world map projection superimposed onto sand surface. Map shows continents in medium blue/teal color contrasting with tan sand. Continents include North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia rendered as solid blue shapes. Map integrated into sand texture maintaining ripple patterns visible through semi-transparent continents. Text overlays in large bold white letters: Top text reads "RESEARCH FLAT EARTH" - direct call to action. Bottom text reads "BECAUSE IT MATTERS" - emphasizing importance. Upper left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Message positioning flat Earth research as important activism. Map's presence on shifting sand suggests current understanding is unstable as sand dunes, can be reshaped. However, phrase "because it matters" begs question: why does Earth's shape matter more than accurate understanding based on evidence? Scientific method values truth regardless of preference.5:T6fb,Apollo moon landing photograph with visible film set equipment suggesting studio hoax. Composite image showing Apollo moon photograph with digitally added elements (ceiling, lighting equipment, wires) to suggest scene filmed in studio. Main image shows famous Apollo photograph - lunar surface with gray regolith showing texture with rocks, craters scattered across. Left shows ALSEP scientific equipment with gold/bronze thermal blankets. Center shows Apollo astronaut in white EVA spacesuit with PLSS backpack, gold-tinted sun visor, American flag patch, working on surface. Sharp black shadows indicating single light source in airless environment. Left foreground shows American flag planted in surface appearing extended (horizontal rod keeps it extended in vacuum). DIGITALLY ADDED: Top shows film studio ceiling - wooden rafters creating grid pattern, yellowish-tan coloring. Three vertical wires/cables hanging toward astronaut suggesting wire suspension. Two crew members visible on elevated platform near ceiling. Lighting equipment visible. Addition creates impression photograph is film set with suspended actor. Text overlays: Top reads "IT'S EASIER TO FOOL PEOPLE". Bottom reads "THAN TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOOLED" - quote suggesting psychological resistance to admitting deception. Right shows "fb.com/fematters". Represents moon landing hoax theory. However, extensive evidence confirms landings were real: retroreflectors on moon still used today, LRO photographed landing sites, 842 pounds lunar rocks with characteristics impossible to fake, Soviet Union confirmed landings, thousands involved making conspiracy implausible, independent tracking confirmed transmissions from lunar vicinity, physics in footage impossible to replicate with 1960s effects.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-355","title":"Other 355","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814403_474986176034455_598040337757001983_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-354","title":"Other 354","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814205_474135472786192_8060687104393640406_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-356","title":"Other 356","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814441_475043012695438_7139502113511027053_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
