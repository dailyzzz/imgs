3:T451,Three-part comparison meme contrasting heliocentric CGI with flat Earth sun model. Top section shows CGI planetary size comparison with text 'This CGI image destroys the Heliocentric model of a massive Sun 93 million miles away'. Large yellow sun sphere shown with Jupiter, Saturn, and smaller planets in row below with downward arrow. Blue text on sun reads 'IF THE SUN WERE ACTUALLY THIS MASSIVE AND ITS LIGHT COMING FROM THAT FAR AWAY, A SIMPLE 23° TILT OF EARTH WOULD BE INSIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THIS SCALE, AND THERE WOULD NOT EVEN BE THE SLIGHTEST TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION AROUND THIS TINY SPEC OF A PEBBLE YOU CALL EARTH'. Middle section labeled 'This is a REAL photo of the small local Sun above the Flat Earth' shows bright star-like point source with lens flare/rays against dark blue background. Bottom shows text 'Sun Hotspot' in red with arrow pointing to bright spot on flat blue surface with gradient. Caption 'Demonstrating how we have seasons and temperat fluctuation across Earth'. Argues massive distant sun cannot create seasons via 23° tilt, but small local sun creating hotspot can4:T551,Educational meme about inverse-square law titled 'INVERSE-SQUARE LAW' with yellow borders. Top left explains: 'As light radiates from a point source, the intensity of light (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) from the source. I ~ (1/r²)' followed by 'As intensity is the power per unit area (W/m²), it naturally decreases with the square of the distance as the size of the radiative spherical wavefront increases with distance.' Includes diagram showing light rays spreading from point source through expanding grid frames illustrating inverse-square relationship. Top right shows photograph of person with flashlight in dark forest, beam creating bright cone of light with intensity decreasing with distance. Bottom row shows four sunset photographs labeled 'THE SUN', 'IS NOT', '93 MILLION', 'MILES AWAY' featuring dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through clouds in various configurations. Bottom left shows day/night side-by-side comparison. Large bottom section shows row of light bulbs at increasing distances (6in/15cm through 48in/122cm) demonstrating light intensity falloff. Bottom text 'ALL LIGHT HAS RANGE'. Argues visible light intensity falloff in flashlight and sunset rays proves sun must be local/nearby rather than 93 million miles away, applying inverse-square law to challenge astronomical distances0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-34","title":"The Sun 34","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/45823317_10216085286676552_4650631716715626496_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-33","title":"The Sun 33","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/44422190_1946385932149172_1826894120656830464_n.jpeg","description":"Two-part meme questioning why we don't see walls of light if sun is 93 million miles away. Top section shows gradient background from yellow (left) to orange/black (right) with bright yellow sun rays emanating from left side. Text reads 'IF THE SUN IS 93 MILLION MILES AWAY AND THE LIGHT TRAVELS THE WHOLE DISTANCE'. Small Earth sphere shown on right with long black shadow cone extending rightward. Bottom section states 'DOESN'T THE LIGHT TRAVEL PAST EARTH ALSO AND WOULDN'T WE SEE WALLS OF LIGHT 360° AROUND OUR NIGHT HORIZON?' Questions why night sky is dark if sunlight travels past Earth continuously. Argues that if sun's light travels 93 million miles to reach Earth, light should continue past Earth illuminating space behind it, creating visible light walls around entire night horizon.
