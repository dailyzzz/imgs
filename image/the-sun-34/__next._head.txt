5:T451,Three-part comparison meme contrasting heliocentric CGI with flat Earth sun model. Top section shows CGI planetary size comparison with text 'This CGI image destroys the Heliocentric model of a massive Sun 93 million miles away'. Large yellow sun sphere shown with Jupiter, Saturn, and smaller planets in row below with downward arrow. Blue text on sun reads 'IF THE SUN WERE ACTUALLY THIS MASSIVE AND ITS LIGHT COMING FROM THAT FAR AWAY, A SIMPLE 23° TILT OF EARTH WOULD BE INSIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THIS SCALE, AND THERE WOULD NOT EVEN BE THE SLIGHTEST TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION AROUND THIS TINY SPEC OF A PEBBLE YOU CALL EARTH'. Middle section labeled 'This is a REAL photo of the small local Sun above the Flat Earth' shows bright star-like point source with lens flare/rays against dark blue background. Bottom shows text 'Sun Hotspot' in red with arrow pointing to bright spot on flat blue surface with gradient. Caption 'Demonstrating how we have seasons and temperat fluctuation across Earth'. Argues massive distant sun cannot create seasons via 23° tilt, but small local sun creating hotspot can0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Sun 34 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Three-part comparison meme contrasting heliocentric CGI with flat Earth sun model.
