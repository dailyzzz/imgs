Why doesn't the atmosphere get sucked into it?' '2. Why don't satellites or the ISS get sucked in?' '3. Why do you say wind is caused by air pressure? Especially if space is a vacuum?' '4. If you are already in a vacuum, why do you need to escape it?' '5. When you're already supposed to be in space?' '6. Why isn't a level, level?' Questions mainstream astronomy model regarding atmosphere retention in vacuum of space, satellite mechanics, atmospheric pressure physics, and concept of escaping atmosphere when space is already vacuum. Conflates multiple scientific concepts: atmospheric retention via gravity, pressure gradients, orbital mechanics, and definition of 'space' boundary"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-9","title":"The Sun 9","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/18485938_424147741275342_6268753908468720580_n.jpeg","description":"Six-panel educational meme demonstrating perspective principles using coin and sunset comparison. Top row shows three images of coin on flat surface: close-up showing full circular coin (labeled '1'), medium distance showing coin appearing partially below surface edge (labeled '2'), far distance showing only top edge visible (labeled '3'). Bottom row shows three corresponding sunset photographs over water horizon: sun fully above horizon (labeled '4'), sun partially below horizon (labeled '5'), sun barely visible as sliver at horizon (labeled '6'). Bottom text reads 'THE SUN IS NOT GOING DOWN, IT IS ONLY GOING AWAY FROM YOU!' Presents perspective explanation for sunset: sun appears to descend below horizon not due to Earth's rotation but because object moving away on flat plane appears to lower and eventually disappear at vanishing point, comparing sunset to coin demonstration where distance creates appearance of descent"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-11","title":"The Sun 11","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/20258399_1416599365044078_5035741180096448309_n.jpeg","description":"Meme titled 'CONSISTENCY' with emoji decorations showing historical inconsistency in scientific estimates of sun's distance. Header reads 'The EXACT SCIENCE!' with subtitle 'Sun's distance from Earth-' followed by chronological list of astronomers' estimates in large red text: Copernicus 3 million miles, Tycho Brahe 13 million miles, Kepler 13 million miles, Newton 28 million miles, Newton (2nd attempt) 54 million miles, Martin 1754 81/82 million miles, Encke 1869 95.274.000 million miles, Mleyer 104 million miles, R.Ball 92/93 million miles. Bottom text emphasizes 'only 100 million miles difference!' with underlining. Argues that dramatic variations in historical measurements (ranging from 3 to 104 million miles) demonstrate fundamental inconsistency in scientific method and casts doubt on current accepted value of 93 million miles.
