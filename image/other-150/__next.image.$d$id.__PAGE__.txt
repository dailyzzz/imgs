3:T527,Artistic cross-section sculpture demonstrating water's properties with text overlay. Shows gray neutral background. Sculpture appears to be concrete or stone cut away to reveal transparent turquoise/teal resin or glass representing water inside. Gray concrete/stone forms irregular container with curved bottom surface and architectural features like arched opening/window. Transparent blue-green material fills container showing water conforming to shape with realistic surface tension - small ripples and waves visible at top surface suggesting movement. Vertical striations in transparent material create realistic water texture. Small cylindrical brown object (possibly lighthouse or post) protrudes from top of structure. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER TAKES THE SHAPE OF ITS RECEPTACLE AND FINDS ITS LEVEL'. Bottom text: 'AND IT FLOWS OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES KEEPING IT IN'. Right side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Demonstrates fundamental properties of water - conforming to container shape and seeking level surface. Argues if Earth were spinning sphere, water would need container/force to hold it on curved surface. Suggests oceans remaining on Earth without flowing off edges implies Earth is flat plane with boundaries (ice wall/Antarctica) rather than borderless sphere4:T4a3,Falling Down movie meme featuring Michael Douglas as character D-FENS/William Foster. Shows Douglas in iconic scene standing on grassy hill with urban skyline visible in hazy purple-blue background. Character wears white short-sleeve dress shirt, dark striped tie, black pants, thick-framed glasses. Hair slicked back, stern expression on face. Holds black briefcase in right hand, rifle/weapon in left hand. Green grass and small tree visible in foreground. Cityscape buildings create misty backdrop. Image captures moment of character's breakdown and rejection of society. Top text in large outlined white letters: 'WHEN YOU REALIZE'. Top right shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark. Bottom text: 'THEY LIED ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH'. References Falling Down's themes of discovering uncomfortable truths about society and rejecting mainstream narratives. Character's armed rebellion against societal norms parallels flat Earth awakening narrative of discovering deception. Uses Michael Douglas' intense expression and armed stance to convey anger at perceived lies about Earth's shape. Suggests flat Earth realization leads to fundamental questioning of all authority and institutions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-150","title":"Other 150","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440597_481006972099042_1879922258013738237_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-149","title":"Other 149","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440586_477157479150658_7825537357449352860_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-151","title":"Other 151","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440787_503315173201555_6202945621858404569_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist absurdist humor meme with white/light gray background. Shows large bold outlined text in three lines. Top line in huge letters: 'UNBELIEVABLE!' Second line in large gray outlined text: 'MY KITCHEN TABLE'. Third line: 'IS A SPHERE!' Bottom portion shows curved edge of dark brown wooden table surface suggesting round/spherical shape. Middle of image shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark in white text. Sarcastic meme using reductio ad absurdum argument. Mocks mainstream science by applying sphere logic to everyday flat objects. Argues that just as obviously flat kitchen table would be absurd to call spherical, so too is calling Earth a sphere when it appears flat to human observation. Uses simple household object analogy to make globe Earth seem ridiculous. Employs exaggerated disbelief ('UNBELIEVABLE!') to suggest claiming sphericity for observably flat objects is preposterous. Implies direct sensory experience (table is flat) should override scientific models (Earth is sphere)"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
