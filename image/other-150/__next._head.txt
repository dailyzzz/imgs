5:T527,Artistic cross-section sculpture demonstrating water's properties with text overlay. Shows gray neutral background. Sculpture appears to be concrete or stone cut away to reveal transparent turquoise/teal resin or glass representing water inside. Gray concrete/stone forms irregular container with curved bottom surface and architectural features like arched opening/window. Transparent blue-green material fills container showing water conforming to shape with realistic surface tension - small ripples and waves visible at top surface suggesting movement. Vertical striations in transparent material create realistic water texture. Small cylindrical brown object (possibly lighthouse or post) protrudes from top of structure. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER TAKES THE SHAPE OF ITS RECEPTACLE AND FINDS ITS LEVEL'. Bottom text: 'AND IT FLOWS OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES KEEPING IT IN'. Right side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Demonstrates fundamental properties of water - conforming to container shape and seeking level surface. Argues if Earth were spinning sphere, water would need container/force to hold it on curved surface. Suggests oceans remaining on Earth without flowing off edges implies Earth is flat plane with boundaries (ice wall/Antarctica) rather than borderless sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 150 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Artistic cross-section sculpture demonstrating water's properties with text overlay.
