5:T409,Two-panel comparison meme contrasting complexity of 'proof' for globe vs flat Earth. Top panel labeled 'PROOF OF THE GLOBE' in yellow text shows black background filled with complex mathematical equations, formulas, graphs, and diagrams in white and colored chalk. Includes calculus notations, trigonometric functions, coordinate systems, geometric diagrams with sine/cosine waves, algebraic expressions like 'y = ax² + bx + c', physics formulas. Shows curved Earth image at bottom with blue oceans and white clouds against black space. Symbolizes abstract mathematical models used to support spherical Earth. Bottom panel labeled 'PROOF OF THE PLANE' shows simple photograph of actual flat landscape - vast agricultural plains with green fields extending to horizon under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Contrasts complex theoretical mathematics (globe proof) with simple observable reality (flat proof), suggesting direct observation of flat horizon is more valid than mathematical abstractions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 107 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel comparison meme contrasting complexity of 'proof' for globe vs flat Earth.
