3:T40c,Two-panel comparison meme demonstrating simultaneous sunset and sunrise. Top panel shows dusky sunset scene over water in Japan with pinkish-orange sky, dark silhouette of vehicle and landscape, reflection on water surface. Caption reads 'I sent my parents a picture of the sunset in Japan.' Bottom panel shows golden sunrise over ocean in Florida with bright yellow sun partially above horizon, layered clouds, blue water reflecting sunlight. Caption reads 'They sent me a picture 20 minutes later of the sunrise from Florida.' Below panels shows Tumblr/social media conversation: 'unwinona:', 'tattoos-n-tokes Deactivated.', 'this is why the world is beautiful. maybe its just me but i find this cool as fuck', and '*Your kid says hi.' -The sun'. Watermark 'Poxlize' at bottom. Demonstrates Earth's rotation causing simultaneous day/night in different locations, though sometimes used in flat Earth discussions to question how sun can set and rise simultaneously on spherical Earth (actually expected due to Earth's rotation and size)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-20","title":"The Sun 20","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/290c4ac2d79e471b3f6f0d26be2c21a6.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-19","title":"The Sun 19","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/286406803_1675006936213298_5147074918678646580_n.jpeg","description":"Educational diagram about Earth-Sun distance and seasons with white background. Header text reads 'According to NASA, the amount of distance between the earth and the sun has no impact on our climate or seasons.' Shows elliptical orbit (blue oval) with large yellow sun at center and two small Earth globes at opposite sides. Left Earth labeled 'Summer' at distance '94.44 Million miles' and right Earth labeled 'Winter' at distance '91.33 Million miles'. Center text asks 'In fact we're closer to the sun when it's colder...?' Questions common misconception that seasons are caused by varying Earth-Sun distance. Actually demonstrates correct astronomical fact: Earth is closer to sun during Northern Hemisphere winter (perihelion) and farther during summer (aphelion), proving seasons result from axial tilt (23.5°) rather than distance variation. However, presentation implies this is contradictory or suspicious rather than expected consequence of axial tilt model"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-21","title":"The Sun 21","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/29101204_1949928765077761_4140675758441889792_n.jpeg","description":"Humorous skeleton meme showing contemplative skeleton sitting in brown leather chair by fireplace, hand on chin in thinking pose. White text at top reads 'ME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY COULD HAVE MEASURED' and bottom text states 'THE WEIGHT OF THE SUN FROM 93 MILLION MILES AWAY'. Left side shows bright orange fireplace flames with '@FREDENKLW' watermark visible. Questions how scientists determined sun's mass (approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg) from Earth. Implies measurement is impossible or fabricated due to distance. Actually, solar mass is calculated through gravitational effects on planets using Kepler's laws and Newton's law of universal gravitation, not direct weighing. Earth's orbital period and distance allow precise calculation without physical contact. Meme uses humor to suggest skepticism toward established astronomical measurements and calculations"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
