Bernard Cohen (likely discussing historical astronomy debates or observational limitations) taken out of context to suggest Earth's orbital motion cannot be proven through direct observation. Quote mining technique presenting physicist's statement about observational challenges as denial of heliocentric model, though Cohen was mainstream science historian who accepted heliocentric cosmology and was describing historical experimental challenges, not denying orbital motion."},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-8","title":"Pseudo Science 8","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19247869_247796005708546_7795542160991317671_n.jpeg","description":"Black and white portrait quote meme showing physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) in formal attire.

Yellow text quote: 'The failure of the many attempts to measure terrestrially any effects of the earth's motion...' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, WOLFGANG PAULIL •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. References Pauli discussing null results of experiments attempting to detect Earth's motion through space (likely referencing Michelson-Morley and similar experiments). Quote appears to support stationary Earth interpretation, though historically Pauli accepted special relativity which explained null results through spacetime framework rather than stationary Earth. Selective quote mining to suggest prominent physicist questioned Earth's motion, omitting his acceptance of relativistic physics that reconciled experimental results with heliocentric model."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-10","title":"Pseudo Science 10","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19260679_247795962375217_711734426133789066_n.jpeg","description":"Quote meme with portrait of Carl Sagan in red turtleneck sweater against blurred galaxy/space background. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'We are unreconstructed geocentrists hiding behind a Copernican veneer.' Attribution: '• CARL SAGAN•' followed by hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. Quote suggests that despite accepting heliocentric model intellectually, humans intuitively maintain geocentric (Earth-centered) worldview in daily experience and perception. Presented out of context to imply even prominent scientists like Carl Sagan acknowledged problems with heliocentric model, though actual quote likely refers to psychological/perceptual human tendency to experience Earth as stationary center, not rejection of heliocentrism. Selective quote mining from Sagan who was strong advocate of scientific astronomy and heliocentric model."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
