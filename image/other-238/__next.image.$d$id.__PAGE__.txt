3:T5f3,Globe Earth on textbooks contrasting education versus indoctrination. Shows artistic still life photograph on wooden surface against black background.

Books stacked at angles creating academic library aesthetic. Left side shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark in white text. Top text in large white bold letters: 'THIS IS NOT EDUCATION'. Bottom text: 'THIS IS INDOCTRINATION'. Image argues that teaching globe Earth model through academic curriculum represents indoctrination rather than genuine education. Claims educational system presents globe as unquestionable fact across all subjects - geography, history, politics, science - creating reinforcement through repetition. Suggests true education would encourage questioning and independent investigation rather than accepting authoritative claims. Globe literally positioned on foundation labeled 'education' symbolizes how worldview is built into institutional learning from childhood4:T5b8,Two-panel comparison meme about research vs television belief. Top panel shows mysterious hooded figure in black robe or hoodie hunched over silver laptop computer against light blue-gray background. Face obscured by shadow and hood, creating anonymous hacker or researcher aesthetic. Laptop screen glows with white light. Text overlay at top reads: 'I GET MADE FUN OF FOR RESEARCHING THINGS'. Center of panel displays 'fb.com/fematters' URL. Bottom text: 'ON A COMPUTER'. Bottom panel shows young man sitting on dark blue couch or bed against beige wall.

Arms rest at sides in relaxed position against cushions. Body language suggests apathy or resignation. White text at bottom reads: 'BY PEOPLE WHO BLINDLY BELIEVE WHAT THEY SEE ON TELEVISION'. Meme contrasts active research using internet resources versus passive acceptance of television programming. Flat Earth community uses this to portray themselves as independent investigators unfairly ridiculed by mainstream society that uncritically accepts media narratives. Suggests television viewers are intellectually lazy while internet researchers are pursuing truth. References cultural tension between alternative media consumers and traditional news audiences. Implies flat Earth conclusions result from diligent research rather than conspiracy thinking5:T5d1,Ocean sunset with flat horizon featuring Side-Eye Chloe meme. Shows dramatic seascape photograph at sunset over ocean or large body of water. Sky dominates image with spectacular cloud formations in layered horizontal bands. Top shows thick dark orange-brown clouds with textured undersides. Middle section displays golden-yellow illuminated clouds catching sunlight. Lower atmosphere shows gradient from bright orange-yellow to deep red-orange near horizon. Brilliant yellow-orange sun sits at horizon line appearing as perfect semi-circle half-submerged below water's edge. Sun creates bright golden reflection path across water surface. Water shows dark blue-black in foreground transitioning to red-orange reflections in middle distance. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight across entire width of image where water meets sky. Upper text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SILLY BALLERS "BELIEVE" WE ARE SEEING THE CURVE OF THE EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' in yellow text. Lower section displays white text: 'AT SEA LEVEL'. Lower right corner features small image of young blonde girl (Side-Eye Chloe meme - Chloe Clem viral photo from 2013) in purple jacket giving skeptical sideways glance with raised eyebrow, expressing doubt. Meme mocks 'ball Earthers' who claim to see Earth's curvature at sea level. Flat horizon used as evidence against spherical Earth. Side-Eye Chloe's skeptical expression reinforces ridicule toward mainstream belief0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-238","title":"Other 238","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670796_472678899598516_3721156154901980101_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-237","title":"Other 237","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670728_482421525290920_6743353139010463388_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-239","title":"Other 239","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671748_484313121768427_7361555279972798088_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
