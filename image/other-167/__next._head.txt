5:T4cd,Four-panel comparison of Felix Baumgartner's Red Bull Stratos space jump questioning curvature. Shows Austrian skydiver during record-breaking 2012 jump from stratosphere (128,100 feet). All panels show Baumgartner in white spacesuit with Red Bull branding, attached to capsule/balloon equipment. Top-left panel: astronaut against Earth backdrop with text 'NO CURVATURE' - horizon appears flat. Top-right panel: similar angle showing flat horizon. Bottom-left panel: marked 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS', shows different camera angle with curved horizon visible, labeled 'CURVATURE'. Bottom-right panel: shows pronounced curved horizon with blue atmospheric glow. All images show brown-tan landmass below, deep blue sky/space above, white stratospheric haze. 'ZENITH' visible on equipment. Argues Red Bull Stratos footage shows inconsistent horizon curvature depending on camera/lens used. Questions why some angles show flat horizon while others show curve from same altitude. Flat Earth proponents claim curved images result from fisheye lens distortion rather than actual Earth curvature. Suggests deliberate deception using camera tricks to make Earth appear spherical when straight-lens footage shows flat horizon at 24-mile altitude0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 167 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Four-panel comparison of Felix Baumgartner's Red Bull Stratos space jump questioning curvature.
