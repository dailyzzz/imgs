3:T4cd,Four-panel comparison of Felix Baumgartner's Red Bull Stratos space jump questioning curvature. Shows Austrian skydiver during record-breaking 2012 jump from stratosphere (128,100 feet). All panels show Baumgartner in white spacesuit with Red Bull branding, attached to capsule/balloon equipment. Top-left panel: astronaut against Earth backdrop with text 'NO CURVATURE' - horizon appears flat. Top-right panel: similar angle showing flat horizon. Bottom-left panel: marked 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS', shows different camera angle with curved horizon visible, labeled 'CURVATURE'. Bottom-right panel: shows pronounced curved horizon with blue atmospheric glow. All images show brown-tan landmass below, deep blue sky/space above, white stratospheric haze. 'ZENITH' visible on equipment. Argues Red Bull Stratos footage shows inconsistent horizon curvature depending on camera/lens used. Questions why some angles show flat horizon while others show curve from same altitude. Flat Earth proponents claim curved images result from fisheye lens distortion rather than actual Earth curvature. Suggests deliberate deception using camera tricks to make Earth appear spherical when straight-lens footage shows flat horizon at 24-mile altitude4:T4a5,Satirical Pear Earth Society logo parody. White background with black serif text at top: 'THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY' and 'thepearearthsociety.org' website. Center shows circular emblem with black outline. Inside circle sits pear-shaped Earth illustration - irregular lumpy blue-green globe with continents visible including orange Australia, resembling actual pear fruit shape with stem at top (North Pole area). Blue represents oceans, green/gray shows landmasses. Bottom banner ribbon across circle displays Latin motto 'IN VERITATE VICTORIA' (In Truth Victory). Bottom right watermark 'Flat Earth Matters' in light gray. Parodies Flat Earth Society by proposing equally absurd alternative Earth shape. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (pear-shaped due to equatorial bulge), which flat Earth proponents mock as excuse for why Earth doesn't look perfectly spherical in photos. Satirizes how mainstream science keeps modifying Earth's shape description (perfect sphere → oblate spheroid → pear-shaped) to explain photographic inconsistencies. Uses humor to suggest if scientists can claim Earth is pear-shaped, flat Earth is no more absurd5:T426,Dramatic black and white photograph with truth-seeking message. Shows person's open palm/hand with 'seek Truth' handwritten in black marker or paint on skin. Letters appear rough and hand-drawn. Background shows blurred hand/fingers in monochrome. Top right corner displays circular flat Earth map icon (azimuthal equidistant projection) showing blue oceans and tan/yellow continents with North Pole at center. Top text in white: 'REAL "TRUTHERS" SEEK TRUTH'. Bottom text in white: 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH!'. Right side watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Encourages independent research and investigation rather than accepting mainstream narratives. Hand-written message suggests personal agency and individual journey to truth. Appeals to truth-seeker identity, suggesting real truthers question everything including Earth's shape. Implies those who claim to seek truth but don't investigate flat Earth are hypocrites or incomplete in their pursuit. Uses intimate personal imagery (open palm) to create sense of vulnerability and authenticity in truth-seeking journey0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-167","title":"Other 167","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12496200_460126534187086_82579205709002182_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-166","title":"Other 166","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12495251_468500190016387_8278333110528552931_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-168","title":"Other 168","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12507331_455485767984496_265040420058614386_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
