5:T41e,Historical physics satire meme with black and white classical portrait of Isaac Newton with long curly hair seated at desk. Dark textured background with white text narrative: 'Here is how it went down: Newton made up Gravity... later they realized the calculations all lead to a giant singularity where all of the universe gets squished into oblivion... To counter that they made up Dark Energy which is basically Anti-Gravity... ...But, then calculations now showed everything will move away from each other until Dark Energy rips the very fabric of "Outer-Space"... So to balance both,.. they made up Dark Matter to hold Gravitons and Dark Energies together... It is one imaginary justification after another after another... One BIG Imaginary Psyop'. Satirizes modern cosmology by presenting gravity, dark energy, and dark matter as successive fabrications created to fix contradictions in previous theories rather than observable phenomena. Frames entire gravitational physics framework as psychological operation (psyop) built on imaginary concepts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 10 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical physics satire meme with black and white classical portrait of Isaac Newton with long curly hair seated at desk.
