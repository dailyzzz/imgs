3:T41e,Historical physics satire meme with black and white classical portrait of Isaac Newton with long curly hair seated at desk. Dark textured background with white text narrative: 'Here is how it went down: Newton made up Gravity... later they realized the calculations all lead to a giant singularity where all of the universe gets squished into oblivion... To counter that they made up Dark Energy which is basically Anti-Gravity... ...But, then calculations now showed everything will move away from each other until Dark Energy rips the very fabric of "Outer-Space"... So to balance both,.. they made up Dark Matter to hold Gravitons and Dark Energies together... It is one imaginary justification after another after another... One BIG Imaginary Psyop'. Satirizes modern cosmology by presenting gravity, dark energy, and dark matter as successive fabrications created to fix contradictions in previous theories rather than observable phenomena. Frames entire gravitational physics framework as psychological operation (psyop) built on imaginary concepts4:T61b,Alternative gravity theory infographic with dark gradient background (gray-green-brown) and yellow person icon at bottom. White text at top: 'The roof of the sky is 100% closed and it is completely flat. This roof is the gas in the earth. This is why air pressure will be produced inside the earth. Everything under the roof of the sky has a special density and weight.' Presents atmospheric density explanation with four gas layers labeled in yellow: 'hydrogen' and 'Helium' at top (brown section), 'Nitrogen' in middle (teal section), 'Oxygen' at bottom (gray section). Each section includes cyan text explaining properties. Top: 'The reason for the leveling of water surfaces is the effect of atmospheric pressure, And the waves of the sea moving by the wind.' Middle: 'Gases have their own weight and density and they accumulate on top of each other'. Lower middle: 'Your body is fixed on the ground and you take up space in the air particles, unless you affect you like a wind'. Bottom: Yellow icon with text 'Considering that above you the roof of the sky is closed and it prevents the leakage of gases from inside the ground. Your body has its own density and mass, and that's what makes the objects stand on the ground.' Final section: 'Heavy gases such as ethane, methane, propane and butane. Are located inside the earth because they are higher in weight and weight than oxygen gas.' Proposes alternative to gravity using atmospheric pressure, gas density stratification, and enclosed firmament dome model to explain why objects fall and remain grounded5:T697,Comprehensive anti-gravity infographic with black background and three main sections. Top banner in yellow: 'GRAVITY is a false GOD' with Apollo mission patch on left and NASA logo on right. Subtitle: 'Gravity is the answer for everything the 'official experts' can't explain and doesn't make sense on a spinning ball earth'. Middle section titled 'GRAVITY' lists questions gravity supposedly answers: 'How does the earth orbit the sun? Gravity', 'Why do we stick to the spinning, ball earth? Gravity', 'Why doesn't the water fly off a ball spinning 1000 miles per hour? Gravity', 'Why does the moon orbit the earth? Gravity', 'What causes the tides? Gravity', 'Why do the wandering stars called 'planets' move in relation to the fixed stars of constellations? Gravity'. Text includes 'DON'T LET GO' with globe Earth image and United Nations logo showing azimuthal equidistant projection. Notes planets named after Roman/Greek deities (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn). States: 'When people say 'gravity is the cause of it' they may as well say 'God is the cause of it', the belief in Gravity does not have anything to do with science but everything to do with religion.' Bottom section titled 'Assumptions of the theory of Gravity:' lists: Forms spheres in space/bending water, Creates black holes, Has separate boson (Graviton), Attracts everything with mass, Bends invisible field (space time), Bends Light, Attracts everything to centre of mass, Mass exists. Right side contains red-bordered boxes explaining these are NLP mind control assumptions using 'Pacing and Leading' technique, and that observable evidence of things falling is evidence of density, not gravity theory0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-10","title":"Gravity 10","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/29425138_765320017009181_2015062990151221248_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-9","title":"Gravity 9","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/22195797_919623294861433_4750403436180977336_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-11","title":"Gravity is the answer for everything the ","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/29683106_10210712837246657_8216664232843326053_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
