5:T8e8,Wernher von Braun Operation Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist collage arguing NASA founded by Nazis. Multi-panel historical photograph collage highlighting Wernher von Braun's Nazi past and role founding NASA space program. Top section shows two black and white photographs from 1940s Nazi Germany. Left photo: von Braun in dark suit standing among Nazi military officers in Wehrmacht uniforms with caps, military decorations visible. Right photo: Close-up of von Braun in civilian dark suit surrounded by Nazi SS officers in uniform with peaked caps showing Nazi insignia. Photos document his role as technical director of Nazi V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde. Large white text spanning top: 'WERNHER VON BRAUN'. Red text below: 'NAZI ROCKET SCIENTIST'. Middle section shows photographs from post-war America. Left: von Braun in sunglasses standing at Cape Canaveral with rocket launch structures visible in background. Center: Large Saturn V rocket engines/components showing massive F-1 engine bells used in Apollo moon missions. Right: von Braun in suit examining rocket hardware. White text: 'ESCAPING CHARGES IN THE NUREMBERG TRIALS HE WAS LATER SMUGGLED INTO THE U.S. UNDER OPERATION: PAPERCLIP'. Bottom section shows NASA era photos. Left: Elderly von Braun in NASA facility. Center: Row of Saturn V rockets displayed vertically. Right: von Braun in suit standing before rockets. Large white text: 'WHERE HE WAS MADE 1ST DIRECTOR OF NASA'S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER'. Lower right: 'Nick Havok' signature. Collage presents historical facts about Operation Paperclip - secret program recruiting German scientists after WWII, including von Braun and team. Von Braun used slave labor from Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp during V-2 production, causing thousands of deaths. His SS membership and knowledge of atrocities controversial. However, his technical contributions to US space program undeniable - Saturn V development enabled Apollo moon landings. Meme implies NASA fundamentally tainted by Nazi origins, suggesting space program continues Nazi deception/propaganda. While historical connection factual, modern NASA evolved far beyond von Braun, includes diverse international scientists, operates transparently with public missions verified by independent nations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 307 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Wernher von Braun Operation Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist collage arguing NASA founded by Nazis.
