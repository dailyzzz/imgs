3:T8e8,Wernher von Braun Operation Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist collage arguing NASA founded by Nazis. Multi-panel historical photograph collage highlighting Wernher von Braun's Nazi past and role founding NASA space program. Top section shows two black and white photographs from 1940s Nazi Germany. Left photo: von Braun in dark suit standing among Nazi military officers in Wehrmacht uniforms with caps, military decorations visible. Right photo: Close-up of von Braun in civilian dark suit surrounded by Nazi SS officers in uniform with peaked caps showing Nazi insignia. Photos document his role as technical director of Nazi V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde. Large white text spanning top: 'WERNHER VON BRAUN'. Red text below: 'NAZI ROCKET SCIENTIST'. Middle section shows photographs from post-war America. Left: von Braun in sunglasses standing at Cape Canaveral with rocket launch structures visible in background. Center: Large Saturn V rocket engines/components showing massive F-1 engine bells used in Apollo moon missions. Right: von Braun in suit examining rocket hardware. White text: 'ESCAPING CHARGES IN THE NUREMBERG TRIALS HE WAS LATER SMUGGLED INTO THE U.S. UNDER OPERATION: PAPERCLIP'. Bottom section shows NASA era photos. Left: Elderly von Braun in NASA facility. Center: Row of Saturn V rockets displayed vertically. Right: von Braun in suit standing before rockets. Large white text: 'WHERE HE WAS MADE 1ST DIRECTOR OF NASA'S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER'. Lower right: 'Nick Havok' signature. Collage presents historical facts about Operation Paperclip - secret program recruiting German scientists after WWII, including von Braun and team. Von Braun used slave labor from Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp during V-2 production, causing thousands of deaths. His SS membership and knowledge of atrocities controversial. However, his technical contributions to US space program undeniable - Saturn V development enabled Apollo moon landings. Meme implies NASA fundamentally tainted by Nazi origins, suggesting space program continues Nazi deception/propaganda. While historical connection factual, modern NASA evolved far beyond von Braun, includes diverse international scientists, operates transparently with public missions verified by independent nations4:T9ed,Earth's multiple motions with gyroscope stability argument meme. Two-panel educational image arguing gyroscopes would malfunction if Earth had complex motion. Top section shows scientific visualization of solar system motion on black starfield background. Central yellow-orange sun shown as glowing sphere with corona. Curved blue orbital paths trace Earth's movement - multiple elliptical and spiral trajectories overlapping showing Earth's simultaneous motions. Yellow arrow/beam extends from orbital region toward sun suggesting directional movement. Small spheres visible representing planets at different orbital positions - one appears moon-like (gray), another Earth-like (blue-green), yellow/tan planet possibly Venus or Mars. Complex interweaving blue curves illustrate compound motion: Earth rotating on axis, orbiting sun, sun moving through galaxy, galaxy moving through space. White text overlays in sans-serif font: 'IF THIS WAS TRUE', 'EARTH IS ROTATING AT 1,000 MPH' (equatorial rotation speed), 'WHILE REVOLVING AROUND SUN AT 66,600 MPH' (orbital velocity), 'AS THE SUN IS BLASTING THROUGH SPACE AT 450,000 MPH' (solar system's motion through Milky Way). Bottom section displays labeled diagram of mechanical gyroscope on white background. Cross-sectional view shows components: outer 'Gyroscope frame' (gray ring), middle 'Outer gimbal' and 'Inner gimbal' (red/pink rings allowing rotation on multiple axes), central 'Rotor' (yellow disc representing spinning mass), vertical 'Spin axis' (pink rod through center). Diagram demonstrates gimbal suspension allowing rotor to maintain orientation regardless of frame movement. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'ALL GYROSCOPES WOULD BE GOING APE SHIT'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Meme argues if Earth had multiple simultaneous high-speed motions in different directions, gyroscopes would show chaotic behavior rather than stable orientation. However, this misunderstands inertial reference frames and gyroscope physics. Gyroscopes maintain orientation relative to local inertial frame - since all objects on/near Earth share same motions, there's no relative motion to detect. Similar to how gyroscope on moving airplane maintains stability - detects aircraft rotation, not Earth's motion beneath. Earth's rotation IS detectable by precision gyroscopes (demonstrated by Foucault pendulum, ring laser gyroscopes, fiber optic gyroscopes used in navigation), but orbital and galactic motion irrelevant because we're in same reference frame5:T9df,Person in ice cave with text about water level versus convexity argument. Atmospheric photograph with philosophical text overlaid making flat Earth water level argument. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows silhouette of person standing in opening of ice cave or glacier tunnel. Person appears small against massive ice formation, positioned in center looking outward. Ice walls visible on sides - brilliant white/light blue glacial ice with textured surface showing layers, cracks, formations. Opening frames view of outside landscape visible as bright light area. Sky beyond shows gradient from white to deep blue suggesting daytime with clear conditions. Person's silhouette backlit creating dramatic contrast - appears to be standing, possibly wearing jacket or backpack. Ice formations create natural arch/tunnel framing the scene. Blue lighting dominates image with cooler tones - characteristic of glacier/ice cave photography where thick ice filters sunlight creating ethereal blue glow. Text overlay in white centered on lower portion of image: 'If the Earth is spherical then it follows that the surface of all Earth's water, including the massive oceans, must maintain a certain degree of convexity. But this is contrary to the fundamental physical nature of water to always be and remain level!' Statement makes classic flat Earth argument about water finding its level. Claims convex water surface contradicts water's nature. Core misunderstanding: 'level' doesn't mean flat in absolute sense - means perpendicular to gravitational force direction. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface. Water DOES curve following Earth's sphere while remaining 'level' locally at every point. Gravity pulls toward Earth's center, not uniformly downward in absolute sense. Every location's 'down' points toward planetary core. Therefore water surfaces curve globally while appearing level locally. Observable evidence of water curvature: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon (water curves between observer and ship), inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon distance, submarine and ship navigation using spherical trigonometry, need for locks in Panama/Suez canals accounting for different 'sea level' (both tangent to sphere but different absolute heights). Image location in ice cave/glacier ironic since glaciers flow downhill following gravity, demonstrating water responds to gravitational field consistent with spherical Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-307","title":"Other 307","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745930_466668016866271_3802006221260945192_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-306","title":"Other 306","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745760_465537190312687_3964998623303873642_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-308","title":"Other 308","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747465_465960070270399_9062437940598786058_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
