5:T592,Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting dark ocean water. Shows stunning aerial or elevated photograph of Antarctic ice formation. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates left and upper portion - flat white-blue ice surface extending to horizon with slight undulations and cracks visible. Ice shows various shades of white, pale blue, light gray. Far background shows distant Antarctic mountains or ice formations with blue-gray peaks under overcast sky with gray-blue clouds. Right side and lower portion shows dark teal-blue-green ocean water with small white ice chunks and brash ice floating on surface. Most dramatic feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or ice wall where shelf meets ocean - clean geometric edge showing stratified layers of compressed ice in blue-white-gray bands. Cliff face appears 50-100+ feet tall, perfectly vertical or slightly overhanging. Water at base shows lighter turquoise-green color from glacial melt and ice particles. Perspective shows curve or bend in ice edge stretching into distance. No text or watermarks visible. Flat Earth proponents frequently share Antarctic ice shelf imagery as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc, preventing water from spilling off edges and blocking access to whatever lies beyond. Antarctic Treaty of 1959 cited as conspiracy to restrict exploration of ice wall. Mainstream geography shows Antarctica as continent at South Pole0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 218 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting dark ocean water.
