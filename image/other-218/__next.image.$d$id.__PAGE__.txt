3:T592,Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting dark ocean water. Shows stunning aerial or elevated photograph of Antarctic ice formation. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates left and upper portion - flat white-blue ice surface extending to horizon with slight undulations and cracks visible. Ice shows various shades of white, pale blue, light gray. Far background shows distant Antarctic mountains or ice formations with blue-gray peaks under overcast sky with gray-blue clouds. Right side and lower portion shows dark teal-blue-green ocean water with small white ice chunks and brash ice floating on surface. Most dramatic feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or ice wall where shelf meets ocean - clean geometric edge showing stratified layers of compressed ice in blue-white-gray bands. Cliff face appears 50-100+ feet tall, perfectly vertical or slightly overhanging. Water at base shows lighter turquoise-green color from glacial melt and ice particles. Perspective shows curve or bend in ice edge stretching into distance. No text or watermarks visible. Flat Earth proponents frequently share Antarctic ice shelf imagery as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc, preventing water from spilling off edges and blocking access to whatever lies beyond. Antarctic Treaty of 1959 cited as conspiracy to restrict exploration of ice wall. Mainstream geography shows Antarctica as continent at South Pole4:T6af,Nikola Tesla vs Albert Einstein comparison on relativity theory. Shows dark blue textured background with side-by-side vintage photographs of two famous physicists. Left side shows Nikola Tesla - dark slicked-back hair, thin mustache, wearing dark suit jacket with white collar, gazing to right with serious expression. Right side shows Albert Einstein - wild curly dark hair, thick mustache, wearing dark suit jacket, looking forward. Top displays golden-yellow text: 'Tesla on Einstein'. Main text in white and gold explains: 'When asked for his opinion on the theories of contemporary Albert Einstein, Tesla gave a scathing analysis of Relativity theory, calling it a' followed by gold italic text quote: 'magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king' with attribution '(Time, 1935).' Below continues: 'Tesla's own theorem went unpublished, yet his inventions displayed a beautiful simplicity that reflected the natural order:' followed by gold italic quote: 'My explanations of natural phenomena are not so involved as his, They are simpler, and... will throw light on many puzzling phenomena of the cosmos' with attribution '(Time, 1931).' Bottom shows 'Flat Earth Matters' in gray text. Contrasts Tesla's empirical approach with Einstein's mathematical relativity. Flat Earth proponents cite Tesla's criticism to suggest Einstein's theories are ungrounded mathematical abstractions divorced from physical reality. Uses appeal to authority of Tesla as inventor who achieved tangible results versus Einstein as theoretical physicist working in abstract mathematics5:T51b,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning ship disappearing perspective. Shows Keanu Reeves as character from film with long dark brown messy hair, wearing white loose-fitting garment or shirt. Has confused, contemplative facial expression - mouth slightly open, eyes wide with puzzled look, eyebrows raised. Background blurred showing neutral beige-tan colors suggesting indoor setting. Top text in large white bold Impact font with black outline: 'WHAT IF SHIPS SAILING OVER THE HORIZON'. Bottom right corner shows small 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text: 'IS REALLY JUST PERSPECTIVE?' Uses Conspiracy Keanu meme format (originated 2011) depicting sudden realization or mind-blown conspiracy theory moment. Questions mainstream explanation that ships disappear hull-first over horizon due to Earth's curvature. Suggests alternative explanation: ships appear to sink due to perspective convergence and atmospheric effects rather than physical curve. Flat Earth argument claims with powerful zoom equipment (like Nikon P900 camera), ships can be brought back into view even after appearing to go over horizon, suggesting they never went behind curve but just became too small for naked eye to see. Challenges one of oldest and most cited proofs of spherical Earth dating back to ancient Greek observations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-218","title":"Other 218","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12646894_461770194022720_9205492253484093066_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-217","title":"Other 217","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12645225_457886284411111_918310355111631575_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-219","title":"Other 219","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12647147_459883260878080_9003912119980330214_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
