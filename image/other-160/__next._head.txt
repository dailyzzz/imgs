5:T579,Samuel Birley Rowbotham quote over stunning twilight castle photograph. Shows famous Chillon Castle on Lake Geneva, Switzerland at dusk. Medieval stone castle with cylindrical towers, turrets, and battlements sits on rocky outcrop extending into calm lake water. Warm golden lighting illuminates castle's yellow-beige stone walls. Castle reflection perfectly mirrored in still dark blue water below. Left side shows silhouetted mountain range extending into distance. Sky transitions from deep blue at top through pink-lavender tones to lighter blue near horizon. Lake surface appears completely flat and mirror-smooth. White text overlay at top reads: 'The facts and experiments already advanced render it undeniable, that the surface of all the waters of the earth is horizontal; and that, however irregular the upper outline of the land itself may be, the whole mass, land and water together, constitutes an IMMENSE NON-MOVING CIRCULAR PLANE.' Attribution: '- Samuel Birley Rowbotham'. Bottom left watermark 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Quote from Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816-1884), founder of modern flat Earth movement who wrote under pseudonym 'Parallax'. His book 'Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe' (1865) laid foundation for contemporary flat Earth arguments. Quote presents water's levelness as empirical proof Earth is stationary flat plane rather than rotating sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 160 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Samuel Birley Rowbotham quote over stunning twilight castle photograph.
