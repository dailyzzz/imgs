5:T5a5,Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle wheel on moon surface with visible tire tracks. Shows Apollo moon mission photograph of LRV (Lunar Roving Vehicle/moon buggy) on lunar surface. Visible portion shows vehicle's wire-mesh wheel in center-right - distinctive tire made of woven metal wire creating chevron/zigzag tread pattern for traction in lunar regolith. Wheel appears silver-gray metallic. Attached to wheel is white/light gray landing leg or strut structure, mechanical components, and what appears to be astronaut's boot in white spacesuit material upper right. Lunar surface shows fine gray dust/regolith with visible tire tracks impressed into surface - two white arrows point to clear tread marks showing chevron pattern pressed into moon dust, one track in foreground left, another in background right. Surface appears uniformly gray with small rocks and pebbles scattered throughout. Top displays large white bold text: 'GOT TRACKS?' in impact font with black outline. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark. Photograph intended to show evidence of moon landings through tire tracks. Moon hoax skeptics question why tracks are so crisp and well-defined in vacuum with no atmospheric moisture to hold shape. Also question why dust doesn't stick to astronaut boots or why rover doesn't throw up dust plumes like it should in low gravity one-sixth Earth's. Argue photographs show inconsistencies with expected lunar environment behavior0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 227 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle wheel on moon surface with visible tire tracks.
