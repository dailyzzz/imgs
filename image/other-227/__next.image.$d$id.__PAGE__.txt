3:T5a5,Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle wheel on moon surface with visible tire tracks. Shows Apollo moon mission photograph of LRV (Lunar Roving Vehicle/moon buggy) on lunar surface. Visible portion shows vehicle's wire-mesh wheel in center-right - distinctive tire made of woven metal wire creating chevron/zigzag tread pattern for traction in lunar regolith. Wheel appears silver-gray metallic. Attached to wheel is white/light gray landing leg or strut structure, mechanical components, and what appears to be astronaut's boot in white spacesuit material upper right. Lunar surface shows fine gray dust/regolith with visible tire tracks impressed into surface - two white arrows point to clear tread marks showing chevron pattern pressed into moon dust, one track in foreground left, another in background right. Surface appears uniformly gray with small rocks and pebbles scattered throughout. Top displays large white bold text: 'GOT TRACKS?' in impact font with black outline. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark. Photograph intended to show evidence of moon landings through tire tracks. Moon hoax skeptics question why tracks are so crisp and well-defined in vacuum with no atmospheric moisture to hold shape. Also question why dust doesn't stick to astronaut boots or why rover doesn't throw up dust plumes like it should in low gravity one-sixth Earth's. Argue photographs show inconsistencies with expected lunar environment behavior4:T547,Steve Harvey meme mocking Family Feud wrong answer format. Shows Steve Harvey, comedian and television host, on stage in formal attire. Harvey wears black tuxedo jacket with subtle pattern or texture, white dress shirt, black bow tie. Clean-shaven bald head, distinctive thick black mustache, wide white-toothed smile showing enthusiasm. Holds black microphone in right hand near mouth as if announcing or reacting. Left hand gestures expressively. Background shows dark teal-blue with blurred stage lights creating bokeh effect - suggests TV studio setting like Family Feud game show which Harvey hosts. Body language conveys animated, dramatic reaction typical of his comedic hosting style. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'THE EARTH IS A SPINNING BALL'. Meme format mimics Family Feud show where Harvey reacts to contestants giving obviously wrong answers with exaggerated disbelief. Implies belief in spinning globe Earth is comically wrong answer equivalent to absurd Family Feud responses. Harvey's enthusiastic delivery makes statement appear ridiculous. Uses humor to frame mainstream cosmology as laughable rather than scientifically established. Leverages Harvey's comedic persona and Family Feud's wrong-answer culture to delegitimize globe Earth model5:T5b0,B.o.B rapper Twitter screenshots defending flat Earth position. Shows composite image with B.o.B promotional photo and Twitter posts. Large background image shows B.o.B (Bobby Ray Simmons Jr.), American rapper, in professional portrait. Wears black fedora hat, white shirt, silver chain necklace, looking to side with thoughtful expression. Text overlays show 'B.o.B' in large white letters. Right side displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Foreground shows three Twitter screenshots from verified account @bobatl with blue checkmark. Top tweet dated '4:20 PM - 25 Jan 2016' reads: 'Once you go flat, you never go back'. Second tweet shows profile image and username 'B.o.B @bobatl' with text: 'I'm going up against the greatest liars in history ... you've been tremendously deceived'. Third tweet from same account reads: 'Don't believe what I say, research what I say'. In January 2016, B.o.B sparked controversy by promoting flat Earth theory on Twitter, engaging in public debate with Neil deGrasse Tyson. B.o.B cited various arguments including lack of visible curvature, questioning official NASA imagery, and lighthouse visibility distances. Tyson responded with scientific explanations, leading to rap battle diss track 'Flatline' where B.o.B attacked mainstream science. Incident brought flat Earth theory into mainstream pop culture discussion. B.o.B's 'research what I say' encourages independent investigation rather than accepting authority0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-227","title":"Other 227","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661856_461369637396109_4173555124706847413_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-226","title":"Other 226","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657953_462403280626078_1359173339570927437_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-228","title":"Other 228","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661895_459877520878654_5572573329277913670_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
