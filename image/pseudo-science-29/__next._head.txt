5:T625,Quote meme showing elderly scientist or professor in formal dark suit with blue tie standing in front of white background covered with handwritten mathematical equations, integrals, logarithms, and calculus formulas. Man has white hair, gesturing with both hands raised as if explaining or lecturing. Wooden desk/podium on left side. Surrounding him are complex mathematical expressions including integrals (∫), logarithms (log₂), trigonometric functions (cos, sin), fractions, exponents, square roots. Bottom quote in black text: '"Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."' Attribution: '-Nikola Tesla'. Quote criticizes modern theoretical physics for relying too heavily on mathematical abstraction rather than empirical experimentation, claiming mathematical models become divorced from physical reality. Used to argue contemporary science (particularly relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology) is purely theoretical construction without experimental basis. Context: Tesla was experimental physicist who favored hands-on laboratory work over theoretical mathematics. Quote reflects his methodological preference but oversimplifies relationship between theory and experiment in modern physics. Ironic given that Tesla's own electromagnetic work is described mathematically and many theoretical predictions (gravitational waves, Higgs boson, etc.) were later experimentally confirmed decades after mathematical prediction.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 29 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Quote meme showing elderly scientist or professor in formal dark suit with blue tie standing in front of white background covered with handwritten mathematic..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pseudo Science 29"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Quote meme showing elderly scientist or professor in formal dark suit with blue tie standing in front of white background covered with handwritten mathematic..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/41195629_1996823577008854_8576308533375533056_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
