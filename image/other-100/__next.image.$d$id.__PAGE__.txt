Bottom text: 'AND MANY OF THEM ARE SO INURED, SO HOPELESSLY DEPENDENT ON THE GLOBE, THAT THEY WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT IT.' Digital world map shows glowing green grid overlay on dark Earth. Bottom right corner watermark 'JM FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. References Matrix movie concept of people trapped in simulated reality, comparing heliocentric globe Earth model to Matrix simulation. Argues majority of people are psychologically dependent on globe Earth worldview and will defend it despite evidence, similar to Matrix characters defending their prison.

Left side shows two geometric cross-section diagrams: top labeled 'ШАРОВАЯ ЗЕМЛЯ 25 МИЛЬ/Ч' (Ball Earth 25 Miles) with radius R=3959 Miles, bottom labeled 'ШАРОВАЯ ЗЕМЛЯ 8 КМ' (Ball Earth 8 KM) with radius R=6378.1 KM, both showing viewing angles and measurement lines in red. Right side contains detailed spreadsheet with Russian column headers for distance measurements and calculated drop/hidden heights from 1 to 3000 distance units. Table shows geometric calculations for how much distant objects should be obscured by Earth's curvature at various distances. Same technical content as English version, used in Russian-language flat Earth community to argue visible distant landmarks contradict spherical Earth curvature predictions"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-101","title":"Other 101","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/1016_473319262867813_2461694994339511523_n.jpg","description":"Two-panel meme about research methodology. Top panel shows businessman in gray checkered suit and black tie wearing blindfold over eyes, hands raised in questioning gesture against gradient gray background. White text reads 'DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I POST'. Bottom panel shows person in gray t-shirt sitting at desk with hands clasped in prayer/contemplation position, head bowed down over open book/papers. White coffee mug on left, tablet device with 'JM' logo on right. Flat Earth globe icon visible in background. White text reads 'RESEARCH WHAT I POST'. Bottom left shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark. Encourages independent verification of flat Earth claims rather than blind acceptance, promoting critical thinking and personal research. Contrasts blind faith (top blindfolded figure) with studious investigation (bottom studying figure).
