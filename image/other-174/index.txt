13:T553,Illuminati card game parody featuring Flat Earthers. Shows trading card with black border and red textured background with yellow triangular Illuminati eye symbols. Center displays illustration of flat rectangular Earth floating in black starry space. Earth shown as blue oceans with green/brown continents (Africa, Asia, Americas visible) on flat platform/slab. Small rocket or spacecraft visible below Earth. Top text in pink/salmon color: 'Flat Earthers'. Below image, pink text box contains game rules: 'People laugh, but the flat Earthers know something. For their action, you may roll 2 dice. If your roll is equal to or less than the number of Places you control, the Flat Earthers' weird alternate geology has led them to a gold strike, and you may draw as many Plot cards as the number you rolled.' Bottom shows game stats: 'POWER 1' on left, 'RESISTANCE 2' on right. Bottom labels: 'Weird, Conservative' in yellow text. Black border frames entire card. Satirical parody of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: New World Order conspiracy-themed card game. Card treats flat Earth belief as fringe conspiracy theory alongside other game's satirical secret societies. Game mechanics suggest flat Earthers are weird outsiders who occasionally stumble onto truth (gold strike) despite being laughed at. Conservative label associates flat Earth with right-wing politics14:T6ed,Collage showing top 10 longest rivers in world with flat Earth argument. Grid layout of 10 numbered aerial photographs showing various rivers and landscapes. Images show: 1. Nile River aerial view, 2. Amazon River meandering through rainforest, 3. Dramatic mountain/volcano with water, 4. River through green landscape, 5. Wide river delta with sand/mud patterns, 6. Desert landscape with water, 7. River winding through autumn-colored forest, 8. River through bright green vegetation, 9. Brown muddy river, 10. River through dense green forest. Bottom shows blue water/sky background with white text: 'top 10 longest rivers in the world' and website 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Attribution '©Ashlee Webster'. Bottom section lists rivers with details in white text: '1. The Nile River in Northeast Africa, which is 4,132 miles long. 2. The Amazon River in South America, which is 4,000 miles long. 3. The Yangtze River in China, which is 3,917 miles long. 4. The Mississippi/Missouri River in the United States, which is 3,902 miles long. 5. The Yenisei - Angara - Selenga River in Mongolia and Russia, which is 3,445 miles long. 6. The Yellow River in China, which is 3,398 miles long. 7. The Ob – Irtysh River, which runs through Russia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia. It is 3,365 miles long. 8. The Congo – Chambeshi River in Central Africa, which is 2,922 miles long. 9. The Amur – Argun River in Russia, China and Mongolia, which is 2,763 miles long. 10. The Lena River in Russia, which is 2,736 miles long.' Flat Earth argument questions how rivers thousands of miles long can flow downhill on curved surface. Suggests water's natural levelness contradicts spherical Earth model where rivers would have to flow uphill/downhill following curvature15:T485,Chuck Norris action hero meme rejecting gravity. Shows iconic 1980s/90s photograph of Chuck Norris in classic action hero pose. Norris wears sleeveless light blue denim shirt with chest exposed, brown hair and beard. Holds two large black handguns (possibly Uzis or MAC-10s) pointed in opposite directions with dramatic tough-guy stance. Smoky dark background creates action movie atmosphere. White speech bubble at top left: 'suck it, gravity'. Bottom text in white: 'Next time you hear someone use "gravity" as an excuse for some global miracle, switch it to Chuck Norris. It will still be a joke, but at least Chuck Norris exists.' Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Uses Chuck Norris Facts meme format (hyperbolic jokes about Norris defying physics/logic) to mock gravity as explanation for Earth's phenomena. Argues gravity is unproven theoretical force like fictional Chuck Norris superpowers. Suggests replacing gravity with Chuck Norris in scientific explanations makes equal sense because neither can be directly observed. Implies gravity is convenient magical explanation for how globe Earth functions, no more real than action hero mythology9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-174","title":"Other 174","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12510469_456893894510350_2372706113580209074_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-173","title":"Other 173","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12510375_454523174747422_3843744971093066101_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-175","title":"Other 175","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512370_480994238766982_5452094373629189205_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
