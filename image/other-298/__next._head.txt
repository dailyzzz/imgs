5:T805,Bob Ross painting fake globe Earth meme. Humorous image macro using beloved TV painter Bob Ross to suggest Earth imagery is fabricated art. Image shows Bob Ross in his iconic pose from 'The Joy of Painting' PBS television series. Ross wears light blue button-up shirt, stands beside easel holding wooden palette with paint colors in left hand, paintbrush in right hand. He has distinctive large curly afro hairstyle (dark brown), full beard, warm friendly smile. Background shows his painting studio with windows, white walls, painting supplies visible. On easel canvas displays painting of Earth from space - Blue Marble-style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents (appears to show North and South America). Painting looks photorealistic in style matching NASA Earth imagery. Upper left corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'LET'S JUST PAINT A FAKE LITTLE GLOBE IN THERE'. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Meme plays on Bob Ross's famous gentle phrases from his show ('happy little trees', 'happy little clouds') applying them to suggest NASA Earth images are literally paintings rather than photographs. Implies space agencies create artistic renderings and present them as authentic photos. Suggests deception - 'fake little globe' painted for propaganda purposes. However, Earth images come from multiple independent sources over 60+ years: Apollo missions, International Space Station, dozens of weather satellites, communications satellites, various nations' space programs (USA, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India), commercial satellites, astronauts from 40+ countries. Thousands of images from different angles, seasons, times, cameras all showing same spherical Earth. While some images are composites (multiple satellite passes stitched together) or enhanced for visibility, they're based on real photographic/sensor data, not paintings. Bob Ross himself would have appreciated actual beauty of Earth from space0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 298 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Bob Ross painting fake globe Earth meme.
