3:T805,Bob Ross painting fake globe Earth meme. Humorous image macro using beloved TV painter Bob Ross to suggest Earth imagery is fabricated art. Image shows Bob Ross in his iconic pose from 'The Joy of Painting' PBS television series. Ross wears light blue button-up shirt, stands beside easel holding wooden palette with paint colors in left hand, paintbrush in right hand. He has distinctive large curly afro hairstyle (dark brown), full beard, warm friendly smile. Background shows his painting studio with windows, white walls, painting supplies visible. On easel canvas displays painting of Earth from space - Blue Marble-style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents (appears to show North and South America). Painting looks photorealistic in style matching NASA Earth imagery. Upper left corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'LET'S JUST PAINT A FAKE LITTLE GLOBE IN THERE'. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Meme plays on Bob Ross's famous gentle phrases from his show ('happy little trees', 'happy little clouds') applying them to suggest NASA Earth images are literally paintings rather than photographs. Implies space agencies create artistic renderings and present them as authentic photos. Suggests deception - 'fake little globe' painted for propaganda purposes. However, Earth images come from multiple independent sources over 60+ years: Apollo missions, International Space Station, dozens of weather satellites, communications satellites, various nations' space programs (USA, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India), commercial satellites, astronauts from 40+ countries. Thousands of images from different angles, seasons, times, cameras all showing same spherical Earth. While some images are composites (multiple satellite passes stitched together) or enhanced for visibility, they're based on real photographic/sensor data, not paintings. Bob Ross himself would have appreciated actual beauty of Earth from space4:T832,Armed astronaut with conspiracy symbols suggesting NASA military connection. Composite image implying NASA is military operation rather than civilian space agency. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'DON'T FORGET...' Upper left shows three symbol images stacked vertically: American flag (red and white stripes, blue field with white stars), Freemason square and compass emblem (blue compass with gold/yellow square, letter 'G' in center on radiating blue star pattern), NASA logo (blue circular 'meatball' insignia with white NASA text, red chevron, white stars, orbital trajectory). Right side shows astronaut in full white spacesuit standing against cloudy gray-blue sky background. Astronaut wears reflective helmet visor (tinted dark/black), white Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) with American flag patch on shoulder, life support backpack, various hoses and equipment connections. Most striking element: astronaut holds what appears to be assault rifle or similar weapon across chest in tactical grip position - highly unusual imagery as astronauts don't carry firearms in space. Weapon appears to be AR-style rifle with scope/optics mounted. Lower left shows NASA logo again. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'NASA IS A BRANCH OF THE MILITARY'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Meme suggests conspiracy: NASA subordinate to military/Freemasonry rather than independent civilian agency. Implies space program serves military purposes, conceals true activities. Armed astronaut imagery suggests militarization of space, threat/enforcement role. Freemason symbol implies secret society control. However, NASA established 1958 as civilian agency under National Aeronautics and Space Act explicitly stating peaceful purposes. While NASA works with Department of Defense on some projects and many early astronauts were military pilots, agency operates under civilian government oversight with transparent budgets, public missions, international cooperation. Armed astronaut image is obviously fabricated composite - astronauts never carry weapons in space5:T896,Flat Earth map with Antarctica ice wall questioning what lies beyond. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with curiosity about unexplored regions. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline and blue 3D effect: 'WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS...' Image shows circular flat Earth map viewed from above with North Pole at center. Map displays continents in yellow-green color against dark navy blue ocean. White ice/snow covers Antarctic perimeter forming ring around entire edge. Visible landmasses include: North America on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe upper left, Asia across top and left, Australia lower left, Greenland near center. Geographic features show terrain texture with mountain ranges, plains visible in relief. Antarctica shown as thick white irregular band encircling entire map edge - much larger than actual continent. Center-left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in translucent text. Red oval circle drawn around large area of Southern Ocean/Antarctica region with small gray alien figure standing in center of oval holding red question mark above its head. Alien depicted in classic style - large head, big black eyes, small gray body, thin limbs. Bottom text in matching bold white letters with blue 3D effect: 'WHAT'S OVER HERE?' Text and alien placement suggests mystery about Antarctic regions, implying hidden lands, civilizations, or phenomena beyond ice wall in flat Earth model. Common flat Earth claim that Antarctica isn't continent but massive ice wall preventing access to whatever lies beyond (more land, edge of world, dome boundary). Treaty restrictions on Antarctic travel cited as evidence of cover-up. However, Antarctica is well-mapped continent (5.5 million sq mi, about twice size of Australia), explored extensively since 1820s. Thousands of scientists from dozens of nations work at research stations year-round. Antarctic Treaty (1961) protects continent for peaceful scientific research, prohibits military activity, allows anyone to visit with proper permits/logistics. Satellite imagery, aircraft surveys, ground expeditions confirm it's continent surrounded by ocean, not ice wall surrounding flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-298","title":"Other 298","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744462_466915816841491_4527401067199396542_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-297","title":"Other 297","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744346_468089603390779_1314065774518848703_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-299","title":"Other 299","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744465_467888163410923_8086078284972262480_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
