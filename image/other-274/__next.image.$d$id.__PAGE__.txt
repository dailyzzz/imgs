3:T819,Large azimuthal equidistant projection map displayed on urban building. Photograph showing massive world map displayed on exterior wall of multi-story building in city setting. Map uses azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole - same projection commonly used by flat Earth community. Map appears as large circular disc with white/cream border showing compass directions with decorative sun symbols at cardinal points. North Pole at center (white) with continents radiating outward. Africa prominently displayed in orange/brown tones center-left. Asia in yellow-green tones across upper portion. Europe visible in smaller scale. North and South America in green tones on right side. Australia in yellow-orange lower portion. Antarctica not shown as continent - outer ring represents Antarctic region. Map shows political boundaries with countries in different colors. Ocean areas in light blue. Latitude/longitude grid lines visible as black curves radiating from center and concentric circles. Map appears to be large advertisement, mural, or educational display mounted on concrete/glass building facade. Building shows modern architecture with visible windows, air conditioning units. Street level visible at bottom showing pedestrians walking on sidewalk - approximately 6-8 people visible as small figures giving scale to massive map (appears 30-40 feet in diameter). Yellow taxi cab motion-blurred in foreground driving past on street. Street lamp and traffic infrastructure visible. Background shows more urban buildings. Sky appears overcast/hazy typical of city atmosphere. Map projection is legitimate cartographic tool used for aviation and radio communication because it accurately shows distances from center point. United Nations logo uses this projection. However, flat Earth community adopted this specific projection as 'true' map of Earth, misunderstanding that it's 2D representation of 3D sphere, not actual Earth shape. Projection severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center - Australia, South America, Antarctica appear stretched4:T84d,Toy Story Buzz Lightyear gravitational waves detection meme. Popular internet meme format using characters from Pixar's Toy Story animated film franchise. Image shows Woody (left) and Buzz Lightyear (right) standing together. Woody is cowboy doll wearing brown cow-print vest, yellow shirt, blue jeans, red bandana, brown cowboy hat with sheriff badge. He has concerned skeptical expression with raised eyebrow looking at Buzz. Buzz Lightyear is space ranger action figure wearing white and green futuristic space suit with purple and red accents, purple hood/helmet, colorful control buttons on chest. Buzz stands with arms outstretched in his characteristic heroic pose pointing upward and outward with confident enthusiastic expression. Background shows blurred tan/beige desert landscape suggesting outdoor scene from film. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Bottom text in same style: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES EVERYWHERE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme references Buzz's famous line from Toy Story: 'X, X everywhere!' format (originally 'Lasers, lasers everywhere!' or fan-made 'X, X everywhere' variants). Format used to describe something that's suddenly everywhere or being over-applied. In this context, mocking 2016 announcement of gravitational waves detection by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's General Relativity, first directly detected September 2015 from merging black holes. Discovery won 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth community skeptical of gravitational waves since they: 1) require spacetime to exist (flat Earth models reject relativity), 2) confirm predictions of Einstein's gravity theory which flat Earthers dismiss, 3) detected by sophisticated instruments flat Earthers distrust. Meme suggests scientists invoke gravitational waves too frequently as explanation or that concept is being overused in media. However, gravitational wave astronomy is legitimate field with multiple confirmed detections opening new way to observe universe5:T849,Flat Earth cosmology electromagnetic spectrum diagram with sun and moon frequencies. Educational diagram showing visible light spectrum in context of flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Main section on black background divided into vertical colored bands representing rainbow spectrum from red to violet. Top row shows seven circles representing celestial bodies: Six labeled 'SUN' in gradually changing yellow-cream tones corresponding to color below, plus one labeled 'MOON' in white/pale yellow over purple band. Below circles, white section labeled 'FREQUENCY INTERVAL' lists specific frequencies: 480 THz (terahertz), 510 THz, 540 THz, 610 THz, 670 THz, 750 THz reading left to right under respective colors. Middle shows white waveform illustrations overlaid on spectrum demonstrating increasing frequency - waves become more compressed (shorter wavelength) moving left to right. Arrows indicate 'INCREASING ENERGY' pointing right and 'INCREASING WAVELENGTH' pointing left. Bottom dark section labeled 'WAVELENGTH INTERVAL' shows corresponding wavelengths: 635 nm (nanometers), 590 nm, 560 nm, 490 nm, 450 nm, 400 nm. Color bands progress: deep red/maroon (left), brown/orange, olive/yellow-green, bright green, cyan/turquoise, blue, deep blue/purple, violet (right). Lower beige border shows 'SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION'. Diagram attempts to connect sun's light to specific frequencies and wavelengths in flat Earth model, suggesting sun emits light at different frequencies that we perceive as colors. Also includes moon in spectrum implying moon generates its own light. However, scientifically: Sun emits broad continuous spectrum (blackbody radiation ~5778K) containing all visible wavelengths simultaneously, not discrete frequencies. Moon doesn't generate light - reflects sunlight. Listed frequencies/wavelengths are correct for visible spectrum (red ~700nm/430THz to violet ~400nm/750THz), but diagram misrepresents how sun and moon relate to spectrum. Real sun emits across entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, with peak in visible range0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-274","title":"Other 274","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717740_465255460340860_1563648932534546304_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-273","title":"Other 273","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717709_463444777188595_8211548813359873487_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-275","title":"Other 275","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717757_464902123709527_7235288575083781581_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
