5:T819,Large azimuthal equidistant projection map displayed on urban building. Photograph showing massive world map displayed on exterior wall of multi-story building in city setting. Map uses azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole - same projection commonly used by flat Earth community. Map appears as large circular disc with white/cream border showing compass directions with decorative sun symbols at cardinal points. North Pole at center (white) with continents radiating outward. Africa prominently displayed in orange/brown tones center-left. Asia in yellow-green tones across upper portion. Europe visible in smaller scale. North and South America in green tones on right side. Australia in yellow-orange lower portion. Antarctica not shown as continent - outer ring represents Antarctic region. Map shows political boundaries with countries in different colors. Ocean areas in light blue. Latitude/longitude grid lines visible as black curves radiating from center and concentric circles. Map appears to be large advertisement, mural, or educational display mounted on concrete/glass building facade. Building shows modern architecture with visible windows, air conditioning units. Street level visible at bottom showing pedestrians walking on sidewalk - approximately 6-8 people visible as small figures giving scale to massive map (appears 30-40 feet in diameter). Yellow taxi cab motion-blurred in foreground driving past on street. Street lamp and traffic infrastructure visible. Background shows more urban buildings. Sky appears overcast/hazy typical of city atmosphere. Map projection is legitimate cartographic tool used for aviation and radio communication because it accurately shows distances from center point. United Nations logo uses this projection. However, flat Earth community adopted this specific projection as 'true' map of Earth, misunderstanding that it's 2D representation of 3D sphere, not actual Earth shape. Projection severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center - Australia, South America, Antarctica appear stretched0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 274 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Large azimuthal equidistant projection map displayed on urban building.
