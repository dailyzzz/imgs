5:T614,Shrek donkey character with NASA etymology claiming Hebrew word for deception. Shows CGI character Donkey from Shrek animated films against dark brown-gray textured background. Donkey has gray-brown fur, large expressive eyes with yellow-green irises looking directly at camera with enthusiastic toothy grin showing prominent white teeth. Long gray ears pointed upward. Character wears white space suit or astronaut costume with visible American flag patches on shoulders showing stars and stripes. Background suggests indoor setting possibly spacecraft interior or space station. Upper left and upper right corners display identical NASA logos (blue circle with red chevron, white letters) with large red diagonal lines striking through logos. Red text overlaid on logos reads 'LIARS' in capital letters. Top center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Lower portion displays black text box with white text explaining: 'NASA: "nasha" in ancient Hebrew can also be spelled without the 'h'. It is pronounced naw-shaw, and means "a great deception" or "to deceive".' Below shows pink highlighted dictionary excerpt with Hebrew characters and definition: Strong's reference number 5377 showing 'nasha' verb meaning 'to deceive, greatly deceived, to deceive, deceive greatly, beguiled, seize, utterly forget'. Etymology argument claims NASA's name reveals its purpose as deception agency. However, NASA is acronym for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, not Hebrew word. Conspiracy theory uses linguistic coincidence to suggest intentional occult naming0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 254 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Shrek donkey character with NASA etymology claiming Hebrew word for deception.
