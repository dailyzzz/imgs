3:T614,Shrek donkey character with NASA etymology claiming Hebrew word for deception. Shows CGI character Donkey from Shrek animated films against dark brown-gray textured background. Donkey has gray-brown fur, large expressive eyes with yellow-green irises looking directly at camera with enthusiastic toothy grin showing prominent white teeth. Long gray ears pointed upward. Character wears white space suit or astronaut costume with visible American flag patches on shoulders showing stars and stripes. Background suggests indoor setting possibly spacecraft interior or space station. Upper left and upper right corners display identical NASA logos (blue circle with red chevron, white letters) with large red diagonal lines striking through logos. Red text overlaid on logos reads 'LIARS' in capital letters. Top center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Lower portion displays black text box with white text explaining: 'NASA: "nasha" in ancient Hebrew can also be spelled without the 'h'. It is pronounced naw-shaw, and means "a great deception" or "to deceive".' Below shows pink highlighted dictionary excerpt with Hebrew characters and definition: Strong's reference number 5377 showing 'nasha' verb meaning 'to deceive, greatly deceived, to deceive, deceive greatly, beguiled, seize, utterly forget'. Etymology argument claims NASA's name reveals its purpose as deception agency. However, NASA is acronym for National Aeronautics and Space Administration, not Hebrew word. Conspiracy theory uses linguistic coincidence to suggest intentional occult naming4:T5da,Antarctic ice shelf with false-color green terrain showing massive ice wall. Shows aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape with unusual green false-color processing. Left side and foreground dominated by bright green colored terrain representing ice shelf or Antarctic landmass - vivid lime-green to forest-green coloring creates striking artificial appearance. Green surface shows topographic features, slopes, undulations suggesting three-dimensional terrain. Center features massive white ice cliff or wall - sheer vertical face where ice shelf meets ocean or lower elevation. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Wall shows brilliant white coloring with blue-gray shadows and stratified layers visible. Some sections show irregular breaks where ice has calved. Right side and upper portion shows flat gray-white surface representing ocean, sea ice, or cloud cover extending to horizon. Surface appears uniform with slight texture. Far background displays snow-covered mountain peaks in pale blue-gray - two distinct peaks visible rising above horizon line. Sky shows light blue gradient suggesting clear polar conditions. No text or watermarks visible. Image processing likely uses satellite or aerial survey data with false-color to enhance terrain features. Green coloring helps differentiate ice elevation zones. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic ice imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter surrounding flat Earth disc5:T634,3D rendered globe Earth emerging from cardboard box with quote about generational lies. Shows photorealistic 3D illustration on white background. Center displays open brown cardboard shipping box with four flaps opened upward revealing contents. Box shows realistic texture with corrugated edges, tape residue, printed barcode and shipping label visible on side. Inside box sits translucent glowing blue globe Earth - semi-transparent sphere showing dark blue oceans, lighter blue-green continents (visible landmasses include parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas), white cloud patterns, and bright white-blue glowing light emanating from center creating dramatic illumination. Globe appears to float slightly above box bottom. Light rays project outward creating ethereal effect. Box casts soft shadow on white surface below. Right side of box shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline reads: 'WHEN A WELL-PACKAGED WEB OF LIES HAS BEEN SOLD GRADUALLY TO THE MASSES OVER GENERATIONS,' Bottom text in same style: 'THE TRUTH WILL SEEM UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS AND ITS SPEAKER A RAVING LUNATIC.' Quote often misattributed to George Orwell or other authors. Image suggests globe Earth model represents manufactured deception packaged and delivered to humanity over centuries through educational indoctrination. Implies truth-tellers are dismissed as crazy. Box symbolizes how worldview is pre-packaged commodity sold to consumers rather than discovered through independent investigation. Glowing effect suggests seductive appeal of false narrative0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-254","title":"Other 254","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705370_461439577389115_2275386566848647093_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-253","title":"Other 253","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698719_461770264022713_8561603609258010225_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-255","title":"Other 255","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705408_463496250516781_1766928751739367074_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
