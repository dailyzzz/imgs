5:T5fa,Training Day meme mocking gravitational waves discovery with Denzel Washington. Shows scene from Training Day (2001) film inside vehicle. Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris in driver's seat, wearing dark clothing. Has short hair, thin mustache and goatee, looking toward camera with skeptical questioning expression - eyebrows slightly raised, mouth open mid-speech. Hand visible gesturing. Background shows blurred vehicle interior with gray upholstery, window showing out-of-focus exterior with orange/tan and blue tones suggesting daytime street scene. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THEY TOLD YOU THEY FOUND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in white bold letters: 'AND YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?' References 2016 LIGO announcement of first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, confirming Einstein's century-old prediction. Flat Earth community dismisses gravitational waves as unverifiable theoretical physics rather than empirical science. Uses Denzel Washington's street-smart, skeptical character to question scientific establishment narratives. Training Day scene originally about exposing naivety. Meme suggests mainstream audience credulously accepts scientific announcements without understanding underlying theory or considering alternative explanations. Implies gravitational wave detection could be fabricated data or misinterpreted instrument noise rather than genuine cosmic phenomenon0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 246 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Training Day meme mocking gravitational waves discovery with Denzel Washington.
