3:T5fa,Training Day meme mocking gravitational waves discovery with Denzel Washington. Shows scene from Training Day (2001) film inside vehicle. Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris in driver's seat, wearing dark clothing. Has short hair, thin mustache and goatee, looking toward camera with skeptical questioning expression - eyebrows slightly raised, mouth open mid-speech. Hand visible gesturing. Background shows blurred vehicle interior with gray upholstery, window showing out-of-focus exterior with orange/tan and blue tones suggesting daytime street scene. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THEY TOLD YOU THEY FOUND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in white bold letters: 'AND YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?' References 2016 LIGO announcement of first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, confirming Einstein's century-old prediction. Flat Earth community dismisses gravitational waves as unverifiable theoretical physics rather than empirical science. Uses Denzel Washington's street-smart, skeptical character to question scientific establishment narratives. Training Day scene originally about exposing naivety. Meme suggests mainstream audience credulously accepts scientific announcements without understanding underlying theory or considering alternative explanations. Implies gravitational wave detection could be fabricated data or misinterpreted instrument noise rather than genuine cosmic phenomenon4:T58c,Antarctic ice shelf formation with massive vertical ice walls and sea ice. Shows dramatic aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape from elevated perspective. Left and center dominated by massive tabular ice shelf with sheer vertical ice cliffs or walls. Ice cliff appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image, showing pristine white-blue ice with stratified layers visible in face. Wall shows irregular geometric breaks and sections where ice has fractured or calved. Top surface of shelf appears flat extending into distance. Right side and foreground shows dark navy-blue ocean water with scattered white ice fragments, brash ice, and small icebergs floating on surface. Water shows ripple patterns and darker patches. Middle distance shows larger white ice floes and tabular icebergs in various sizes scattered across water. Far background displays distant Antarctic ice formations or mountains with flat-topped profiles. Sky shows light gray-blue overcast conditions typical of polar regions with horizontal cloud layers. Horizon line visible in far distance. No text or watermarks. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual evidence of Antarctic 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing water from flowing off edges and restricting access to regions beyond Antarctica. Antarctic Treaty cited as conspiracy to prevent exploration5:T63b,Antarctic tabular ice shelf with geometric cliff faces meeting dark ocean. Shows stunning aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf from elevated viewpoint. Lower right foreground displays pristine white snow-covered ice shelf surface extending across bottom of frame - flat geometric plane with slight undulations and surface textures visible. Most dramatic feature is massive vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets ocean - clean straight edge running across image showing sheer drop from flat top surface to water level. Ice cliff appears 50-100 feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified horizontal layers of compressed ice and snow in brilliant white and pale blue bands. Wall face shows some irregularities, cracks, overhangs, and icicle-like formations along edge where ice has partially calved. Left side and upper portion shows dark teal-blue ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, and small white icebergs floating on surface creating textured pattern. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast against bright white ice. Middle distance shows larger tabular icebergs and ice floes in various sizes. Far background displays distant ice shelf formations extending to horizon. Sky shows light blue-gray gradient suggesting overcast polar conditions. Bottom left corner shows 'www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk' watermark indicating British Antarctic Survey photography. No other text visible. Professional nature documentation. Image used by flat Earth proponents as visual representation of alleged Antarctic ice wall surrounding flat Earth disc perimeter0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-246","title":"Other 246","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697225_465616066971466_1180502624568548152_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-245","title":"Other 245","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688331_461770127356060_1783774617165432927_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-247","title":"Other 247","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697381_461770147356058_5884868133883643800_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
