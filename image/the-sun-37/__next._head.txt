Bridge visible in background with crew member. Pink text at top reads 'the sun is 70% helium' and bottom text asks 'how does it generate gravity'. Questions how sun can have gravitational pull if composed primarily of helium, a very light gas that floats in Earth's atmosphere. Argues that helium's low density and buoyant properties on Earth contradict sun's supposed massive gravitational influence holding planets in orbit. Challenges mainstream solar physics claim that sun is ~73% hydrogen and ~25% helium by mass, questioning how gaseous composition creates gravity. Ignores that gravity depends on total mass regardless of composition, and that sun's enormous mass (despite being mostly light elements) creates immense gravitational field.
