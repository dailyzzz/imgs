Bridge visible in background with crew member. Pink text at top reads 'the sun is 70% helium' and bottom text asks 'how does it generate gravity'. Questions how sun can have gravitational pull if composed primarily of helium, a very light gas that floats in Earth's atmosphere. Argues that helium's low density and buoyant properties on Earth contradict sun's supposed massive gravitational influence holding planets in orbit. Challenges mainstream solar physics claim that sun is ~73% hydrogen and ~25% helium by mass, questioning how gaseous composition creates gravity. Ignores that gravity depends on total mass regardless of composition, and that sun's enormous mass (despite being mostly light elements) creates immense gravitational field.

Shows black and white illustration of man in business attire looking contemplative with hand on chin. Large yellow sun with radiating rays shown on left side. Speech bubble asks 'What if the Sun actually moves across the sky exactly as it appears to do?' Humorous commentary on questioning heliocentric model by taking sun's apparent motion at face value. Suggests person beginning to question mainstream cosmology by observing sun's obvious east-to-west movement across sky and considering possibility that visual observation (sun moving) is accurate rather than learned explanation (Earth rotating while sun remains stationary). Presents geocentric/flat Earth perspective as common-sense observation versus counter-intuitive heliocentric teaching. Comic format lampoons those who begin questioning established scientific models"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-38","title":"The Sun 38","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/e067990b4cb5a06927d4783186f85375.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme about sun's apparent size change during sunset. Top panel shows sunset over ocean with bright white-yellow sun relatively high above reddish-orange horizon, appearing larger. White text states 'It is impossible for the Sun to appear to change in size if the Sun is millions of miles away.' Small 'PW' logo in corner with text 'This is your wake up call.' Bottom panel shows later sunset moment with sun appearing as smaller red-orange semicircle touching darker horizon line. White text explains 'The Sun is smaller than we've been told. The Sun traverses above Earth, illuminating locally.' with 'Don't go back to sleep! you know this is true. Research Flat Earth.' Argues that observable change in sun's angular size from high sun to setting sun proves sun is close and moving away horizontally rather than distant sun being viewed through increasing atmospheric thickness. Uses apparent size variation as evidence for local sun model over heliocentric distant sun"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
