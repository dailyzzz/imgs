3:T5a0,Halloween skeleton decorations meme about waiting for globe Earth proof. Shows exterior daytime photograph of gray-blue house with white trim. Wooden steps/stairs leading up to doorway entrance with screen door. Multiple plastic Halloween skeleton decorations arranged on and around stairs in various waiting poses. Approximately 8-10 realistic-looking beige-white skeleton figures positioned as if sitting, standing, leaning against railings and walls in patient, bored poses. One skeleton sits hunched over on steps, another stands with arms raised, several lean against white wooden railing and siding. Green foliage/trees visible left side. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'FLATEARTHERS WAITING FOR PROOF'. Center shows small 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT WE LIVE ON A SPINNING BALL'. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Self-aware humor from flat Earth community acknowledging mainstream perception that they're stubbornly waiting for impossible proof. Skeleton imagery suggests they've been waiting so long they've died and decomposed - represents endless wait. Ironically reverses burden of proof argument - while mainstream science has provided extensive evidence for spherical rotating Earth, flat Earthers claim they're still waiting for satisfactory proof. Suggests no amount of evidence will convince them. Humor disarms criticism by embracing the waiting skeleton metaphor4:T590,Satirical NASA parody collage with Neil deGrasse Tyson in cosmic setting. Shows complex composite image mocking space science establishment. Background displays vibrant nebula space scene with purple-pink-orange clouds, stars, galaxies. Upper left corner shows NASA logo parody - blue circular badge with red swoosh replaced by word 'LIARS' in red text. Center shows woman (likely science educator or Neil deGrasse Tyson in context) with dark curly hair, brown skin, wearing sparkly dark sleeveless vest/top, looking down at hands as if manipulating objects. Multiple celestial bodies float around her as if she's arranging props: photorealistic Earth globe showing Americas, gray Moon, tan Mars-like planet with cartoon ram/Aries symbol face and rainbow vomit, blue Neptune-like planet. Lower portion shows two astronauts in white NASA spacesuits with American flag patches and mission badges. Left astronaut holds sign reading 'It's all FAKE'. Right astronaut visible in typical EVA spacesuit. Bottom displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature. Image satirizes mainstream space science by suggesting space exploration is theatrical production with Neil deGrasse Tyson as stage manager arranging props. Astronaut's 'It's all FAKE' sign explicitly states moon landing hoax belief. Portrays cosmos as artificial set pieces that can be moved by hand rather than massive distant celestial bodies5:T590,Neil deGrasse Tyson meme with 'pear-anoia' pun about Earth's shape. Shows Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and science communicator, in professional portrait against plain gray-green gradient background. Tyson wears dark navy blue suit jacket, light blue dress shirt, dark blue tie with small pattern or planets/stars design. Has characteristic wide friendly smile showing teeth, short dark hair with gray at sides, thin mustache. Both hands raised toward camera with palms facing outward in emphatic gesture or stop motion. Gold ring visible on finger. Body language suggests enthusiastic explanation or demonstration. Translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark visible across chest area. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'PEAR-ANOIA WILL DESTROYA'. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature watermark. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is not perfect sphere but actually 'pear-shaped' or 'oblate spheroid' - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator. Flat Earth community mocked this statement, claiming it shows inconsistency in official narrative (sometimes sphere, sometimes pear, sometimes oblate spheroid). Pun combines 'pear' + 'paranoia' suggesting Tyson's pear-shaped Earth claims will ultimately destroy credibility of mainstream astronomy. Word 'destroya' suggests Tyson's own statements undermine the globe Earth model through contradictions and overcomplications0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-211","title":"Other 211","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633746_460550940811312_5807645605894336062_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-210","title":"Other 210","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633729_458255607707512_7478934796738001520_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-212","title":"Other 212","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12640333_458537694345970_2693304563078920792_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
