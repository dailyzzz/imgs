Header 'YOU ARE HERE' in yellow with '\"SAYS HELIOCENTRISM\"' below. Shows physical orrery model with yellow sun sphere at center and brown/tan planetary spheres. White text explains: 'Interesting... According to this scale, The Sun's light from 93 million miles away would hit this tiny spec of a dot all at once It doesn't matter if you tilt the dot 23° or if you turned it 90° on its side.. There would be NO seasons and not even a temperature difference from anywhere' followed by emoji figures and 'on the Earth.' Questions how distant sun could create seasonal temperature variations and different climate zones on small Earth if sunlight arrives essentially parallel from such distance. Argues scaled model demonstrates impossibility of axial tilt creating seasons when sun is 93 million miles away, suggesting heliocentric model physics don't work at stated distances"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-31","title":"The Sun 31","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/41205973_2131776966832606_8989119894851158016_n.jpeg","description":"Educational meme about perspective using sunset ocean photograph with perspective grid overlay. Top text reads 'IMAGINARY GRAPHICAL LINES ASSIST US WHEN VISUALIZING TRUE PERSPECTIVE.' and 'SEE THE SUN'S STRAIGHT LINE REFLECTION ON THE OCEAN.?' Shows sunset over ocean with bright sun at horizon creating golden reflection path across water. White perspective grid lines overlaid on lower half showing vanishing point convergence toward sun/horizon. Layered clouds in orange, pink, and blue tones. Bottom text states 'IT CONFIRMS THE NATURAL PHYSICS OF WATER IS TO FIND AND MAINTAIN ITS LEVEL.' Concluding text 'FLAT EARTH IS REALITY! WAKE UP!' Uses perspective grid to demonstrate how straight sun reflection and flat-appearing ocean horizon suggest flat Earth and level water.

Top section shows gradient background from yellow (left) to orange/black (right) with bright yellow sun rays emanating from left side. Text reads 'IF THE SUN IS 93 MILLION MILES AWAY AND THE LIGHT TRAVELS THE WHOLE DISTANCE'. Small Earth sphere shown on right with long black shadow cone extending rightward. Bottom section states 'DOESN'T THE LIGHT TRAVEL PAST EARTH ALSO AND WOULDN'T WE SEE WALLS OF LIGHT 360° AROUND OUR NIGHT HORIZON?' Questions why night sky is dark if sunlight travels past Earth continuously. Argues that if sun's light travels 93 million miles to reach Earth, light should continue past Earth illuminating space behind it, creating visible light walls around entire night horizon. Challenges heliocentric explanation of day/night cycle by suggesting light rays should be visible from all angles if traveling through space"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
