Bottom text states 'IT CONFIRMS THE NATURAL PHYSICS OF WATER IS TO FIND AND MAINTAIN ITS LEVEL.' Concluding text 'FLAT EARTH IS REALITY! WAKE UP!'

Bottom section states 'DOESN'T THE LIGHT TRAVEL PAST EARTH ALSO AND WOULDN'T WE SEE WALLS OF LIGHT 360° AROUND OUR NIGHT HORIZON?' Questions why night sky is dark if sunlight travels past Earth continuously. Argues that if sun's light travels 93 million miles to reach Earth, light should continue past Earth illuminating space behind it, creating visible light walls around entire night horizon. Challenges heliocentric explanation of day/night cycle by suggesting light rays should be visible from all angles if traveling through space"}}]
