3:T4f1,Two-row comparison showing evolution of Earth photographs with color inconsistencies. Black background with four spherical Earth images across timeline. Top row shows original images: 1967 - Single image from ATS3 Satellite in geostationary orbit 22,197 miles above Earth, showing greenish-teal tones with white clouds and brown landmasses. 1972 - Single image from Apollo 17 lunar mission 28,000 miles above Earth (famous 'Blue Marble'), showing deep blue oceans with white cloud swirls. 2002 - Composite image taken over 8 days from Terra satellite 443 miles above Earth, showing bright blue oceans with green continents. 2015 - Single image from DSCOVR Satellite at L1 point 930,000 miles above Earth, showing pale blue-gray tones. Middle text reads 'Adjusting Color and Contrast Randomly'. Bottom row shows same four images with dramatically altered color grading - 1967 appears more neutral gray-green, 1972 shows enhanced deep blue, 2002 appears more gray-brown, 2015 shows vivid saturated blue. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Questions why official NASA Earth photographs from different missions, satellites, and distances show such dramatic color variations, suggesting inconsistent post-processing or manipulation rather than accurate representations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-116","title":"Other 116","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10400529_469035413296198_2794825867189002207_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-115","title":"Other 115","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10399379_466516020214804_2304525427413536251_n.jpg","description":"Skeptical Robert Downey Jr. meme showing actor in dark suit and polka dot tie with arms crossed, making dubious facial expression with raised eyebrow and slight smirk. Brown/maroon background. Image captures Tony Stark/Iron Man actor's trademark sardonic look of disbelief. Top text in white bold letters: 'THE FACE YOU MAKE'. Bottom text: 'WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' with 'JM' logo. Popular meme format expressing skepticism toward claims of personally observing Earth's curvature from commercial airplanes or high altitude. Suggests such claims are either mistaken, exaggerated, or dishonest since curvature requires much higher altitude than passenger flights to be visible. Uses Downey Jr.'s incredulous expression to convey doubt about everyday curvature sightings, implying horizon always appears flat to human observers at accessible altitudes"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-117","title":"Other 117","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10553688_476632929203113_6327190001766255859_o.jpg","description":"Humorous two-panel comparison meme with bright blue banner reading 'THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF PEOPLE'. Left panel shows hands holding inflatable globe ball toy properly inflated, showing spherical Earth with colorful countries (pink, yellow, green, orange) on blue oceans with latitude/longitude grid lines visible. Label in green italic text: 'Ball-ievers'. Right panel shows same hands squeezing/deflating the globe ball, causing it to crumple and distort with wrinkled surface, demonstrating globe is flexible inflatable toy. Label in green italic text: 'Ball Leavers'. Top center shows 'fb.com/fematters' and 'Nick Havok' credit. Visual pun on 'believers' vs 'leavers' combined with 'ball' to create 'Ball-ievers' (those who believe in globe/ball Earth) versus 'Ball Leavers' (those who leave/reject ball Earth concept). Uses deflatable toy globe to suggest spherical Earth model is as insubstantial and easily collapsed as cheap inflatable toy"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
