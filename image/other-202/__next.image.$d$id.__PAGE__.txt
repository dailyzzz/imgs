3:T646,Aerial photograph of K2 mountain casting enormous shadow across China. Shows stunning high-altitude view of Karakoram mountain range at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from pale blue-white upper atmosphere to warm peachy-orange glow at horizon with scattered white-pink clouds. Center shows massive snow-covered mountain peak (K2, second-highest peak on Earth at 28,251 feet) with dramatic triangular shadow projection extending hundreds of miles into distance. Shadow appears as dark gray-blue triangular cone stretching from mountain base across landscape. Foreground shows jagged snow-covered peaks and ridges in white and gray. Mountains show striated rock faces, glacial formations, steep slopes covered in ice and snow. Distant landscape shows hazy atmospheric perspective with multiple mountain ranges fading into bluish distance. Top left displays 'fb.com/fematters' URL. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'SHADOW OF K2 PROJECTED INTO CHINA OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES'. Flat Earth proponents cite this image as evidence of local sun creating crepuscular rays (sun rays) rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Argues if sun were truly distant, shadows should be parallel, but visible convergence of shadow suggests sun is close and small. Similar logic applied to sun rays breaking through clouds - rays appear to converge at focal point suggesting nearby source. Mainstream science explains this as perspective effect - parallel lines appear to converge at vanishing point due to observer's viewpoint, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon4:T68b,Academic paper excerpt questioning geocentric cosmology through quasar redshift analysis. White background with black text showing first page of scholarly article. Title in bold capitals: 'THE RED SHIFT HYPOTHESIS FOR QUASARS: IS THE EARTH THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE?' Author listed as 'Y. P. VARSHNI' from 'Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Canada'. Date stamp '(Received 10 September, 1975)' below author. Abstract section discusses cosmological interpretation of quasar redshift spectra leading to paradoxical result that Earth is center of Universe. Text mentions Einstein's criteria for good theory - external confirmation and inner perfection or 'logical simplicity' or 'naturalness'. Quote attributed to 'G. Holton (1973)'. Main body discusses G. Burbidge (1968) pointing out absorption-line red shifts at specific values (1.95, 1.55). Mentions four quasars (Ton 153, PKS 0119-04, PHL 938, 3C 232) whose emission-line red shifts cluster around 1.955. Discusses probability calculations for chance coincidence of four emission-line red shifts at 1.955. Includes mathematical equation labeled (1) for probability calculation.

This paper explores whether quasar redshift data paradoxically suggests special position for Earth, challenging cosmological principle that Universe appears same from all locations5:T723,Historical scientific text excerpt discussing alternative gravity theory and curved space. Shows dense paragraph of black text on white/cream background, appears to be from older printed book or journal. Text discusses author's discoveries related to force and motion of celestial bodies. Opening line: 'During the succeeding two years of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far-reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon.' Explains theory of force causing motion of heavenly bodies under its influence. References 'kinetic idea' and 'curved space' concepts similar to relativistic theory. Describes gravitational equivalence or resemblance to reality with 'self-contradictory' aspects. Discusses how 'curved spaces must react on the bodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves.' Mentions action and reaction becoming eccentric, questioning if proposed solution is impossible. States 'Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed. Only this can explain the working of the universe without recognizing the existence of any other unexplainable function or plays in the phenomena.' Second paragraph discusses 'physical truth of the greatest importance' - 'there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.' References birthday on July 10. Mentions applying concepts 'rigorously to molecules and atoms' as well as 'largest heavenly bodies'. Discusses energy in matter drawn from environment. References radioactivity discovery in 1896 and search for external agent.
