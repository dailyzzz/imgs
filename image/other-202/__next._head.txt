5:T646,Aerial photograph of K2 mountain casting enormous shadow across China. Shows stunning high-altitude view of Karakoram mountain range at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from pale blue-white upper atmosphere to warm peachy-orange glow at horizon with scattered white-pink clouds. Center shows massive snow-covered mountain peak (K2, second-highest peak on Earth at 28,251 feet) with dramatic triangular shadow projection extending hundreds of miles into distance. Shadow appears as dark gray-blue triangular cone stretching from mountain base across landscape. Foreground shows jagged snow-covered peaks and ridges in white and gray. Mountains show striated rock faces, glacial formations, steep slopes covered in ice and snow. Distant landscape shows hazy atmospheric perspective with multiple mountain ranges fading into bluish distance. Top left displays 'fb.com/fematters' URL. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'SHADOW OF K2 PROJECTED INTO CHINA OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES'. Flat Earth proponents cite this image as evidence of local sun creating crepuscular rays (sun rays) rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Argues if sun were truly distant, shadows should be parallel, but visible convergence of shadow suggests sun is close and small. Similar logic applied to sun rays breaking through clouds - rays appear to converge at focal point suggesting nearby source. Mainstream science explains this as perspective effect - parallel lines appear to converge at vanishing point due to observer's viewpoint, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 202 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Aerial photograph of K2 mountain casting enormous shadow across China.
