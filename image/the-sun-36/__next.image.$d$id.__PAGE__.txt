3:T551,Educational meme about inverse-square law titled 'INVERSE-SQUARE LAW' with yellow borders. Top left explains: 'As light radiates from a point source, the intensity of light (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) from the source. I ~ (1/r²)' followed by 'As intensity is the power per unit area (W/m²), it naturally decreases with the square of the distance as the size of the radiative spherical wavefront increases with distance.' Includes diagram showing light rays spreading from point source through expanding grid frames illustrating inverse-square relationship. Top right shows photograph of person with flashlight in dark forest, beam creating bright cone of light with intensity decreasing with distance. Bottom row shows four sunset photographs labeled 'THE SUN', 'IS NOT', '93 MILLION', 'MILES AWAY' featuring dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through clouds in various configurations. Bottom left shows day/night side-by-side comparison. Large bottom section shows row of light bulbs at increasing distances (6in/15cm through 48in/122cm) demonstrating light intensity falloff. Bottom text 'ALL LIGHT HAS RANGE'. Argues visible light intensity falloff in flashlight and sunset rays proves sun must be local/nearby rather than 93 million miles away, applying inverse-square law to challenge astronomical distances0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-36","title":"The Sun 36","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/91721711_1274841116048530_1257494685430054912_n.jpeg","description":"Comic-style meme titled 'THE ADVENTURES OF THE GUY WHO JUST STARTED PAYING ATTENTION' in green and blue lettering. Shows black and white illustration of man in business attire looking contemplative with hand on chin. Large yellow sun with radiating rays shown on left side. Speech bubble asks 'What if the Sun actually moves across the sky exactly as it appears to do?' Humorous commentary on questioning heliocentric model by taking sun's apparent motion at face value. Suggests person beginning to question mainstream cosmology by observing sun's obvious east-to-west movement across sky and considering possibility that visual observation (sun moving) is accurate rather than learned explanation (Earth rotating while sun remains stationary). Presents geocentric/flat Earth perspective as common-sense observation versus counter-intuitive heliocentric teaching. Comic format lampoons those who begin questioning established scientific models"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-35","title":"The Sun 35","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/82996658_2585948888318121_7527621048909430784_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-37","title":"The Sun 37","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/Flat-Earth-Memes-417-14.jpeg","description":"Star Trek meme featuring Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) from The Next Generation pointing forward in command pose wearing red Starfleet uniform. Bridge visible in background with crew member. Pink text at top reads 'the sun is 70% helium' and bottom text asks 'how does it generate gravity'. Questions how sun can have gravitational pull if composed primarily of helium, a very light gas that floats in Earth's atmosphere. Argues that helium's low density and buoyant properties on Earth contradict sun's supposed massive gravitational influence holding planets in orbit. Challenges mainstream solar physics claim that sun is ~73% hydrogen and ~25% helium by mass, questioning how gaseous composition creates gravity. Ignores that gravity depends on total mass regardless of composition, and that sun's enormous mass (despite being mostly light elements) creates immense gravitational field.
