Shows black and white illustration of man in business attire looking contemplative with hand on chin. Large yellow sun with radiating rays shown on left side. Speech bubble asks 'What if the Sun actually moves across the sky exactly as it appears to do?' Humorous commentary on questioning heliocentric model by taking sun's apparent motion at face value. Suggests person beginning to question mainstream cosmology by observing sun's obvious east-to-west movement across sky and considering possibility that visual observation (sun moving) is accurate rather than learned explanation (Earth rotating while sun remains stationary). Presents geocentric/flat Earth perspective as common-sense observation versus counter-intuitive heliocentric teaching.
