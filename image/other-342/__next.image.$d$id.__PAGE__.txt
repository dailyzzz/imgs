3:T1199,High-altitude photograph mocking curvature observations with toy rocket and insult. Image shows stratospheric view with toy rocket figurine superimposed against dramatic high-altitude sky and Earth below. Upper portion displays deep blue gradient sky transitioning from dark blue-purple at top to lighter blue-white toward horizon - characteristic of upper atmosphere/stratosphere where air thins. Sky shows subtle gradient indicating altitude between troposphere and space. Horizon line visible cutting across middle of frame shows gentle curve from left to right - actual Earth's curvature visible at high altitude. Below horizon shows Earth's surface - appears as layer of white clouds creating textured blanket covering ground below. Clouds show three-dimensional depth with shadows and highlights. Curvature of horizon is noticeable though subtle, consistent with photographs taken from high-altitude balloons or aircraft at 60,000-100,000+ feet altitude. Center of frame shows toy rocket model - appears to be plastic children's toy or model rocket approximately 6-12 inches tall positioned to appear as if "launching" upward through atmosphere. Rocket design: white cylindrical fuselage/body with clear or translucent dome at top (payload section or nosecone), red/maroon colored base section (likely representing engine/propellant section), wide stabilizing fins extending from base in tripod configuration (three fins visible). Rocket positioned vertically with nose pointing upward. Toy appears held or suspended in front of camera at close range while background shows actual high-altitude view - classic forced perspective technique. Scale of toy versus background creates impossible scene as if tiny toy has reached edge of space. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "IF YOU THINK YOU SEE A CURVE" - directly addressing viewer who might observe Earth's curvature in image. Bottom text in matching style: "THEN YOU JUST WENT FULL POTATO" - internet slang insult derived from "went full retard" phrase from 2008 film "Tropic Thunder" where character says "never go full retard." "Potato" substituted as less offensive version meaning acting extremely stupid or having brain like potato. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Meme's intention is mocking people who claim to see Earth's curvature in high-altitude photographs, suggesting they're idiots whose eyes deceive them. However, image contains ironic self-contradiction: photograph DOES actually show Earth's curvature - horizon displays gentle arc consistent with viewing spherical planet from high altitude. Curvature becomes visible to human eye at altitudes above approximately 35,000 feet (commercial aircraft cruising altitude), though subtle. Becomes more pronounced at 60,000-100,000+ feet (high-altitude balloon range). This image appears to be from such altitude based on darkness of sky, visible horizon arc, and cloud layer below. Scientific fact: Earth's curvature is real and measurable. Horizon dip and curve can be calculated geometrically based on observer altitude and Earth's radius (3,959 miles). From sea level, horizon appears flat because observer sees only ~3 miles to horizon (based on 6-foot observer height) - too small to detect curvature. As altitude increases, visible horizon extends farther and curvature becomes apparent. Amateur high-altitude balloon launches regularly photograph Earth from 100,000+ feet showing clear curvature. Felix Baumgartner's 2012 Red Bull Stratos jump from 128,100 feet showed pronounced curvature. Meme attempts to gaslight viewers into disbelieving their own observations by ridiculing curvature perception. Strategy suggests: 1) Curvature in photos is optical illusion or lens distortion (fish-eye effect), 2) Anyone claiming to see curvature is gullible fool, 3) Horizon is actually flat as shown by "true" observations. However, while extreme fish-eye lenses do exaggerate curvature, standard lenses at sufficient altitude show real gentle curvature matching mathematical predictions for spherical Earth. Toy rocket inclusion adds dismissive mockery - suggesting space exploration itself is childish fantasy like toy rockets. Combining actual curvature evidence with insult creates cognitive dissonance: image proves what text denies. Effectiveness depends on viewer's existing beliefs - flat Earth believers see it as mockery of globe believers; mainstream viewers see self-defeating argument undermined by own evidence.4:T1156,"They Live" meme format revealing "truth" about flat Earth using special sunglasses concept. Four-panel grid meme adapting iconic 1988 John Carpenter film "They Live" where protagonist discovers special sunglasses revealing hidden messages and alien infiltration invisible to normal vision. Format became popular template for conspiracy theories suggesting hidden truths visible only to awakened individuals. Top left panel shows man (appears to be from "They Live" film - Roddy Piper's character "Nada") with light brown/blonde mullet hairstyle wearing green and black plaid flannel shirt, pulling sunglasses down slightly to peer over top of frames with skeptical suspicious expression. Eyes narrowed, eyebrows furrowed. Interior setting with bookshelves, magazines, papers visible in background suggesting library or bookstore. Natural lighting from side. Top right panel shows black background with white text at top: "YOU LIVE ON A SPINNING BALL". Below text displays photograph of Earth from space - classic "Blue Marble" style image showing full sphere with blue oceans, white cloud formations, green-brown continents clearly visible. Earth appears as globe floating in black space. This represents "normal" view that mainstream society accepts. Bottom left panel shows same man now fully wearing large black sunglasses covering eyes completely. Same plaid shirt and bookshelf background. Expression more serious/determined. Sunglasses represent "seeing the truth" - special vision that penetrates propaganda. In "They Live" film, glasses revealed subliminal messages like "OBEY" and "CONSUME" hidden in media/advertising. Here, metaphorically represents awakening to flat Earth "truth." Bottom right panel shows black background with white text at top: "THE EARTH IS FLAT AND STATIONARY". Below displays azimuthal equidistant projection map (Gleason's map) - circular flat Earth representation with North Pole at center, continents arranged radially outward, Antarctica as ice ring around outer edge. Map shows gridlines creating concentric circles and radial lines. Continents appear in tan/beige, oceans in blue-teal. This represents "hidden truth" supposedly revealed when viewing world through "awakened" lens. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Meme's message: without special insight (sunglasses), people see/believe Earth is spinning globe as taught by establishment. With awakened vision/critical thinking (putting on glasses), "truth" reveals Earth is actually flat stationary plane. Implies: 1) Globe Earth is illusion/propaganda maintained by media/education/government, 2) Flat Earth is objective reality hidden from masses, 3) Only those who "wake up" and question mainstream narratives can see truth, 4) Flat Earth believers are like "They Live" protagonist - enlightened minority who see through deception. Format highly effective in conspiracy communities because it: 1) Frames belief as special knowledge/vision, 2) Positions believers as enlightened heroes, 3) Suggests mainstream view is programmed false reality, 4) Uses familiar pop culture reference making message accessible/shareable. However, comparison to fiction film is ironic - "They Live" was science fiction satire, not documentary. Earth's sphericity isn't hidden truth requiring special vision - observable through direct experiments anyone can perform: watching ships disappear hull-first over horizon, observing different star constellations in different hemispheres, witnessing lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow on moon, measuring stick shadows at different latitudes (Eratosthenes experiment), circumnavigating globe. "Spinning ball" description technically accurate: Earth rotates 360° every 24 hours (15°/hour), orbits sun at 67,000 mph. Motion imperceptible because it's constant velocity without acceleration. Meme's rhetorical power comes from emotional appeal rather than evidence - feeling of being enlightened elite who sees "truth" masses cannot. "They Live" format particularly popular in conspiracy communities for topics like fake moon landings, chemtrails, 9/11 theories, COVID conspiracies - anything suggesting mainstream reality is fabricated illusion. Film's anti-establishment, anti-authority themes resonate with conspiracy worldview. Original film was actually Reagan-era critique of consumerism and conformity, but has been adopted by various movements as metaphor for their particular "hidden truths."5:T11f6,"Real eyes realize real lies" conspiracy wordplay meme with globe Earth reflected in human eye. Artistic photograph showing extreme close-up of human eye with spherical Earth reflected in pupil/iris. Image uses selective color technique - entire photograph in black and white grayscale except Earth reflection which appears in full color. Creates dramatic striking visual isolating Earth as focal point. Eye dominates frame - fills most of image showing detailed structure. Visible anatomy includes: thick black eyelashes in top left and bottom right corners framing eye, upper eyelid edge visible at top with fine wrinkles/texture in monochrome, lower eyelid barely visible at bottom. Iris shows detailed circular muscle structure radiating from pupil with intricate patterns resembling starburst - darker gray tones with lighter striations creating texture. Pupil at center appears black in natural eye but contains colorized Earth reflection. Pupil shows photographic image of Earth from space - blue marble view showing spherical planet with blue oceans (deep navy/royal blue), white cloud swirls, green-brown continental landmasses. Earth appears as perfect sphere reflecting in curved surface of eye's lens. Reflection creates nested spheres - spherical Earth within spherical eyeball within spherical iris. Cornea surface shows slight glossy highlight/catchlight suggesting light source from above or front. Sclera (white of eye) visible minimally at edges appears grayish in monochrome treatment. Skin texture around eye visible showing pores, fine lines, natural texture all in grayscale. Image creates powerful metaphor: Earth/world as seen/perceived by individual is reflected in their eye - what you see is what you believe. Text overlays in large bold white letters with black outlines for readability: top of image reads "REAL EYES REALIZE" in all caps, bottom reads "REAL LIES" in all caps. Together forms wordplay aphorism: "REAL EYES REALIZE REAL LIES" - homophone pun where "REAL EYES" sounds like "REALIZE" and connects to "REAL LIES." Message operates on multiple levels: 1) Only authentic vision ("real eyes") can understand ("realize") genuine deceptions ("real lies"), 2) Those who truly see/observe with clarity can recognize falsehoods others miss, 3) Globe Earth visible in eye is one of "real lies" - major deception accepted as reality. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Phrase "real eyes realize real lies" is popular in conspiracy theory communities, truth-seeker movements, and pseudo-philosophical social media posts. Used across many conspiracy topics beyond flat Earth - government coverups, false flags, media manipulation, corporate deception. In flat Earth context specifically, meme suggests: globe Earth image literally reflected in human eye/consciousness is lie planted by education/media/NASA. What masses "see" (globe Earth) is programmed illusion rather than objective observation. True enlightened vision ("real eyes") allows one to "realize" (understand/awaken to) the "real lies" (fundamental deceptions like globe Earth). Image structure reinforces message - Earth appears as reflection, not actual object. Reflections are secondary images, not reality itself. Suggests globe Earth is mere reflection/illusion/representation rather than actual shape of world. Selective color draws eye to Earth while rest remains monochrome, emphasizing Earth as "false color" or artificial construct standing out from natural vision. However, meme's logic is self-defeating: if Earth reflection in eye is "real lie," image proves eyes DO show spherical Earth - exactly what science claims. Photograph demonstrates globe Earth is literally what eyes see/reflect when viewing space photography. Scientific reality: Earth's sphericity isn't belief or interpretation - it's directly observable fact verified through navigation, satellite imagery, physics, and personal observation experiments. Every photo from sufficient altitude shows curved horizon. Ships disappear hull-first over horizon. Different stars visible from different hemispheres. Time zones. Seasons. Foucault pendulum. These aren't "lies eyes see" but consistent empirical observations. Wordplay's rhetorical power comes from memorable phrase structure, feeling of profound insight, and assumption that questioning mainstream narratives equals wisdom. Similar to "question everything" or "wake up" slogans - sounds enlightened but provides no specific evidence or logical argument. Image is propaganda piece using visual impact and wordplay rather than evidence-based reasoning.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-342","title":"Other 342","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802872_469146956618377_5555612780781728761_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-341","title":"Other 341","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802824_473127696220303_3868938798963817652_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-343","title":"Other 343","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802953_471673723032367_4433121116093448291_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
