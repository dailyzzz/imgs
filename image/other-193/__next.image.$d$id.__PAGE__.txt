3:T4a3,Brian Cox tweet defending moon landing overlaid on Apollo photograph. Background shows famous moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit planting American flag on lunar surface, gray rocky moon terrain, black space sky. Foreground shows Twitter interface screenshot of verified tweet from Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox), British physicist and TV presenter. Profile picture shows Cox's face. Blue verified checkmark next to name. Gear icon and 'Follow' button visible. Tweet text reads: 'I've said it before and I'll say it again - if you don't think Apollo 11 landed on Moon you are a colossal nob end & should get a new brain'. Bottom shows engagement metrics: '18,106 RETWEETS' and '5,483 FAVORITES' (old Twitter interface). Row of small profile pictures showing people who engaged with tweet. Cox's aggressive dismissive tone ('colossal nob end' - British insult) represents mainstream scientific community's contempt for moon landing skeptics. Tweet suggests questioning official narrative warrants ridicule rather than rational debate. Flat Earth/moon landing skeptics use this as example of argument from authority and ad hominem attacks instead of evidence-based discussion4:T526,Historical azimuthal equidistant map with ornate decorative elements. Shows antique Dutch cartographic artifact titled 'AERDSCHE' (partially visible at top) meaning 'Earthly' in Dutch. Large circular map projection with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map shows Americas on left in pink/red, Europe top-center in gray, Asia right side in yellow-tan, Africa lower center, Australia bottom-right in green. Grid lines create latitude/longitude network. Outer ring decorated with gold/yellow ornamental border with black markings. Corners adorned with elaborate allegorical illustrations - cherubs, angels, mythological figures representing four winds or seasons in baroque style with flowing robes, clouds. Upper corners show figures in blue/gold/red classical dress. Lower corners feature figures in green/brown/red garments. Figures hold various objects (flags, instruments, scrolls). Map center shows compass rose with radiating lines. Geographic features labeled in Latin/Dutch. Bottom banner: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text. Historical azimuthal equidistant projections were standard for polar navigation before modern era. Flat Earth proponents cite these historical maps as evidence cartographers knew true Earth shape, though projection is geometrically valid for spherical Earth navigation5:T477,Office Space Bill Lumbergh meme about airplane curvature claims. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) from 1999 comedy Office Space. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, burgundy/red suspenders, yellow tie with leopard/animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug. Has characteristic condescending smirk/smile expression. Blurred beige office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, doors visible. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'UMMM...YEAH, IF YOU COULD STOP SAYING YOU'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE FROM AN AIRPLANE'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate-speak ('that would be great') to mock common globe Earth claim. Many people report seeing Earth's curvature from commercial flights at 35,000-40,000 feet. Flat Earth proponents argue curvature isn't visible at these altitudes and what people see is either fisheye lens distortion from airplane windows or psychological expectation. Claims actual visibility of curvature requires much higher altitude (60,000+ feet)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-193","title":"Other 193","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552561_457569974442742_6404651084500412606_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-192","title":"Other 192","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12549026_455543561312050_8252161165943916382_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-194","title":"Other 194","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552819_457260614473678_7507966457741343678_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
