5:T4a3,Brian Cox tweet defending moon landing overlaid on Apollo photograph. Background shows famous moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit planting American flag on lunar surface, gray rocky moon terrain, black space sky. Foreground shows Twitter interface screenshot of verified tweet from Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox), British physicist and TV presenter. Profile picture shows Cox's face. Blue verified checkmark next to name. Gear icon and 'Follow' button visible. Tweet text reads: 'I've said it before and I'll say it again - if you don't think Apollo 11 landed on Moon you are a colossal nob end & should get a new brain'. Bottom shows engagement metrics: '18,106 RETWEETS' and '5,483 FAVORITES' (old Twitter interface). Row of small profile pictures showing people who engaged with tweet. Cox's aggressive dismissive tone ('colossal nob end' - British insult) represents mainstream scientific community's contempt for moon landing skeptics. Tweet suggests questioning official narrative warrants ridicule rather than rational debate. Flat Earth/moon landing skeptics use this as example of argument from authority and ad hominem attacks instead of evidence-based discussion0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 193 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Brian Cox tweet defending moon landing overlaid on Apollo photograph.
