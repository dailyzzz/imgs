13:T55e,Apollo 11 astronauts press conference meme questioning their demeanor. Shows famous August 12, 1969 post-flight press conference with three Apollo 11 astronauts seated at table with microphones. Left to right: Buzz Aldrin in light blue shirt, Neil Armstrong in light blue shirt (center), Michael Collins in light gray shirt. All three men appear serious, somber, uncomfortable - staring downward or to side, not smiling. Dark suits visible. Microphones on table in front. Background shows brown-tan curtains or backdrop. Overall mood appears tense, unhappy, or pressured rather than celebratory. Top text in white bold letters: 'DO THESE LOOK LIKE GUYS WHO JUST SUCCESSFULLY TRAVELED TO THE MOON AND BACK?' Center text overlay: 'APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUTS' in white letters. Bottom text: 'OR GUYS WHO ARE BEING FORCED TO LIE AND SAY THEY DID?' Bottom watermark shows 'MOON HOAX' website attribution. Moon landing skeptics frequently cite this press conference as evidence of deception. Argue astronauts' body language and facial expressions show guilt, stress, or fear rather than pride and excitement. Contrast somber demeanor with expectation that moon landing heroes would appear jubilant. Suggests astronauts were coerced into maintaining false narrative. Alternative explanations include exhaustion from mission, overwhelming media pressure, or natural reserved personalities14:T4dc,Book cover for 'The Greatest Lie on Earth' by Edward Hendrie. Shows book cover design with ocean background photograph - dark blue-green water surface with ripples and waves extending to horizon. Sky shows lighter blue gradient. Center displays vintage-style flat Earth azimuthal equidistant map showing continents arranged in circle with North Pole at center. Map shows colored landmasses: Americas in orange/red on left, Europe/Africa in green/yellow top-center, Asia in yellow right side, Australia bottom-right. White Antarctic ring circles outer perimeter. Map appears aged with cream/beige coloring and concentric circles indicating latitude lines. Curved text at top of map reads 'The Greatest Lie on Earth' in white serif font. Curved text below map reads 'Proof That Our World Is Not a Moving Globe' in similar style. Bottom of cover shows author name 'Edward Hendrie' in large white serif letters. Cover design uses authoritative book aesthetic with vintage cartography imagery suggesting historical evidence. Edward Hendrie is author of multiple books promoting flat Earth biblical cosmology and various conspiracy theories. Title claims globe Earth model is deliberate deception or 'greatest lie' rather than honest scientific error15:T6af,Nikola Tesla vs Albert Einstein comparison on relativity theory. Shows dark blue textured background with side-by-side vintage photographs of two famous physicists. Left side shows Nikola Tesla - dark slicked-back hair, thin mustache, wearing dark suit jacket with white collar, gazing to right with serious expression. Right side shows Albert Einstein - wild curly dark hair, thick mustache, wearing dark suit jacket, looking forward. Top displays golden-yellow text: 'Tesla on Einstein'. Main text in white and gold explains: 'When asked for his opinion on the theories of contemporary Albert Einstein, Tesla gave a scathing analysis of Relativity theory, calling it a' followed by gold italic text quote: 'magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king' with attribution '(Time, 1935).' Below continues: 'Tesla's own theorem went unpublished, yet his inventions displayed a beautiful simplicity that reflected the natural order:' followed by gold italic quote: 'My explanations of natural phenomena are not so involved as his, They are simpler, and... will throw light on many puzzling phenomena of the cosmos' with attribution '(Time, 1931).' Bottom shows 'Flat Earth Matters' in gray text. Contrasts Tesla's empirical approach with Einstein's mathematical relativity. Flat Earth proponents cite Tesla's criticism to suggest Einstein's theories are ungrounded mathematical abstractions divorced from physical reality. Uses appeal to authority of Tesla as inventor who achieved tangible results versus Einstein as theoretical physicist working in abstract mathematics9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-216","title":"Other 216","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12644939_460774740788932_4745799147834036286_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-215","title":"Other 215","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12644705_461801570686249_9202257357073544057_n.png","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-217","title":"Other 217","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12645225_457886284411111_918310355111631575_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
