Top-right panel shows two scuba divers underwater in blue water with sunlight filtering from above, captioned 'We've only explored 5% of Earth's oceans'. Bottom panel shows Voyager space probe with large dish antenna and gold record against starry background, with Captain Picard from Star Trek face-palming in corner, captioned 'Yet... NASA claims we have Voyager 1 and 2 Space Probes billions of miles away'. Suggests contradiction: if humanity has barely explored Earth's depths and oceans, claims of spacecraft billions of miles away seem implausible.

Top text: 'If the sun is 93 million miles away'. Four photographs show sun at different times with varying cloud positions relative to solar disc: top-left shows sun partially obscured by dark clouds creating layered effect, top-right shows sun behind lighter clouds, bottom-left shows sun low on horizon with dark foreground clouds, bottom-right shows sun with dramatic orange-red sunset clouds. Bottom question: 'How are the clouds behind it?' Watermark: 'Nick Tracki'. Argues that if sun were 93 million miles away, all clouds in Earth's atmosphere should appear in front of sun, while these images allegedly show clouds behind sun, suggesting much closer local sun consistent with flat Earth model. Mainstream explanation: optical illusion from cloud shadows and perspective making dark cloud portions appear behind bright sun"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-11","title":"Other 11","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/social-11.jpeg","description":"Artistic composite image with space theme suggesting NASA deception. Shows mirror-image pair of astronauts in white spacesuits with reflective helmet visors positioned symmetrically against Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Africa, Europe, and Middle East with clouds and oceans. Background features colorful nebula with blue and orange cosmic clouds. Astronauts hold arms forward creating illusion they're reaching toward or framing Earth. Bottom text in white letters: 'NASA in HEBREW means TO DECEIVE'. Claims Hebrew etymology of NASA acronym implies deceptive intent, though actual claim is disputed linguistic interpretation. Visual suggests astronauts and space photography are part of elaborate hoax.
