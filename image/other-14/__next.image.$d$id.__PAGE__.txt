Top photo shows large multi-story rectangular building (possibly Beau Rivage or similar Gulf Coast resort) with uniform grid of windows extending horizontally across frame, appearing perfectly vertical with no lean or tilt, photographed from water with slight atmospheric haze creating layered appearance. Large yellow text overlaid: 'No tilt means NO CURVE'. Bottom section shows technical diagram with white background illustrating sight line geometry from observer position (h0) to building labeled as 'Target' across distance (d1) with green arc representing Earth curvature and 'Horizon' marked.

Argues that if Earth were curved, distant buildings photographed across water should appear tilted away from observer due to surface curvature, while straight vertical appearance allegedly proves flat plane"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-13","title":"Other 13","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/social-13.jpeg","description":"Three-panel flat horizon observation meme. Large left panel shows famous Christ the Redeemer statue (Cristo Redentor) in Rio de Janeiro with arms outstretched, overlooking city, mountains, and coastline with ocean and islands visible, sky with clouds. Orange construction level tool digitally placed across Christ's outstretched arms showing bubble centered, suggesting flat horizon. Bottom blue text: 'NO CURVE HERE'. Top-right panel shows Earth from International Space Station perspective with curved horizon visible against black space, captioned 'STRAIGHT OUTTA PHOTOSHOP' referencing Straight Outta Compton meme format, implying space photos are manipulated. Bottom-right shows child in blue jacket and cap looking through black binoculars. Argues visible flat horizon from high vantage points contradicts curved Earth shown in space photography, suggesting space images are fabricated while ground-level observations show truth"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-15","title":"Other 15","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/pattern-1.jpeg","description":"Four-panel Men in Black movie meme featuring Will Smith in orange shirt and Tommy Lee Jones in black suit outdoors with city buildings in background. Panel 1: Agent K states 'A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals and you know it.' Panel 2: 'Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe.' Panel 3: 'Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.' Panel 4: Close-up of Agent J (Will Smith) looking contemplative with yellow text 'Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.' Suggests scientific consensus changes over time, implying current beliefs may be wrong, commonly used to support flat Earth theory by arguing mainstream science has been wrong before"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
