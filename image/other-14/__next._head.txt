Top photo shows large multi-story rectangular building (possibly Beau Rivage or similar Gulf Coast resort) with uniform grid of windows extending horizontally across frame, appearing perfectly vertical with no lean or tilt, photographed from water with slight atmospheric haze creating layered appearance.

Bottom section shows technical diagram with white background illustrating sight line geometry from observer position (h0) to building labeled as 'Target' across distance (d1) with green arc representing Earth curvature and 'Horizon' marked.
