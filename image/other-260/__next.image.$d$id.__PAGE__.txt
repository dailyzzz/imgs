3:T8a4,Water sticking to ball Earth meme using tilted tray demonstration. Flat Earth argument questioning how water adheres to spinning spherical Earth using practical demonstration. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER CURVES AND STICKS TO BALL EARTH?'. Central image shows experimental setup with clear plastic laboratory tray or sample holder containing multiple compartments filled with colored liquids. Tray appears to be standard scientific sample holder with approximately 8-10 rectangular wells/compartments. Each compartment contains liquid in different color: yellow, light green, mint green, light blue, purple, dark purple gradient left to right. Tray mounted at steep downward angle (approximately 30-40 degrees) on brown wooden support stand or holder. Despite significant tilt, colored liquids remain level within their compartments, demonstrating water's tendency to find level surface. Liquid surfaces appear horizontal, perpendicular to gravity, not parallel to tilted tray bottom. Background shows white or light gray wall with visible texture/wear. Stand supported by metal or dark supports on sides. Wooden horizontal bar connects supports. Social media attribution in lower left: '@nasa_is_lying_to_us' in black text. Bottom text in massive bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTIFIC MYTH'. Light gray/off-white textured background. Argument structure: If Earth is spinning ball, water should fly off due to centrifugal force, or if gravity strong enough to hold oceans, water should curve around ball. This demonstration attempts to show water always seeks level, cannot stick to or curve around exterior of sphere. However, argument ignores scale differences. Earth is 12,742 km diameter - from human perspective on surface, curvature is imperceptible. Gravity acts toward center (down), not 'sideways' as implied. Small tray tilted has visible angle; on massive sphere, local 'down' is always perpendicular to surface at that location. Water does curve around Earth - ships disappear bottom-first over horizon, cannot see across large bodies of water. Demonstration conflates local level (perpendicular to gravity) with global level (curved surface of sphere)4:T80a,Flat Earth cosmology diagram showing 24-hour sun cycle with Fibonacci and prime number symbolism. Artistic educational diagram titled at top: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE' on beige/tan border. Central image shows dome Earth model with firmament enclosed circular plane. Earth disc displays continents in green against blue oceans, surrounded by dark blue/black dome or barrier. Ice ring/Antarctica forms outer edge. Above Earth floats sun symbol - yellow/cream circle with radiating triangular rays representing light. Small circle below sun indicates moon or another celestial body. Around central Earth arranged circular pattern of numbers 1-24 representing 24-hour clock/day cycle. Numbers positioned in clockwise arrangement: top has 13, 14, 15 (daylight hours), continuing around through 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 (nighttime hours) on dark blue section, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 completing circle. Dashed curved line segments between numbers suggest sun's circular path around Earth center. Numbers have dual significance indicated by legend at bottom: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS' (left side, white dot) and 'PRIME NUMBERS' (right side, white dot with circle). Some numbers marked with circled symbols indicating both properties. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...) where each number is sum of previous two, appears in nature (spirals, growth patterns). Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom subtitle: 'THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN'. Aesthetic combines vintage scientific illustration style with modern flat Earth cosmology. Suggests mathematical/mystical significance to 24-hour solar cycle in flat Earth model. Sun circles above stationary plane creating day/night cycle through proximity. Dark blue section represents night side where sun is distant. Diagram implies intelligent design through mathematical patterns embedded in timekeeping and celestial mechanics. Beige border and serif font give antique authority appearance, mimicking historical astronomical charts5:T5ea,Aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting ocean water. Shows striking natural boundary between ice and sea in polar region. Left side of image displays dark navy-blue ocean water with slightly rippled surface showing wave texture and occasional white specks suggesting floating ice fragments, sea foam, or atmospheric particles. Water appears deep and cold. Center features dramatic irregular ice edge - thick white and light blue glacial ice forming natural cliff or wall where ice shelf meets ocean. Edge shows jagged, uneven formation with vertical face where ice has broken or calved. Ice surface appears textured with rough, crystalline structure. Transition zone between ice and water shows light blue-white coloring where ice meets sea. Right side shows ice shelf surface extending into distance - bright white snow and ice covering with pale gray-blue sky above. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations. Sky shows overcast or hazy conditions typical of polar environments. Photograph likely taken from aircraft or drone looking down at approximately 30-45 degree angle. Image captures stark beauty of Antarctic landscape and ongoing process of ice shelf dynamics where glacial ice continuously breaks off into ocean. No text visible. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter, though this shows typical ice shelf calving process occurring throughout Antarctic coastline. Image demonstrates natural glacial processes at edge of continent0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-260","title":"Other 260","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705795_464572817075791_8269778798616448831_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-259","title":"THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705737_464902197042853_6204340604245065291_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-261","title":"Other 261","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12710947_461770347356038_3681852479021078351_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
