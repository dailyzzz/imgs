5:T8a4,Water sticking to ball Earth meme using tilted tray demonstration. Flat Earth argument questioning how water adheres to spinning spherical Earth using practical demonstration. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER CURVES AND STICKS TO BALL EARTH?'. Central image shows experimental setup with clear plastic laboratory tray or sample holder containing multiple compartments filled with colored liquids. Tray appears to be standard scientific sample holder with approximately 8-10 rectangular wells/compartments. Each compartment contains liquid in different color: yellow, light green, mint green, light blue, purple, dark purple gradient left to right. Tray mounted at steep downward angle (approximately 30-40 degrees) on brown wooden support stand or holder. Despite significant tilt, colored liquids remain level within their compartments, demonstrating water's tendency to find level surface. Liquid surfaces appear horizontal, perpendicular to gravity, not parallel to tilted tray bottom. Background shows white or light gray wall with visible texture/wear. Stand supported by metal or dark supports on sides. Wooden horizontal bar connects supports. Social media attribution in lower left: '@nasa_is_lying_to_us' in black text. Bottom text in massive bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTIFIC MYTH'. Light gray/off-white textured background. Argument structure: If Earth is spinning ball, water should fly off due to centrifugal force, or if gravity strong enough to hold oceans, water should curve around ball. This demonstration attempts to show water always seeks level, cannot stick to or curve around exterior of sphere. However, argument ignores scale differences. Earth is 12,742 km diameter - from human perspective on surface, curvature is imperceptible. Gravity acts toward center (down), not 'sideways' as implied. Small tray tilted has visible angle; on massive sphere, local 'down' is always perpendicular to surface at that location. Water does curve around Earth - ships disappear bottom-first over horizon, cannot see across large bodies of water. Demonstration conflates local level (perpendicular to gravity) with global level (curved surface of sphere)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 260 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Water sticking to ball Earth meme using tilted tray demonstration.
