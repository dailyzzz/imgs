Left side features portrait of Isaac Newton with formula F = Gm₁m₂/r² and text in green 'It's a force. It depends on mass.' Right side shows portrait of Albert Einstein with formula Gμν = 8πGTμν and text in yellow 'It's a distortion of space & time. It depends on energy.' Three red dots connect the competing theories vertically. Bottom text on dark blue background explains: 'As we have seen, matter does not simply pull on other matter across empty space, as Newton had imagined. Rather matter distorts space-time and it is this distorted space-time that in turn affects other matter.' Presents fundamental conceptual difference between Newtonian gravity as force between masses versus Einsteinian gravity as geometric curvature of spacetime caused by energy-mass."},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-22","title":"Gravity 22","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/54256835_10156104503436770_963260275711016960_n.jpeg","description":"Humorous illustration titled 'GRAVITY' showing six bottles of hot sauce with labels reading 'Gravity HOT SAUCE' in various red and white bottle designs, with text below reading 'The magic sauce you can put on any heliocentric problem' and black banner at bottom stating 'Available at all fine indoctrination camps'"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-24","title":"Gravity 24","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/77018941_159247721989321_2753224695598809088_o.jpeg","description":"Meme featuring physics professor or researcher standing in front of green chalkboard covered with complex mathematical equations and formulas related to density and buoyancy (hashtag #DensityAndBuoyancy visible in top right).
