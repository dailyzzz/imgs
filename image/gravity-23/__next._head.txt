Right side shows portrait of Albert Einstein with formula Gμν = 8πGTμν and text in yellow 'It's a distortion of space & time. It depends on energy.' Three red dots connect the competing theories vertically. Bottom text on dark blue background explains: 'As we have seen, matter does not simply pull on other matter across empty space, as Newton had imagined. Rather matter distorts space-time and it is this distorted space-time that in turn affects other matter.' Presents fundamental conceptual difference between Newtonian gravity as force between masses versus Einsteinian gravity as geometric curvature of spacetime caused by energy-mass."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Gravity 23"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Educational comparison titled 'What is Gravity?' showing Newton versus Einstein's theories.
