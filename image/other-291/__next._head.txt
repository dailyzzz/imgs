5:T7ac,Flat Earth map showing analemma sun path and flight routes diagram. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with flight paths and solar patterns labeled as analemma. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central circular map on black background shows continents in bright green. North Pole at center with landmasses radiating outward: North America on right side, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia across top and upper left, Australia lower left. Black ocean areas surround green continents. Outer edge shows thick light blue/white ring representing ice wall or Antarctic barrier. Multiple concentric circular lines in different colors overlay map representing climate zones, tropics, or sun paths: Outermost white/light blue ring (Antarctic Circle), red circle (Tropic of Capricorn area), yellow/orange circle (Tropic of Cancer area), smaller circles toward center. Several curved dotted lines trace across map appearing to show flight paths or sun's analemma pattern - lines curve in arcs connecting different locations. White dashed line curves from near Africa across Pacific toward South America. Red dashed line arcs from Asia area. Yellow/orange curved line near center. Labels partially visible reading 'IS CANCERI...' (likely Tropic of Cancer), 'ANTARCTIC...' (Antarctic Circle), other geographic markers. Bottom text on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Analemma typically refers to figure-8 pattern sun traces in sky over year when photographed from same location at same time daily - results from Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit. This diagram attempts to show analemma on flat Earth map, but unclear how flat Earth model would produce this pattern. Lines might also represent claimed airline flight paths that allegedly make more sense on flat map than globe (though this is projection distortion illusion - routes are actually great circles on sphere). Map uses vintage aesthetic with beige border0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 291 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth map showing analemma sun path and flight routes diagram.
