3:T7ac,Flat Earth map showing analemma sun path and flight routes diagram. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with flight paths and solar patterns labeled as analemma. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central circular map on black background shows continents in bright green. North Pole at center with landmasses radiating outward: North America on right side, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia across top and upper left, Australia lower left. Black ocean areas surround green continents. Outer edge shows thick light blue/white ring representing ice wall or Antarctic barrier. Multiple concentric circular lines in different colors overlay map representing climate zones, tropics, or sun paths: Outermost white/light blue ring (Antarctic Circle), red circle (Tropic of Capricorn area), yellow/orange circle (Tropic of Cancer area), smaller circles toward center. Several curved dotted lines trace across map appearing to show flight paths or sun's analemma pattern - lines curve in arcs connecting different locations. White dashed line curves from near Africa across Pacific toward South America. Red dashed line arcs from Asia area. Yellow/orange curved line near center. Labels partially visible reading 'IS CANCERI...' (likely Tropic of Cancer), 'ANTARCTIC...' (Antarctic Circle), other geographic markers. Bottom text on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Analemma typically refers to figure-8 pattern sun traces in sky over year when photographed from same location at same time daily - results from Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit. This diagram attempts to show analemma on flat Earth map, but unclear how flat Earth model would produce this pattern. Lines might also represent claimed airline flight paths that allegedly make more sense on flat map than globe (though this is projection distortion illusion - routes are actually great circles on sphere). Map uses vintage aesthetic with beige border4:T7d1,Pop art comic style meme about silence proving Earth not spinning. Retro comic book panel format mocking expectation of hearing Earth's rotation. Top text in large bold white letters: 'SHH.... DO YOU HEAR THAT?' Image shows classic pop art illustration in Roy Lichtenstein style. Man on left with black hair in blue shirt/collar leans toward woman on right whispering with hand cupped near mouth in secretive gesture. Man has dramatic expression with one eye closed, thin mustache, angular features typical of comic art. Woman on right has blonde short hair, defined features, bright blue eyes with long lashes, red lipstick, purple/lavender clothing or earring visible. Both drawn in bold black outlines with Ben-Day dots halftone pattern. Background bright yellow with black polka dot screen print texture characteristic of 1960s comic books and pop art. Lower right shows 'JM' artist signature. Small rectangular overlay shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom text in bold white letters with black outline: 'THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE EARTH NOT SPINNING'. Meme suggests we should hear Earth's rotation if planet were spinning - since we hear silence, Earth must be stationary. Classic flat Earth argument about lacking perception of motion. However, argument ignores physics of reference frames and inertial motion. We don't 'hear' Earth's rotation because: 1) Atmosphere rotates with surface (no wind rushing past), 2) We're in same reference frame as everything around us (constant velocity produces no sensation), 3) Sound requires medium vibration - smooth rotation doesn't create sound. Similar to how airplane passengers don't 'hear' plane moving at 500 mph through cabin - only turbulence or acceleration creates sensation. Earth's rotation is smooth, constant. We DO feel it indirectly through: Coriolis effect on weather patterns, Foucault pendulum rotation, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, day/night cycle. Silence proves smooth motion, not stationary position5:T8b1,Water level collage demonstrating flat horizon argument across multiple scenarios. Six-panel photographic collage showing water surfaces appearing level/flat. Top left: Tropical beach with turquoise Caribbean-blue shallow water, white sandy bottom visible through clear water, horizon line appears perfectly straight across distance where water meets sky. Light blue sky with slight clouds. Top center: Straight country road stretching into distance with green fields on sides, gray asphalt, blue sky with white clouds, power lines visible. Rural landscape. Top right: Canal or waterway with dark still water reflecting sky, straight towpath along right side, brick building visible on right, trees and vegetation, overcast sky. Surface appears perfectly flat and mirror-like. Center: Diagram showing water level demonstration with connected vessels - scientific illustration with four glass tubes/cylinders of different heights connected at bottom by clear tube creating U-shape or connected vessel system. Blue water fills tubes to same level across all containers (labeled with measurements: 1 ft, 2 ft, 3 ft, 4 ft markers) demonstrating principle that water finds same level in connected containers regardless of vessel height. Water colored blue for visibility. Bottom left: Aerial/satellite view of coastline showing tan/beige land meeting bright turquoise shallow water, deeper blue-black ocean beyond, white sandy beach or sediment visible. Shows large scale where water surface appears flat. Bottom right: Aerial view of meandering river or waterway creating S-curves through dark landscape, water appears silver-gray reflecting sky, shows natural water flow patterns. Red horizontal line drawn across top of image spanning entire width suggesting level measurement or horizon reference. Collage argues water always finds level, never curves - therefore large bodies of water prove flat Earth. Classic flat Earth claim. However, 'level' means perpendicular to gravity direction, which points toward Earth's center. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface - creates curved surface globally while appearing flat locally. Water DOES curve with Earth - ships disappear hull-first over horizon0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-291","title":"Other 291","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742400_464902280376178_8340434939850423488_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-290","title":"Other 290","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742357_466263566906716_2768320922267363826_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-292","title":"Other 292","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742578_464246053775134_5958850086261502289_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
