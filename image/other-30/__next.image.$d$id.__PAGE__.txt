Top panel shows classical religious artwork of Jesus Christ in white and red robes standing on rocky outcrop overlooking water, with figure kneeling before him gesturing at horizon asking 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T SEE THE CURVATURE???' Jesus responds 'DUDE...' Bottom text quotes 'Matthew 4:8 \"The Deceiver took him to a very high mountain, and showed him ALL!! the kingdoms of the world in their 'glory.'\" Bottom panel shows two diagrams with space background: Left shows flat Earth model under dome with figure standing on it, green checkmark indicates 'ALL KINGDOMS' visible from height. Right shows globe Earth with figure, red X indicates impossible to see all kingdoms from any single point. Text: '§AR 27 #TrustFlatWater'.

Word 'ball' highlighted in yellow. Below repeated 'Isaiah 22:18'.

Majestic jagged mountain with glaciers and snow visible against blue sky with white clouds. Foreground shows autumn colors - orange and red vegetation mixed with green coniferous trees (likely Douglas fir or similar species). Crystal-clear lake creates mirror-perfect reflection of entire scene, doubling visual impact. Natural beauty showcasing pristine wilderness, possibly Pacific Northwest or Canadian Rockies region. Could be used in flat Earth context as example of observing distant mountains across water without apparent curvature obstruction"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
