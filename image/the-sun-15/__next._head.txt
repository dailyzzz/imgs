White text at top reads 'THE SUN IS JUST ABOVE THESE CLOUDS IF IT WAS 93 MILLION MILES AWAY' and bottom text states 'THE RAYS WOULD BE COMING THROUGH THE OPEN SPACES TO THE LEFT...END OF STORY!' Argues that visible convergence of sun rays (crepuscular rays) from right side of clouds proves sun is close and local rather than 93 million miles away. Suggests if sun were distant, light rays should appear parallel and illuminate cloud gaps on left side equally. Uses atmospheric optical effect of crepuscular rays converging toward light source as evidence against astronomical distance measurements. Actually demonstrates perspective: parallel light rays from distant sun appear to converge due to perspective, similar to railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Sun 15"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Meme showing dramatic ocean sunset scene with sun rays (crepuscular rays) breaking through thick storm clouds over water.
