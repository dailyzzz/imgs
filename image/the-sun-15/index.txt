Bottom panel shows upward view through tree canopy with bright sun shining through leaves and branches creating dramatic lens flare and light rays. Uses Jim Carrey quote to promote geocentric model where sun orbits Earth rather than heliocentric model where Earth orbits sun. Quote format suggests tweet or social media post. Image presents geocentrism as reassuring or common-sense position, with bright sun photograph through trees providing visual emphasis. Note: No verified record of Jim Carrey making this specific statement exists"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-16","title":"The Sun 16","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/246173748_1042830916559354_1101154082989590533_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme demonstrating local sun model creating day/night cycle. Top panel shows nighttime residential street scene with streetlight illuminating road with warm orange glow, labeled 'DAY' under lit area and 'NIGHT' in dark areas beyond light's reach. Bottom panel shows similar street scene with streetlight creating circular pool of yellow light on pavement, again labeled 'DAY' in illuminated area and 'NIGHT' in surrounding darkness. Large white text reads 'HOW A SMALL LOCAL SUN CAN CREATE DAY AND NIGHT' with '@flatworldlogic' watermark. Uses streetlight analogy to explain flat Earth day/night cycle: small, close sun acts like spotlight moving over flat Earth plane, illuminating local area (creating day) while areas outside light cone remain dark (night). Presents alternative to Earth's rotation explanation, arguing local sun with limited illumination radius can create observable day/night pattern on stationary flat surface"}}]
