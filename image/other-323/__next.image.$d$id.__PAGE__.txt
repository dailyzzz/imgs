3:Tbbf,Lake Powell red rock canyon perfect water reflection arguing water proves flat Earth. Stunning landscape photograph showing dramatic desert canyon scenery with mirror-like water reflection. Upper half displays towering red-orange sandstone rock formations - massive cliff faces and buttes characteristic of American Southwest (appears to be Lake Powell area, Arizona/Utah). Central formation shows prominent pyramidal peak with layered sedimentary rock strata visible in horizontal bands. Rocks display warm earth tones: deep red-orange, rust, burnt sienna in upper exposed portions transitioning to lighter tan, cream, white in lower sections showing different mineral compositions and weathering patterns. Vertical striations and erosion patterns create textured surfaces. Formations show millions of years of geological layering. Clear blue sky with scattered white clouds above - mix of puffy cumulus clouds creating pleasant partly-cloudy conditions. Upper left shows 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in semi-transparent beige text. Lower half displays perfectly calm water surface acting as flawless mirror. Water reflects entire canyon scene with nearly perfect symmetry - rock formations, clouds, sky all duplicated upside-down in water. Reflection so clear that dividing line between reality and reflection almost invisible. Water appears absolutely still without ripples - glass-like surface creates pristine mirror effect. Rocks, clouds, even fine details perfectly replicated in reflection. Water shows deep blue color matching sky with brown tones near rock reflections. Scene demonstrates how calm water creates perfect reflections on locally flat surface. Bottom text on dark translucent overlay in large white sans-serif letters: 'The Natural Physics of Water Prove Earth Flat'. Classic flat Earth argument claiming water's tendency to find level surface and create mirror-like reflections proves Earth cannot be curved sphere. Argues that water always seeks level (horizontal) surface, cannot curve around ball. However, this photograph actually demonstrates local flatness on globally curved surface. Lake Powell reservoir has water surface area of ~250 square miles. At this scale, Earth's curvature is only ~130 feet across entire lake (calculated using radius 3,959 miles). This subtle curve completely imperceptible in photo. Water DOES curve following Earth's sphere - 'level' means perpendicular to gravity at each point, which creates curved surface globally while appearing flat locally. Perfect reflections occur because light reflects at consistent angles on calm water regardless of whether surface is part of sphere. Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across very large bodies of water, different water 'levels' (actually tangent points to sphere) at different locations all prove water does curve with Earth. Photograph shows local level, not global level. Similar to how small square cut from basketball appears flat despite basketball being spherical4:Tc27,Ocean sunset photograph arguing against spherical Earth based on personal observation. Beautiful seascape photograph during golden hour with flat Earth claims overlaid. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'I SEE NO CURVATURE, I FEEL NO SPINNING EARTH BENEATH MY FEET'. Upper portion shows dramatic sunset sky - layers of clouds in shades of deep orange, burnt sienna, golden yellow, and dark gray-brown. Sun appears as bright yellow-white disc sitting on horizon surrounded by brilliant orange glow. Clouds create horizontal striations across sky with darker cloud bottoms contrasting against illuminated edges. Sky shows gradient from warmer tones near horizon to cooler blues above (though mostly cropped). Light breaks through cloud gaps creating atmospheric rays (crepuscular rays). Middle section displays ocean surface - calm water reflects sunset colors creating mirror effect. Golden-orange reflection of sun creates vertical column of light on water surface. Water appears mostly dark brown-orange in foreground transitioning to brighter orange-gold near horizon where sun's reflection is most intense. Small ripples and waves visible on surface but overall appears relatively calm. Horizon line perfectly straight extending horizontally across frame dividing sky from ocean. No visible land masses or objects - just open ocean. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'I FEEL THE WARMTH OF THE SUN CLOSE , NOT 93 MILLION MILES AWAY'. Lower portion shows 'Flat Earth Matters' branding. Image represents common flat Earth argument based on personal sensory experience: 1) Can't see curvature from ground level therefore Earth is flat, 2) Don't feel Earth spinning at 1,000 mph therefore it's stationary, 3) Sun feels warm therefore must be close, not 93 million miles away. However, these observations actually consistent with spherical Earth: 1) Curvature imperceptible at sea level due to planet's massive size - only becomes visible from high altitude (50,000+ feet shows obvious curve), 2) Don't feel rotation because atmosphere rotates with Earth, everything moves together (inertial reference frame), similar to not feeling airplane's 500 mph speed, 3) Sun's warmth results from electromagnetic radiation traveling through vacuum - distance doesn't prevent heat transfer via radiation. At 93 million miles, sun still delivers ~1,361 watts per square meter to Earth's surface. Inverse square law explains how star that massive and hot can warm Earth from that distance. Photograph itself ironically shows evidence of spherical Earth - sunset occurs because Earth's rotation carries observer away from sun. On flat Earth with local sun circling above, sun would shrink into distance rather than setting below horizon. Ships disappearing hull-first over ocean horizon proves water surface curves. Human perception evolved for human-scale environments, not intuiting planetary physics or astronomical distances. Science extends beyond direct sensory experience through measurement, mathematics, and instruments5:Tb52,Child blocking ears meme with Professor Brian Cox social media post about blocking conspiracy theorists. Internet meme showing frustrated child combined with screenshot mocking physicist Brian Cox's response to conspiracy theorists. Top text in large bold white outlined letters on light background: 'WHEN YOU CAN'T DEBATE THE GLOBE SO ALL YOU HAVE ARE INSULTS'. Main image shows young boy (approximately 7-10 years old) making exaggerated frustrated expression with eyes squeezed tightly shut, mouth open showing teeth in grimace of annoyance. Both hands raised with index fingers plugged into ears in classic 'I can't hear you' gesture - childish way of blocking out unwanted information. Child wears black t-shirt. White background suggests studio photograph or isolated image. Expression and pose convey refusal to listen, shutting out opposing viewpoints, immature response to disagreement. Lower portion shows Facebook post screenshot. Profile picture shows person wearing winter hat/beanie. Name reads 'Professor Brian Cox' with timestamp '9 hrs' and globe icon indicating public post. Post text reads: 'Amusing myself by blocking everyone who thinks either moon landings fake or Earth flat #futilegesturesthatneverthelessmakeushappy'. Hashtag references futile but satisfying actions. Right side shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution in black box. Meme criticizes Professor Brian Cox (British physicist, TV presenter, professor at University of Manchester, known for science communication programs like 'The Universe' and 'Human Universe') for blocking flat Earth believers and moon landing deniers rather than engaging in debate. Positions his blocking as childish refusal to discuss evidence, equivalent to child plugging ears. Implies Cox can't defend globe Earth through reasoned argument so resorts to blocking/insults. However, Cox likely blocked users not due to inability to debate, but because: 1) Professional scientists receive overwhelming volume of conspiracy theory comments making meaningful discussion impossible, 2) Most social media flat Earth debates involve bad-faith arguments, moving goalposts, rejection of evidence, 3) Cox has addressed these topics extensively in his programs and books with evidence, 4) Sometimes blocking is appropriate boundary-setting rather than admission of defeat. Cox is accomplished physicist who regularly explains evidence for spherical Earth, space exploration, physics of planetary formation. His decision to block persistent conspiracy theorists represents time management rather than inability to debate. Meme tries to position blocking as weakness when it may be reasonable response to unproductive repeated arguments. However, format resonates because condescending dismissal without engagement can feel unsatisfying to those genuinely questioning. Balance needed between patient education and boundary-setting with bad-faith actors0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-323","title":"Other 323","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792163_468785296654543_7026265244968193424_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-322","title":"Other 322","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792123_472436566289416_7654048677470120033_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-324","title":"Other 324","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792190_471789219687484_3939437447536827211_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
