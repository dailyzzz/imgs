3:T1f31,Burning globe Earth image with text claiming exposing "globe Earth lie" causes modern science, gravity, Big Bang, and evolution to "fall apart." Dramatic apocalyptic imagery showing Earth as flaming sphere being destroyed, representing flat Earth belief that spherical Earth is foundational lie upon which all modern science is built. Image suggests rejecting globe Earth leads to spiritual awakening and self-discovery. VISUAL COMPOSITION: Background shows serene natural landscape - calm water (lake or sea) reflecting sky, mountains or hills in distance, golden/amber atmospheric lighting suggesting sunrise or sunset. Peaceful natural scene contrasts dramatically with central destruction imagery. CENTRAL IMAGE: Globe Earth depicted as sphere engulfed in flames and fire. Planet appears to be burning, disintegrating, or exploding. Fire effects show orange, yellow, red flames consuming the sphere. Globe shows recognizable continental shapes (Africa visible) being destroyed by flames. Artistic rendering combining photograph of landscape with digitally composited burning globe. Symbolism clear: the "lie" of globe Earth being destroyed/exposed, burning away deception to reveal truth. Water reflection shows burning globe mirrored below, creating symmetrical composition. TEXT CONTENT - Multiple layers of text overlaid on image: TOP TEXT (yellow, large font): "WHEN WE EXPOSE THE GLOBE EARTH LIE" - Opening statement framing spherical Earth as deliberate deception to be revealed/exposed. MIDDLE TEXT (yellow, smaller font, sequential statements): "MODERN SCIENCE FALLS APART" - Claim that globe Earth is foundation of modern science, removing it collapses everything. "WHICH CAUSES THE THEORY OF GRAVITY TO FALL APART" - Gravity specifically targeted as dependent on globe Earth model. "WHICH CAUSES THE BIG BANG THEORY TO FALL APART" - Cosmological origins theory linked to globe Earth. "WHICH CAUSES EVOLUTION TO FALL APART" - Evolutionary biology connected to globe model. "AND WHEN WE FINALLY REALIZE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT EVERYTHING" - Culminating claim of total systematic deception. BOTTOM TEXT (yellow, large font): "WE CAN THEN BEGIN TO DISCOVER WHO WE TRULY ARE AND WHY WE ARE HERE" - Spiritual/existential conclusion suggesting flat Earth truth leads to self-discovery and purpose. ATTRIBUTION: "Nick Havok" credited in bottom right corner - likely image creator. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT STRUCTURE: Image presents domino theory of scientific deception: 1) Globe Earth is the foundational lie. 2) Gravity was invented to explain how things stay on spinning ball (flat Earth claims gravity is fake, density/buoyancy explains falling objects). 3) Big Bang requires universe of spherical planets/stars (flat Earth model has different cosmology - dome/firmament over flat plane). 4) Evolution requires billions of years and cosmic scale that globe Earth/Big Bang provides (flat Earth often tied to young Earth creationism). 5) All modern science built on these interconnected "lies." 6) Exposing globe Earth topples entire edifice of scientific knowledge. 7) Once "truth" revealed, spiritual awakening follows - discovering true nature of reality, humanity's purpose, perhaps religious truth previously hidden by scientific materialism. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE: Globe Earth, gravity, Big Bang, evolution are separate theories with independent evidence. Disproving one wouldn't automatically disprove others. Each supported by different types of evidence from different fields. 2) GRAVITY: Gravity is directly observable (objects fall, tides occur, planets orbit). Mathematical predictions of gravitational theory verified to extreme precision. GPS satellites, space missions, planetary probes all operate using gravitational calculations that work perfectly. Gravity doesn't require belief in globe Earth - it's independently measurable. 3) BIG BANG: Supported by cosmic microwave background radiation, observed expansion of universe, abundance of light elements, galaxy formation observations. Evidence doesn't depend on Earth's shape - comes from telescopes and instruments measuring distant cosmos. 4) EVOLUTION: Supported by fossil record, genetic evidence, observed speciation, biogeography, comparative anatomy. Evidence comes from biology, genetics, paleontology - fields unrelated to Earth's shape. Evolution would be true whether Earth is sphere, flat, or cube. 5) GLOBE EARTH: Supported by circumnavigation, satellite imagery, physics of gravity, astronomical observations, ship disappearance over horizon, time zones, different star visibility at different latitudes, lunar eclipse shadow, and countless other independent observations. Not arbitrary choice but conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. CONSPIRACY THEORY STRUCTURE: Image exemplifies "grand unified conspiracy" thinking where multiple separate "lies" are connected into single massive deception: If globe Earth is lie, then NASA lies, then space exploration is fake, then satellites are fake, then physics is wrong, then Big Bang is fiction, then evolution is fiction, then all scientists are either deceived or complicit, then entire educational system spreads lies, then media reinforces lies, then governments worldwide cooperate in deception. This creates unfalsifiable worldview where any contradicting evidence is simply "part of the lie." Scale of conspiracy required is impossibly large - millions of scientists, educators, pilots, sailors, engineers would need to be deceived or actively lying. RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL DIMENSION: Final line about discovering "who we truly are and why we are here" reveals spiritual motivation underlying many flat Earth beliefs. Movement often connected to: Biblical literalism (interpreting verses about firmament, pillars of Earth, four corners literally). Rejection of scientific materialism as spiritually empty worldview. Belief that globe Earth/evolution/Big Bang specifically designed to undermine religious faith. Sense that scientific establishment is Satanic or anti-God conspiracy. Desire for humanity to have special cosmic significance (flat Earth with dome often places humanity at center of creation, unlike heliocentric model where Earth is one planet among billions). PSYCHOLOGICAL APPEAL: Image appeals to: Distrust of authority/institutions. Desire for hidden knowledge. Sense of being special/awakened while masses are deceived. Spiritual seeking and desire for meaning. Rejection of complexity in favor of simple explanations. Community belonging in alternative truth movement. Feeling empowered by "seeing through lies" that fooled everyone else. VISUAL RHETORIC: Burning globe is powerful symbolic image: Destruction of false beliefs (cathartic). Fire as purification (burning away deception). Dramatic apocalyptic imagery appealing to those expecting end times or great awakening. Juxtaposition with peaceful nature background suggests truth brings serenity while lies create chaos. Reflection in water creates dreamlike quality suggesting transition between states of consciousness. Golden lighting evokes spiritual/mystical atmosphere. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works as propaganda by: Presenting complex scientific topics as single interconnected conspiracy rather than separate fields. Using emotional imagery (burning, destruction) rather than logical argument. Promising spiritual reward (self-discovery, purpose) for accepting flat Earth truth. Creating us-vs-them dynamic (awakened few vs deceived masses). Providing simple explanation for complex world (it's all lies). Not requiring viewer to understand any actual science - just reject it wholesale. CRITIQUE: Image makes claims without evidence, assumes connections between unrelated fields, requires impossibly large conspiracy, contradicts directly observable reality, appeals to emotion rather than reason, and promises unfalsifiable spiritual rewards for belief. Represents conspiracy thinking pattern rather than scientific inquiry.4:T1f19,Sarcastic meme labeling cell phone tower as "REAL GPS SATELLITES" claiming GPS works via ground towers not orbiting satellites. Image presents flat Earth argument that Global Positioning System operates through terrestrial infrastructure rather than space-based satellites, implying satellites don't exist or space travel is fake. Photograph shows typical cellular communications tower against clear blue sky. Tower is tall metal lattice structure rising from ground (likely 50-100+ feet tall). Main vertical pole is gray/silver metal with triangular lattice framework providing structural support. Multiple horizontal platforms/arms extend from upper portion at different heights supporting antenna equipment. ANTENNA ARRAYS: Upper section shows multiple white rectangular panel antennas - sector antennas typical of cellular base stations. Antennas arranged pointing outward in different directions to provide 360-degree coverage area. Each rectangular panel is directional antenna serving specific sector of coverage circle. Multiple panels at different heights may serve different frequencies/technologies (2G, 3G, 4G LTE, 5G). EQUIPMENT: Various gray/white equipment boxes visible mounted on tower - likely contain radio transceivers, amplifiers, power equipment. Cables run down tower connecting antennas to equipment and ground-level facilities. Metal framework includes climbing pegs/ladder for technician access during maintenance. Tower design is standard telecommunications infrastructure visible in urban/suburban areas worldwide. SKY BACKGROUND: Clear blue sky with few wispy white clouds. Bright daylight illumination suggesting midday. Sky color gradients naturally from deeper blue at top to lighter near horizon. Pleasant weather conditions making tower clearly visible without obstruction. TEXT OVERLAYS: Upper left in white text: "fb.com/fematters" attribution identifying flat Earth community source. Bottom of image in large bold white letters with black outline: "REAL GPS SATELLITES" - sarcastic caption implying these cell towers are what actually provide GPS signals, not satellites orbiting in space. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SATELLITES: Flat Earth model often claims satellites don't exist - space is fake, rockets can't reach "space" (which doesn't exist as described), everything attributed to satellites is actually done by ground-based infrastructure, high-altitude balloons, or other terrestrial technology. 2) GPS IS GROUND-BASED: Flat Earthers claim GPS works through network of ground towers (like cell towers), not 24+ orbiting satellites. Argument suggests: Government claims satellites but actually uses towers; we're told signals come from space but they come from terrestrial network; whole satellite narrative is cover story for flat Earth. 3) "THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING": If satellites are fake, then satellite photos of spherical Earth are fake, satellite communications are lie, space exploration is hoax, etc. Discrediting satellite technology supports broader flat Earth narrative that all space-related evidence for spherical Earth is fabricated. TECHNICAL REALITY - Why This Is Wrong: 1) CELL TOWERS ≠ GPS: Cell towers provide CELLULAR communications (phone calls, text messages, mobile data). GPS is SEPARATE system using dedicated satellites (not cell towers). These are different technologies serving different purposes. Cell phones CAN use cell tower triangulation for approximate location (cellular location services), but this is less accurate than GPS and different technology. 2) GPS SATELLITE SYSTEM: GPS (Global Positioning System) uses constellation of 24-32 satellites orbiting at approximately 20,200 km (12,550 miles) altitude. Each satellite broadcasts precise time signal and orbital position. GPS receivers calculate position by measuring time delays from multiple satellites (minimum 4) and solving geometric equations. This requires satellites at high altitude to provide wide coverage - ground towers couldn't provide GPS coverage over oceans, deserts, polar regions, mountains. 3) GPS ACCURACY: GPS provides meter-level accuracy globally, including over oceans thousands of miles from any land (and thus any cell towers). Ships, aircraft, hikers in wilderness, military operations in remote areas all use GPS where no cell towers exist. If GPS required ground towers, it wouldn't work in these locations - but it does. 4) OBSERVABLE SATELLITES: GPS satellites (and other satellites) can be: Tracked by amateur astronomers using telescopes; observed as moving points of light at dawn/dusk when sun illuminates them against dark sky; tracked by amateur radio operators who receive and decode their signals; located using apps showing real-time satellite positions (easily verified by looking at sky when app indicates satellite overhead). 5) INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS: Multiple countries operate independent satellite navigation systems: US GPS, Russian GLONASS, European Galileo, Chinese BeiDou, Indian NavIC, Japanese QZSS. Each country launched its own satellites, operates its own ground control, provides its own signals. Would require impossible international conspiracy for all these competing nations to fake satellite systems while actually using ground towers. 6) ORBITAL MECHANICS: Satellite positions predicted by Newtonian/Keplerian orbital mechanics - same physics explaining Moon orbit, planetary motion. Predictions verified by tracking satellites over decades. If satellites didn't exist or weren't where predicted, these calculations would fail - but they work precisely, confirming satellite locations. 7) LAUNCH VISIBILITY: Satellite launches visible to public - SpaceX launches from Florida/California watched by thousands of spectators who see rocket ascending, stage separation, satellites deploying. International Space Station visible to naked eye orbiting overhead. Claiming satellites don't exist requires dismissing direct observations by millions of people. CELL TOWER CAPABILITIES: Cell towers have limited range (few miles per tower), require line-of-sight, form networks that hand off signals as users move between coverage areas. Network designed for relatively small geographic areas with dense tower deployment in populated regions. Utterly incapable of providing global positioning across oceans, wilderness, or areas without tower infrastructure. Comparing cell tower to GPS satellite is fundamental misunderstanding of both technologies. IRONY: Image creator probably uses GPS daily (smartphone maps, navigation apps, vehicle GPS) without considering how signal reaches them over oceans during overseas flights, in national parks miles from cell service, or in rural areas with no towers visible. GPS working in these tower-free locations directly contradicts meme's claim. VISUAL RHETORIC: Meme works by: 1) Showing familiar infrastructure (cell tower) that audience has seen. 2) Labeling it with unfamiliar term ("satellites") creating dissonance. 3) Implying switch/revelation - what you thought were satellites are actually just towers. 4) Supporting broader flat Earth narrative that authorities lie about technology. Format is simple, shareable, requires no detailed argument. Works as thought-terminating image - instead of researching GPS technology, viewer remembers "satellites are really just towers" and dismisses satellite evidence. Effectiveness depends on audience's technical ignorance - anyone who understands GPS technology immediately recognizes image as nonsensical. But for those unfamiliar with how GPS works, meme plants seed of doubt about satellite reality. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) confirms this is propaganda supporting flat Earth narrative by attacking credibility of satellite technology and, by extension, any satellite-based evidence for spherical Earth. Meme conflates different technologies, ignores physics of GPS operation, and relies on audience not investigating actual GPS satellite system.5:T1bba,NASA Earth images comparison claiming inconsistency between Blue Marble photographs proves images are computer-generated simulations, not real photographs. Grid layout comparing official NASA Earth images from different dates with simulated globe renderings, suggesting NASA fabricates Earth imagery because continent sizes appear different. Flat Earth argument that Earth photos are CGI/Photoshop, not genuine photographs from space. IMAGE LAYOUT: Seven globe images arranged in grid format against black background. Left column labeled "NASA VERSION" shows two official NASA photographs. Right section shows five "simulation" globes for comparison. Explanatory text at top right reads: "Simulation of the globe on the dates the images were taken and remastered." LEFT COLUMN - NASA IMAGES: TOP LEFT GLOBE: Labeled "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972 01/04/2012" - Famous "Blue Marble" photograph from Apollo 17 mission (December 7, 1972) compared with 2012 image. Shows Earth with Africa prominently visible, blue oceans, white cloud formations. This is one of most famous photographs ever taken - full Earth illuminated by sun behind camera during Apollo 17's journey to moon. Image shows Earth from approximately 28,000 miles away. Classic view with Africa, Arabia, Antarctica visible. BOTTOM LEFT GLOBE: Another NASA Earth image, appearing similar to top image but potentially different date/source. Shows similar view of Africa-centered hemisphere with cloud patterns and ocean colors. Both NASA images show blue planet with recognizable continental shapes, white clouds, atmospheric haze at edges. RIGHT SECTION - SIMULATION COMPARISON: Five computer-generated globe models showing Earth on specific dates for comparison with NASA photographs. Row 1: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - simulations showing expected appearance on dates NASA images were supposedly taken. Row 2: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - additional simulation views. Simulations appear to use satellite/map data projected onto sphere to show expected Earth appearance on specific dates. PURPOSE OF COMPARISON: Image creator attempts to show discrepancies between NASA photographs and computer simulations of Earth on same dates. Implication: If NASA photos were genuine, they should exactly match simulations of Earth's appearance. Any differences suggest NASA photos are fabricated/manipulated. Flat Earth community argues NASA images show Africa at different sizes, continent shapes vary between photos, cloud patterns impossible, etc. - "proving" images are computer-generated rather than genuine photographs. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NASA LIES: Space agency fabricates imagery rather than photographing real spherical Earth (which flat Earthers believe doesn't exist). All "Earth from space" photos are CGI, Photoshop, composites, or studio shots. 2) INCONSISTENCY PROVES FAKERY: If Earth photos were real, they'd be consistent. Variations between images (continent size, color, cloud patterns) prove manipulation. Real photographs would show identical planet; CGI introduces errors. 3) TECHNOLOGY WASN'T AVAILABLE: In 1972, digital manipulation wasn't possible, but flat Earthers claim photos were faked using other techniques (paintings, models, studio work). Modern images are CGI because technology now exists. 4) BLUE MARBLE ADMITTED COMPOSITE: NASA has stated that many modern Earth images are composites from multiple satellite passes stitched together. Flat Earthers interpret any compositing as proof of total fakery - if any manipulation occurs, entire image is fabricated. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) DIFFERENT DISTANCES/PERSPECTIVES: Earth photos from different distances show continents at different apparent sizes due to perspective. Apollo 17 was ~28,000 miles from Earth; satellites orbit at various altitudes (250-22,000+ miles). Closer = different perspective on curved surface. 2) CAMERA/LENS DIFFERENCES: Different cameras, lenses, focal lengths produce different results. Fish-eye vs telephoto lenses change apparent curvature and proportion. Comparing images from different cameras isn't valid test of authenticity. 3) ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS: Cloud cover, atmospheric clarity, lighting angle all change Earth's appearance. No two photographs of Earth will be identical because conditions constantly change. Demanding identical images misunderstands photography. 4) COMPOSITE VS FAKE: Yes, some NASA images are composites - multiple photos stitched together for higher resolution or to show features normally not visible together. Composite is standard photographic technique, not evidence of fabrication. Panoramic photos, HDR images, focus stacking are all "composites" - doesn't make them fake. 5) MULTIPLE SOURCES: Earth images come from NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China), ISRO (India), Roscosmos (Russia), private companies (SpaceX, Planet Labs), amateur radio operators, weather balloons, etc. Would require global conspiracy among competing/adversarial nations to all produce consistent "fake" spherical Earth images. 6) LIVE FEEDS: ISS provides live video feed showing Earth. Weather satellites provide continuous imagery. These aren't single photos that could be fabricated - they're ongoing streams matching weather patterns, day/night cycles, seasonal changes in real time. 7) YOU CAN VERIFY: Amateur astronomers photograph ISS passing overhead. High-altitude balloon enthusiasts photograph Earth's curvature. Anyone with sufficient resources can launch balloon camera and see curvature themselves. No reliance on NASA required. SPECIFIC IMAGE ANALYSIS: The 1972 Blue Marble is genuine photograph taken by astronauts on film camera during Apollo 17 mission. Original film exists, has been examined, shows no evidence of manipulation. Africa appears "large" because camera was positioned to center Africa in frame - this is normal perspective effect when photographing sphere up close. Claiming Africa looks "different size" in different photos fails to account for: distance from Earth, camera position, lens focal length, and perspective geometry of photographing curved surfaces. ATTRIBUTION: "fb.com/aterraeplana" visible in bottom left - Portuguese flat Earth community page (terra plana = flat earth in Portuguese). Indicates this is flat Earth propaganda image designed to cast doubt on NASA imagery by creating false expectation that all Earth photos should look identical regardless of when, where, and how they were taken. VISUAL RHETORIC: Grid layout suggests systematic comparison/analysis. Side-by-side format implies equivalence between NASA photos and simulations. Labeling with specific dates creates impression of scientific rigor. But comparison is fundamentally flawed - expecting photographs taken under different conditions to be identical demonstrates misunderstanding of photography, perspective, and the physical process of imaging a sphere from different distances and angles. Image designed to create doubt through apparent inconsistency while ignoring explanations for normal variation between photographs.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-381","title":"Other 381","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12916949_483617311838008_9044399751281064854_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-380","title":"Other 380","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12901389_486065631593176_2750884562270147089_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-382","title":"Other 382","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12923279_481720352027704_2274777867548518658_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
