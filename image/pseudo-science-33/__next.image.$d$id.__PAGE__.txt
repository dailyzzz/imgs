3:T4bb,Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipment. Background shows green chalkboard covered with white chemical formulas and equations (CH³, HB₃, Log, Ph²). Foreground displays colorful chemistry glassware: conical flasks with blue, red/orange, clear liquids, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers with colored solutions on wooden lab bench. Top text in large white letters: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED'. Bottom text: 'THAT YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED.' Satirical meta-commentary on public trust in scientific authority and announcements. Can be interpreted multiple ways: critique of blind faith in science without understanding methodology, skepticism about sensationalized science journalism, or anti-science sentiment questioning all scientific findings. In flat Earth context, used to argue people uncritically accept mainstream scientific claims (like globe Earth) without personal verification. Ironically, meme itself relies on comedic appeal rather than reasoned argument, using cute cat to make philosophical point about epistemology and trust in expert authority.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-33","title":"Pseudo Science 33","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/48412960_2290666314297442_5016630150867976192_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-32","title":"Pseudo Science 32","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46470458_10212799227198744_2174079361102118912_n-1.jpeg","description":"Two-panel educational meme titled 'Experiments Prove Earth at Rest' showing table with five experiments and their proofs: Airy's Failure (Starlight moves, Telescope remains stationary), Michelson-Morley (No rotation of earth), Michelson-Gale (Aether moves, not earth), Sagnac (Light travels through the aether, No vacuum exists), Bedford Level (Zero curvature in 6 miles of canal) with technical diagrams on right side.
