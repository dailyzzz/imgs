5:T4bb,Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipment. Background shows green chalkboard covered with white chemical formulas and equations (CH³, HB₃, Log, Ph²). Foreground displays colorful chemistry glassware: conical flasks with blue, red/orange, clear liquids, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers with colored solutions on wooden lab bench. Top text in large white letters: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED'. Bottom text: 'THAT YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED.' Satirical meta-commentary on public trust in scientific authority and announcements. Can be interpreted multiple ways: critique of blind faith in science without understanding methodology, skepticism about sensationalized science journalism, or anti-science sentiment questioning all scientific findings. In flat Earth context, used to argue people uncritically accept mainstream scientific claims (like globe Earth) without personal verification. Ironically, meme itself relies on comedic appeal rather than reasoned argument, using cute cat to make philosophical point about epistemology and trust in expert authority.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 33 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipm..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pseudo Science 33"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipm..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/48412960_2290666314297442_5016630150867976192_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 33"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipm..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/48412960_2290666314297442_5016630150867976192_n.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
