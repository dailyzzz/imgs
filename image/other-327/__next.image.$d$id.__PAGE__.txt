3:Ta9f,Facebook notification meme showing social media activity explosion after discovering flat Earth. Humorous meme depicting dramatic increase in Facebook notifications after becoming flat Earth believer. Blue Facebook-themed background mimics social media interface. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'BEFORE DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Upper section shows Facebook interface elements in darker blue silhouette style: left shows two-person icon (friends/people), center shows speech bubble icon (messages), right shows globe/world icon (notifications) with small red notification badge showing number '7' suggesting minimal activity. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'AFTER DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Lower section shows same three Facebook icons but with dramatically increased notification numbers in bright orange-red badges: friends icon shows '419', messages icon shows '91', globe/notifications icon shows '134' - representing exponential increase in social media engagement. Meme humorously captures experience of flat Earth believers who become extremely active in online debates and discussions. After discovering flat Earth theory, person presumably begins posting about it frequently, leading to flood of responses from friends, family, and strangers. High notification counts suggest: 1) Friend requests or tags from other flat Earthers (419), 2) Direct messages from people debating or questioning beliefs (91), 3) Post notifications from intense comment threads (134). Meme resonates because flat Earth believers often report becoming consumed by topic, spending hours in online debates, watching conspiracy videos, joining Facebook groups, commenting on mainstream science posts. Controversial beliefs naturally generate engagement - mix of fellow believers providing encouragement and skeptics offering counterarguments. Many report losing friendships or facing social consequences but finding new community among fellow believers. Humorous tone suggests self-awareness about obsessive engagement. Format reflects reality that conspiracy theory beliefs often accompanied by intense online activity - researching 'evidence', sharing memes, debating critics, seeking validation from like-minded individuals. Social media algorithms may amplify this by showing more flat Earth content once user engages with it, creating echo chamber effect. Psychology research shows conspiracy theory believers often form tight-knit online communities where shared marginalized beliefs create strong social bonds. Meme functions as both self-deprecating humor and implicit brag about dedication to 'truth-seeking' despite social pushback4:Tcd5,Apollo 11 moon landing hoax claims collage showing alleged impossibilities. Three-panel infographic questioning authenticity of Apollo 11 lunar landing photographs. Title banner across top in italicized serif font on gold/tan background: 'Apollo 11' (left) and 'IMPOSSIBILITIES' (right). Top left panel shows gold/tan background with black text: 'Module's Descent Engine with a thrust of up to 5 tons LEFT NO LANDING CRATER'. Top center displays iconic Apollo 11 Lunar Module photograph on moon's surface. Gold-foil wrapped descent stage with ladder visible, four landing pads resting on gray lunar regolith. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible on lunar surface. American flag planted nearby. Surface shows gray moon dust with footprints. Black sky above. Scene shows characteristic harsh lighting and shadows from unfiltered sunlight. Top right panel on gold/tan background states: 'LANDING FOOT WITH NO TRACE OF MOON DUST' (likely lowered by a crane in place on the movie set)' - parenthetical suggests film set rather than moon. Bottom left shows close-up photograph of Lunar Module descent stage from below - golden-foil thermal insulation with 'UNITED STATES' text visible, structural supports, thruster bells pointing downward. Harsh shadows visible on surface below. No visible blast crater beneath engine despite claimed 5-ton thrust. Bottom center shows 'Deesillustration.com' watermark. Bottom right displays close-up photograph of LM landing pad foot - circular dish-shaped foot covered in crinkled gold foil, approximately 3 feet diameter. Pad sits on gray lunar surface with disturbed regolith around it showing compression pattern. Surrounding surface appears dusty and disturbed but landing pad itself appears relatively clean without thick coating of dust. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Collage presents common moon landing hoax arguments: 1) Descent engine's 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust should have created crater in lunar surface, 2) Landing pads should be covered in moon dust blown during landing. However, both claims misunderstand lunar conditions: 1) Lunar surface is hard compacted regolith beneath thin dust layer - not soft like beach sand. Engine throttled down to ~3,000 lbf during final descent to reduce impact. Exhaust dispersed across wide area creating shallow depression visible in photos but not deep crater. Vacuum environment means no air to create turbulent blast. 2) Dust WAS disturbed during landing (visible in film footage as spray radiating outward), but in vacuum with no air resistance, dust particles followed ballistic trajectories away from landing site rather than settling back on pads. Some dust accumulated but not thick coating. Landing pads show expected appearance given vacuum environment physics. Multiple independent analyses of Apollo photos, lunar samples (842 pounds returned), retroreflectors placed on moon still used for laser ranging, testimony from 400,000 NASA workers, verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary tracking missions), satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible all confirm moon landings occurred. Photograph analysis claiming 'impossibilities' misunderstands lunar environment physics or applies Earth-based intuitions to airless low-gravity conditions5:Tbd4,NASA logo tattoo photograph with humorous mock regret message. Photograph showing person's leg with permanent NASA tattoo accompanied by text mocking their decision. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY JUST REMEMBER'. Central image shows close-up of person's lower leg/calf area. Person wears dark gray or black pants rolled up to mid-calf, green sock pulled down to ankle, and black sneaker. Skin visible on calf shows large tattoo of NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circular background with red chevron wing, white 'NASA' text, white stars, and orbital trajectory line. Tattoo appears professionally done with clean lines and solid colors, approximately 4-5 inches diameter covering significant portion of calf. Colors vibrant and distinct - deep blue background, bright red chevron, clean white elements. Tattoo relatively new based on sharp appearance without fading. Background shows indoor setting with beige/tan speckled floor (appears to be commercial flooring like restaurant, office, or public building) and dark wooden furniture leg visible on left. Lighting suggests indoor fluorescent or LED illumination. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'YOU COULD BE THIS GUY'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme mocks person who got permanent NASA tattoo, suggesting they'll regret decision once they 'learn the truth' about space agency. Flat Earth community views NASA as primary organization perpetuating globe Earth 'lie' through fake space missions, CGI images, propaganda. Implies person blindly trusted NASA enough to permanently ink logo on body but will eventually discover agency is fraudulent, leaving them with embarrassing permanent reminder of their 'gullibility'. Humor derives from imagined future regret - being stuck with NASA tattoo after becoming flat Earth believer would create awkward situation. Would require expensive laser removal, cover-up tattoo, or living with constant reminder of former beliefs. Format of 'having a bad day? at least you're not this guy' is common meme template for schadenfreude - taking comfort in others' misfortunes or poor decisions. However, NASA has successfully executed numerous space missions over 60+ years providing satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting, Earth observation, planetary exploration, International Space Station operations. Thousands of photos, livestreams, returned samples, astronaut testimony from multiple nations all confirm space agency's accomplishments. Person with NASA tattoo likely space enthusiast, employee, or someone inspired by scientific achievement. From mainstream perspective, NASA tattoo represents admiration for human achievement, scientific progress, space exploration - nothing to regret. Only within flat Earth worldview does tattoo become embarrassing. Meme reveals flat Earth community's certainty that their beliefs are correct and others will eventually recognize it, experiencing regret for supporting mainstream science0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-327","title":"Other 327","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795299_468758903323849_6910434711150921852_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-326","title":"Other 326","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795283_471213729745033_7497933477636279075_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-328","title":"Other 328","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795399_469306029935803_3961592836711624466_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
