3:T462,Massive tabular iceberg in Antarctic waters showing ice wall concept. Photograph shows enormous flat-topped iceberg with perfectly level horizontal surface. Ice formation appears bright white with subtle blue tints. Top surface remarkably flat and smooth like tabletop extending across width of image. Vertical ice cliff face shows horizontal stratification layers from snow/ice compression over millennia. Face appears sheer and perpendicular to water surface. Small chunks of broken ice visible at waterline. Dark gray-blue ocean water in foreground shows gentle waves and ripples. Overcast gray sky creates moody atmosphere. Background shows more ice formations fading into atmospheric haze. Tabular icebergs form when large sections break off Antarctic ice shelf. This type commonly cited by flat Earth proponents as evidence of ice wall surrounding Earth's edge. Argues Antarctica isn't continent at bottom of globe but circular ice wall encircling flat Earth plane, preventing water from flowing off edges and keeping civilizations contained in center disk. Perfectly flat top surface reinforces flat plane cosmology4:T4ce,Shel Silverstein 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' book cover with flat Earth edge imagery. Cream/beige aged paper background. Top text in serif font: 'the poems and drawings of Shel Silverstein'. Classic black ink line drawing shows whimsical scene of child and dog at literal edge of sidewalk/world. Left side has wooden signpost reading 'EDGE KEEP OFF'. Girl with pigtails wearing dress sits on edge of flat surface/cliff holding rope or leash. Small scruffy dog dangles over edge holding onto rope with mouth. Various small objects (shoes, items) fall into void below. Empty white space below represents drop-off into nothingness. Right side shows scraggly vegetation/grass. Bottom shows large black serif text: 'Where the Sidewalk Ends'. Famous 1974 children's poetry collection by Shel Silverstein. Original book about imagination and adventure where normal world ends. Flat Earth proponents use this imagery literally - suggesting Silverstein illustrated actual Earth's edge where civilization (sidewalk) meets boundary (ice wall/Antarctica). Child's innocent perspective represents truth hidden in plain sight in children's literature. Argues mainstream culture subconsciously knows Earth is flat, embedded in cultural touchstones5:T4ff,Beach sunset silhouette with water level proverb. Shows peaceful beach scene at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from blue-gray at top transitioning through orange-yellow tones to bright golden sun at horizon. Sun partially visible above horizon line creating bright reflection column stretching across wet sand/shallow water toward viewer. Calm water or wet sand creates mirror-like surface reflecting sky colors. Three silhouetted figures in foreground - adult standing on left leading horse by rope/reins, small child in middle, horse on right walking through shallow water. All figures appear as black silhouettes against illuminated background. Reflections visible in wet sand below. Horizon appears perfectly flat where sky meets water/land. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN LEAD A MAN TO WATER'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM SEE IT ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL AND FLAT'. Left side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Parodies 'you can lead a horse to water but can't make him drink' proverb. Argues truth about water's levelness (and by extension flat Earth) is obvious to those willing to observe, but many refuse to see despite evidence right in front of them. Uses horse leading metaphor for futility of convincing closed-minded people0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-186","title":"Other 186","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525409_461770357356037_945031612290821477_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-185","title":"Other 185","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525377_455802321286174_1896089488163690549_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-187","title":"Other 187","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525466_477585052441234_5437057402681444586_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
