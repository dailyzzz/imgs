5:T462,Massive tabular iceberg in Antarctic waters showing ice wall concept. Photograph shows enormous flat-topped iceberg with perfectly level horizontal surface. Ice formation appears bright white with subtle blue tints. Top surface remarkably flat and smooth like tabletop extending across width of image. Vertical ice cliff face shows horizontal stratification layers from snow/ice compression over millennia. Face appears sheer and perpendicular to water surface. Small chunks of broken ice visible at waterline. Dark gray-blue ocean water in foreground shows gentle waves and ripples. Overcast gray sky creates moody atmosphere. Background shows more ice formations fading into atmospheric haze. Tabular icebergs form when large sections break off Antarctic ice shelf. This type commonly cited by flat Earth proponents as evidence of ice wall surrounding Earth's edge. Argues Antarctica isn't continent at bottom of globe but circular ice wall encircling flat Earth plane, preventing water from flowing off edges and keeping civilizations contained in center disk. Perfectly flat top surface reinforces flat plane cosmology0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 186 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Massive tabular iceberg in Antarctic waters showing ice wall concept.
