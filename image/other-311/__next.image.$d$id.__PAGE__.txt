3:T9fc,Bruce Lee water philosophy meme adapted for flat Earth argument about water taking container shape. Black and white photograph of martial arts legend Bruce Lee with modified version of his famous 'be like water' philosophy applied to flat Earth claims. Top text in large white letters with gray outline: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows professional studio portrait of Bruce Lee - young Asian man with distinctive short dark hair, intense focused gaze, strong features, wearing light colored button-up collared shirt and dark striped tie. High contrast black and white photography creates dramatic effect emphasizing his serious, contemplative expression. Background plain gray. Text overlay on right side in white with gray outline: 'If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.' Line break, then: 'You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. You put water on a ball, it falls off.' Quote modifies Bruce Lee's iconic philosophy from interview/documentary where he described adaptability using water metaphor: 'Be water, my friend.' Original quote explained water's ability to conform to any container, flow around obstacles, crash through barriers - representing martial arts philosophy of adaptation and formlessness. This version adds final line 'You put water on a ball, it falls off' to suggest water cannot conform to spherical surface, therefore Earth cannot be sphere. Classic flat Earth argument about water adhering to curves. However, modification misunderstands both Bruce Lee's philosophy and physics. Water DOES conform to spherical surfaces when gravity acts toward center. On Earth-sized sphere, gravity pulls water molecules toward core creating curved ocean surface that appears locally level. Water in cup/bottle/teapot conforms due to gravity pulling down plus container walls constraining laterally. On sphere, water conforms due to gravity pulling radially inward toward center - no container walls needed. Small amounts of water on basketball-sized ball fall off due to surface tension being too weak to overcome gravity pulling straight down, but on planetary scale, gravity's radial pull toward center keeps oceans attached. Water on Earth curves following spherical surface - demonstrated by ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon. Misappropriating Bruce Lee's philosophy for flat Earth argument contradicts his actual message about adaptation, flexibility, understanding nature's principles4:T91c,Spherical trigonometry calculations chart proving Earth curvature using AutoCAD precision. Complex mathematical infographic calculating hidden heights due to Earth's curvature across various distances. Title at top: 'SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY OF A SPHERE WITH 3959 MILES RADIUS PROVING THERE IS NO 8" PER MILE SQUARED RULE FOR A BALL EARTH (USING AutoCAD 2016 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Header text 'SAR 2/' upper right. Below title shows 'Merriam-Webster Definition: Sphere' with definition text 'A solid that is bounded by a surface consisting of all points at a given distance from a point constituting its center' next to small diagram of sphere labeled 'The Imaginary Ball Earth'. Main left portion displays NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Western Hemisphere with North and South America visible, Pacific Ocean, white clouds, appearing as sphere. Overlaid on Earth image: red horizontal line labeled 'SURFACE LINE 3959 MILES RADIUS' extending across hemisphere, yellow arc labeled '$3959 MILES RADIUS' curving from center, compass rose showing cardinal directions, distance scale showing 0-1000-2000-3000-3959 miles. Right side contains extensive data table with columns labeled 'Distance in Miles', 'By Google's Calculator', 'Sagitta (Hidden Height) (Using AutoCAD)', 'By Trig Formula'. Table lists distances from 1 mile to 3170 miles with corresponding calculations showing hidden height due to curvature. Values progress from tiny amounts (1 mile = 0.67 feet hidden) to massive amounts (3170 miles = 1,286,112.00 feet hidden). Bottom shows Excel formula: 'X=3959*(COS(Sin^-1(L/3959))))' and 'The Trig ©=Sin^-1(L/R) X=R-R(Cos(©))'. Credits 'S. Valente, M. Kahnke, Z. Mrabet, jan/22/2016'. Chart demonstrates rigorous mathematical calculation of Earth's curvature using spherical geometry. Shows that for 3959-mile radius sphere (Earth's mean radius), specific amounts of height become hidden at various distances. For example, at 3 miles = 6 feet hidden, at 100 miles = 6668 feet hidden. Calculations use proper spherical trigonometry rather than simplified '8 inches per mile squared' approximation. The '8 inch rule' is rough estimate only accurate for short distances - actual curvature formula more complex. Chart proves mathematically that if Earth is sphere with ~4000 mile radius, substantial curvature exists5:T8f1,AI-generated children studying flat Earth azimuthal equidistant projection map. Digital artwork showing diverse group of children examining flat Earth model in futuristic educational setting. Five children gathered around table studying illuminated flat Earth map displayed on tilted stand resembling decorative globe mount. Children appear ages 8-12, showing racial diversity - mix of skin tones from light to dark. All wear matching gray-blue uniforms with green glowing circuit-pattern designs on sleeves suggesting futuristic/sci-fi school setting. Girl on left with braided hair points at map with finger, appears engaged. Three children stand/lean over map from various angles. Girl on right with ponytail wearing green earrings observes. All show curious, focused expressions studying the map. Central focus: azimuthal equidistant projection map showing flat Earth disc with North Pole at center. Map displays blue oceans, yellow-green-brown continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia visible radiating from center), white ice around perimeter representing Antarctica. Map mounted on brass/golden colored gimbal-style stand with degree markings around outer ring, suggesting navigational instrument. Small spherical objects attached to mount possibly representing sun and moon. Map surface illuminated with glowing effect. Background shows institutional setting with teal-blue brick walls, yellow-green neon light strip on wall creating atmospheric lighting. Visible emblem or logo on wall (left) showing globe with orbital rings and text. Wooden table surface. Lower left shows 'DDees.com' signature indicating digital art origin. Image appears AI-generated based on slight uncanny valley characteristics, overly smooth skin textures, slightly imperfect anatomy, perfect uniformity of clothing, idealized futuristic aesthetic. Artwork presents flat Earth education in positive, progressive light - suggesting advanced future where children learn 'truth' about flat Earth. However, azimuthal equidistant projection shown is legitimate cartographic projection of spherical Earth (used by UN logo, aviation planning, radio communications) - represents mathematical transformation of 3D sphere onto 2D plane for specific purposes, not proof of flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-311","title":"Other 311","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764808_467925800073826_2315618439056180762_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-310","title":"Other 310","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764408_467334173466322_8797735789174496278_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-312","title":"Other 312","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771784_470962913103448_1071833718786072481_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
