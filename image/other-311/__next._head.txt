5:T9fc,Bruce Lee water philosophy meme adapted for flat Earth argument about water taking container shape. Black and white photograph of martial arts legend Bruce Lee with modified version of his famous 'be like water' philosophy applied to flat Earth claims. Top text in large white letters with gray outline: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows professional studio portrait of Bruce Lee - young Asian man with distinctive short dark hair, intense focused gaze, strong features, wearing light colored button-up collared shirt and dark striped tie. High contrast black and white photography creates dramatic effect emphasizing his serious, contemplative expression. Background plain gray. Text overlay on right side in white with gray outline: 'If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.' Line break, then: 'You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. You put water on a ball, it falls off.' Quote modifies Bruce Lee's iconic philosophy from interview/documentary where he described adaptability using water metaphor: 'Be water, my friend.' Original quote explained water's ability to conform to any container, flow around obstacles, crash through barriers - representing martial arts philosophy of adaptation and formlessness. This version adds final line 'You put water on a ball, it falls off' to suggest water cannot conform to spherical surface, therefore Earth cannot be sphere. Classic flat Earth argument about water adhering to curves. However, modification misunderstands both Bruce Lee's philosophy and physics. Water DOES conform to spherical surfaces when gravity acts toward center. On Earth-sized sphere, gravity pulls water molecules toward core creating curved ocean surface that appears locally level. Water in cup/bottle/teapot conforms due to gravity pulling down plus container walls constraining laterally. On sphere, water conforms due to gravity pulling radially inward toward center - no container walls needed. Small amounts of water on basketball-sized ball fall off due to surface tension being too weak to overcome gravity pulling straight down, but on planetary scale, gravity's radial pull toward center keeps oceans attached. Water on Earth curves following spherical surface - demonstrated by ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon. Misappropriating Bruce Lee's philosophy for flat Earth argument contradicts his actual message about adaptation, flexibility, understanding nature's principles0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 311 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Bruce Lee water philosophy meme adapted for flat Earth argument about water taking container shape.
