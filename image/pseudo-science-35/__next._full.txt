Quote references Einstein's discussion of principle of relativity - that uniform motion cannot be detected through optical experiments conducted within moving reference frame (basis of special relativity). Meme presents this as contradiction: if Einstein admitted Earth's motion cannot be optically detected, how can his other theories (general relativity, spacetime curvature) prove spherical Earth? Misrepresents Einstein's work: inability to detect absolute motion doesn't mean Earth is stationary, rather that all inertial reference frames are equivalent and motion is relative. Einstein fully accepted heliocentric model and Earth's spherical shape; his relativity theories explain why uniform motion is undetectable while maintaining Earth orbits Sun.
