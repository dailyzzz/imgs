5:T855,Kyle meme collage about Earth shape apathy versus passionate truth-seekers. Complex multi-panel meme using 'Disappointed/Disgusted Kyle' template featuring numerous repeated images of same bald character. Background collage contains approximately 40+ instances of similar-looking bald male face in various situations - eating burgers, holding drinks (Starbucks cups visible), ice cream cones, phones, looking disgusted or disappointed. Some panels show magazine covers or advertisements. Character appears to be stock photo model used repeatedly across different scenarios. Images arranged in chaotic overlapping grid pattern filling entire frame. Top text in white with black outline: 'WHO CARES IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT COLD, HARD HOLLOW STARE OF THOSE THAT SIMPLY DON'T CARE'. Lower right corner shows red 'DOUBLE GLP' text and 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme contrasts two mindsets: apathetic mainstream person who doesn't question Earth's shape versus passionate truth-seeker who cares deeply about cosmological reality. 'Kyle' character represents stereotypical millennial consumer - bald, somewhat bland expression, frequently shown with consumer products (fast food, coffee, snacks). Repeated imagery creates unsettling effect suggesting mindless conformity and vacant disinterest. Flat Earth community uses this format to criticize what they perceive as intellectual laziness - people who accept conventional wisdom without investigation. Implies those who don't care about Earth's shape are empty, shallow, distracted by consumerism and trivial concerns. By contrast, flat Earthers position themselves as engaged critical thinkers pursuing truth regardless of social consequences. 'Cold, hard hollow stare' describes perceived vacancy in eyes of those who never questioned globe Earth model. However, most people accept spherical Earth based on abundant evidence rather than apathy - curvature visible from altitude, ships disappearing over horizon, circumnavigation, satellite communications, seasons, time zones, Foucault pendulum, stellar parallax, etc.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 271 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Kyle meme collage about Earth shape apathy versus passionate truth-seekers.
