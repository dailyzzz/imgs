3:T760,Historical newspaper article from Oamaru Mail, Volume XXVII, Issue 8305, dated 11 June 1904. Green header banner reads 'New Astronomical Theories' with subtitle 'Oamaru Mail, Volume XXVII, Issue 8305, 11 June 1904.' Article titled 'New Astronomical Theories' discusses flat Earth theory proposed by Mr. M'Clelland. Text excerpt: 'A correspondent in an American paper, writing from St. Catherines, Ontario, says it is asserted that on the Niagara peninsula, the truth still of Canada of which town is the centre, five out of six persons believe that the sun we live on is flat, and not spherical; and one of the proponents of the theory is John S. M'Clelland, city clerk of St. Catherines, formerly editor of a daily newspaper here. Mr M'Clelland is well educated and has made an earnest study of astronomy. After much investigation he concluded that the earth floats on water instead of air; that the sun is no bigger than it looks to the naked eye, and is only a few thousand miles above the earth. The sun, Mr M'Clelland thinks, rises from the ocean to shine on the world forth above it. The sun's intensity is not sufficient to heat the whole mass at once, and thus when it is at one end of the world the other end darkness and ice is accounted for. Mr M'Clelland points to the fact that the sun and moon are both seen shining at the same time, as unanswerable evidence that the earth is not a ball-like in shape. He scouts the gravitation theory. There Dr Hamilton of some sort draws, just like magnets. Another theory is merely an invention of astronomers to try to get out of a hole, as he calls it, that the earth is a globe.' Article continues discussing M'Clelland's theories about gravity, moon phases, and challenges to heliocentric model. Describes debate with Hamilton astronomer about whether Earth is flat.
