3:T42f,Complex educational infographic with black background titled 'WHY CAN'T I SEE CHINA OR MOUNT EVEREST?' at top in white text. Subtitle in smaller text: 'OH? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD SEE THROUGH BUILDINGS, HILLS, MOUNTAINS, 100 FOOT WAVES, DENSE WEATHER, HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS, POLLUTION, FOG, MIST, DUST PARTICLES, DENSE FLUID AIR, ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION AND LENSING, MAGNIFICATION AND SUPERIOR MIRAGE EFFECTS!' Four photographs illustrate atmospheric effects: top left shows hazy city skyline with person's silhouette, top right shows misty mountain layers, bottom left shows snowy landscape barely visible in whiteout conditions, bottom right shows hazy ocean horizon. White text sections: 'OR EVEN EYE-LEVEL HORIZONTAL RATE OF CONVERGENCE AND VANISHING POINT, DEPTH PERCEPTION, RAMPED AND LINEAR PERSPECTIVE, ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND PYRAMIDAL PERSPECTIVE!' and 'OR EVEN KNOWING HOW YOUR EYE VISUAL PERSPECTIVE RAMP ACTUALLY WORKS!' with 'A TRUTH TROOPER' orange logo.

Wet wooden planks reflect orange glowing street lamps that line both sides of walkway creating symmetrical pattern. Perspective lines of wooden railings converge toward vanishing point in distance where pier meets horizon over calm water. Large white text overlaid at bottom reads 'JUST PERSPECTIVE' with small 'Flat Earth Theorem' credit in bottom right corner. Image demonstrates linear perspective principle where parallel lines appear to converge at distance, used to argue against Earth curvature as explanation for objects appearing to sink below horizon."}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
