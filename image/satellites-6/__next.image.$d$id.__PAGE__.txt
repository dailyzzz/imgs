Search interface shows tabs (ALL, IMAGES, VIDEOS, NEWS, MAPS). Results display 5x5 grid of 25+ satellite images: various CGI renderings and artistic illustrations of satellites with solar panels orbiting Earth, ISS, communications satellites, GPS satellites, all showing polished 3D computer-generated appearance rather than actual photographs. Blue Earth with white clouds visible in many images. Black space backgrounds. Multiple duplicate or similar-looking satellite designs. Suggests all publicly available satellite imagery is computer-generated illustrations rather than authentic space photography, questioning existence or accessibility of real satellite photographs."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-5","title":"Satellites 5","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37238889_10211374744184237_7276320395001593856_n.jpeg","description":"Two-column comparison meme titled 'Places Where GPS Works' versus 'Places Where GPS Doesn't Work'. Left column shows urban/developed areas: city skyline with purple twilight (top), busy highway with traffic (middle), suburban residential neighborhood with houses (bottom left), paved road through orange desert landscape (bottom right). Right column shows remote natural areas: snow-capped mountain range peaks (top), orange/tan sand dunes desert (middle), dense green forest interior (bottom left), calm blue ocean/sea water (bottom right). Bottom text: 'The Further You Travel From Highways and Cities, The Harder It Is To Get A GPS Signal. Why Doesn't \"Worldwide Coverage\" Include Mountains, Deserts, Forests, And Oceans? It's Because You're Connecting To A Land Based Cell Tower With a 50 Mile Range. SATELLITES DO NOT EXIST.' Argues GPS relies on terrestrial cell towers rather than orbiting satellites, explaining why signal is lost in remote areas without infrastructure."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-7","title":"Satellites 7","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37265703_10160438868435532_1665488326255181824_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme challenging satellite necessity. Top panel shows workers on ship deck working with thick undersea cables, text: 'If the earth is round & we have 1000's of satellites orbiting the earth' with workers wearing hard hats (yellow, white, red) handling large black cables with yellow/gold striping on green deck. Bottom panel shows industrial cable spool machinery on dock or ship, large blue cable reel mounted on frame with cable feeding equipment, text: 'Why do we need over 250 undersea cables spanning continent to continent?' Argues that extensive undersea fiber optic cable infrastructure for global telecommunications contradicts claimed reliance on satellite network, questioning whether satellites are necessary or even exist if physical cables handle communication."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
