5:T964,Three-panel meme comparing physics astronomy and astrophysics conclusions. Composite image with three horizontal panels making claims about different scientific fields. Top panel shows 3D rendered flat Earth disc with glowing rim against starry black space background. Earth disc displays blue oceans, green-brown continents, white ice wall around perimeter. Sun shown as bright light source above and behind disc creating atmospheric glow and lens flare effects. Text overlay in white sans-serif font: 'Physics proves the Flat Earth'. Middle panel displays classical Renaissance religious painting showing Jesus Christ as teacher/scholar. Figure wears red and green robes, has brown hair, beard, peaceful expression, gestures with hands in teaching pose. Painting style suggests 16th-17th century European religious art with muted earth tones, classical composition. Background shows architectural elements. Text overlay: 'Astronomy proves God'. Bottom panel shows scientific visualization of spacetime curvature - abstract representation with pink-red curved grid surface warping into depression, suggesting gravitational effects on fabric of space. Grid lines curve downward showing massive object's effect on spacetime geometry. Visualization resembles illustrations of Einstein's general relativity. Bright light source visible creating dramatic effect. Bottom shows 'SPACETIME ODYSSEY' text. Main text overlay: 'Astrophysics proves the gullibility of the human being'. Lower portion credits 'fb.com/aterraeplana' with additional text 'With Astrophysical and Host Neil deGrasse Tyson' and 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'. Meme argues three scientific fields lead to contradictory conclusions: physics supposedly proves flat Earth, astronomy proves God's existence, astrophysics proves human gullibility. Implies scientific fields contradict each other, suggesting science untrustworthy. However, physics, astronomy, and astrophysics are interconnected disciplines using same fundamental principles - they don't contradict. All three confirm spherical Earth through: orbital mechanics, planetary observations, spacetime measurements, gravitational calculations. Reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' series suggests mainstream science promotes false narrative. Meme employs false trichotomy suggesting must choose between contradictory scientific conclusions when in reality they're complementary0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 295 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Three-panel meme comparing physics astronomy and astrophysics conclusions.
