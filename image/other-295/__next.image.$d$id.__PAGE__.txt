3:T964,Three-panel meme comparing physics astronomy and astrophysics conclusions. Composite image with three horizontal panels making claims about different scientific fields. Top panel shows 3D rendered flat Earth disc with glowing rim against starry black space background. Earth disc displays blue oceans, green-brown continents, white ice wall around perimeter. Sun shown as bright light source above and behind disc creating atmospheric glow and lens flare effects. Text overlay in white sans-serif font: 'Physics proves the Flat Earth'. Middle panel displays classical Renaissance religious painting showing Jesus Christ as teacher/scholar. Figure wears red and green robes, has brown hair, beard, peaceful expression, gestures with hands in teaching pose. Painting style suggests 16th-17th century European religious art with muted earth tones, classical composition. Background shows architectural elements. Text overlay: 'Astronomy proves God'. Bottom panel shows scientific visualization of spacetime curvature - abstract representation with pink-red curved grid surface warping into depression, suggesting gravitational effects on fabric of space. Grid lines curve downward showing massive object's effect on spacetime geometry. Visualization resembles illustrations of Einstein's general relativity. Bright light source visible creating dramatic effect. Bottom shows 'SPACETIME ODYSSEY' text. Main text overlay: 'Astrophysics proves the gullibility of the human being'. Lower portion credits 'fb.com/aterraeplana' with additional text 'With Astrophysical and Host Neil deGrasse Tyson' and 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'. Meme argues three scientific fields lead to contradictory conclusions: physics supposedly proves flat Earth, astronomy proves God's existence, astrophysics proves human gullibility. Implies scientific fields contradict each other, suggesting science untrustworthy. However, physics, astronomy, and astrophysics are interconnected disciplines using same fundamental principles - they don't contradict. All three confirm spherical Earth through: orbital mechanics, planetary observations, spacetime measurements, gravitational calculations. Reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' series suggests mainstream science promotes false narrative. Meme employs false trichotomy suggesting must choose between contradictory scientific conclusions when in reality they're complementary4:T80a,Pool balls on felt table sarcastic sphere logic meme. Satirical photograph mocking flawed reasoning about spheres and surfaces. Top text in large bold white letters: 'THESE POOL BALLS ARE SPHERES'. Image shows pool/billiards table with bright turquoise-blue felt surface. Cluster of standard pool balls (numbered 1-15) arranged in breaking formation - triangular rack pattern with balls touching. Balls show various solid and striped colors: white cue ball separate at left, yellow (1), blue (2), red (3), purple (4), orange (5), green (6), maroon/burgundy (7), black (8), yellow striped (9), blue striped (10), red striped (11), purple striped (12), orange striped (13), green striped (14), maroon striped (15). Balls highly polished with visible reflections and highlights showing spherical shape. Wooden cue stick visible at top right edge with brass ferrule and white tip. Lower right shows 'Flat Earth Matters' attribution in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'THIS TABLE MUST BE A SPHERE TOO'. Meme sarcastically mocks logical fallacy in flat Earth arguments. Format follows reductio ad absurdum - if pool balls being spheres means table must be spherical, then absurd conclusion reveals flawed logic. Parodies flat Earth reasoning patterns that make non-sequitur connections. However, meme actually strawmans globe Earth position - nobody claims Earth is sphere BECAUSE objects on it are spherical. Earth's sphericity determined by: measurements of curvature (ships disappearing hull-first), circumnavigation, satellite imagery, varying star visibility with latitude, Foucault pendulum, Eratosthenes' shadow measurements (240 BC), lunar eclipse shadows showing round Earth, physics of planetary formation (gravity pulls matter into spheres above certain mass). Objects' shapes don't determine surface shape - spherical objects rest on flat tables, flat papers rest on spherical Earth. Both work fine. Meme creates false equivalence between scale (small objects vs 12,742 km diameter planet) and misrepresents scientific reasoning5:T954,Flatbook Cosmology inner shell diagram with esoteric and alchemical symbolism. Complex infographic showing compartmentalized flat Earth model with mystical elements. Title at bottom in gray italics: 'FLATBOOK COSMOLOGY' with subtitle 'THE INNER SHELL'. Dark background with gray double-border frame. Central circular diagram shows flat Earth disc with blue ring (firmament/dome) viewed from above. Black interior shows continents in dark with subtle geographic outlines. White triangular mountain at center labeled 'THE HOLY MOUNTAIN' with small star above. Colored triangular symbols arranged around mountain: red downward triangle at bottom, pink/magenta triangles on sides, blue/green triangles, suggesting alchemical or esoteric directional markers. Circular band around disc labeled 'WATER ABOVE' at top semicircle. Section below mountain labeled 'THE UNDERWORLD'. Numerous labeled elements radiate outward with lines connecting to specific features: Upper left: Orange sun icon labeled 'SUN - THE FATHER & CONVERTER'. Upper area: Concentric circles labeled 'PLANETS' with orbital rings. Upper left quadrant: Yellow star labeled 'POLARIS - THE LODESTONE'. Top center: Yellow lightning bolt labeled 'PIEZOELECTRICITY'. Upper center: Beige semicircle with buildings/cityscape silhouette labeled 'WHITE WORK - FIRMAMENT'. Right side upper: Small TV/screen icon labeled 'GLASS SKY - ELECTROMAGNETIC LIGHTBULB'. Upper right: Crescent moon icon labeled 'MOON - THE CATHODE' with smaller moon phases. Far right: Small blue Antarctica icon. Lower right: Blue Earth sphere labeled 'ELECTRIC FLAT EARTH'. Right middle: Diagram showing 'CELESTIAL AXIS' with '23° INCLINATION' marked. Lower area: Red text 'RED WORK - LIFE ON EARTH'. Lower left: Spiral shell illustration labeled 'THE SHELL - THE EGG'. Bottom left: Gray symbols labeled 'BLACK WORK - PUTREFACTION'. Cosmology blends multiple esoteric traditions: alchemical color stages (Nigredo/black, Albedo/white, Rubedo/red), sacred geometry, electric universe theory, biblical cosmology, hermetic principles. Suggests Earth as cosmic egg within layered shell structure with electric/electromagnetic properties. References piezoelectricity, glass sky dome concept, electric Earth theory. However, model conflicts with observable physics, satellite communications, GPS functionality, circumnavigation, planetary motions, gravity measurements0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-295","title":"Other 295","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12743640_465617443637995_4398938829548486463_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-294","title":"Other 294","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742737_468137263386013_8988751100282107941_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-296","title":"Other 296","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744307_464902377042835_3470945716002811040_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
