3:T4a7,Meme about educational indoctrination featuring young student in vintage classroom setting. Shows boy with dark curly hair wearing white collared shirt with dark trim, resting face on hand with bored or skeptical expression while sitting at wooden school desk. Behind him visible green chalkboard with mathematical equations or writing in chalk. Aged photograph quality with muted bluish-gray tones gives nostalgic 1960s-70s classroom atmosphere. Top banner in gray reads 'THEY LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING' in white text. Bottom section shows red banner with white text quote: 'Illiteracy in the 21st century will not be about reading and writing, but about those who cannot unlearn what they were led to believe.' Attribution watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana' at bottom left. Argues modern education system indoctrinates rather than educates, specifically regarding globe Earth model. Suggests true literacy/intelligence requires ability to question and unlearn false information taught in schools. Uses disengaged student image to represent those trapped in educational programming. Quote emphasizes critical thinking and willingness to reject mainstream narratives as markers of genuine education4:T476,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Coriolis Effect. Title at top reads 'The Coriolis Effect' in elegant gray font. Top panel shows military sniper in white winter camouflage and face covering looking through scope of large tactical rifle with suppressor, lying in prone shooting position. Snow or winter environment visible. White text overlay: 'SAYS THE EARTH SPINS UNDER A SNIPER'S BULLET'. Bottom panel shows vibrant collection of colorful hot air balloons floating in clear blue sky - including yellow/blue striped balloon on left, orange/black striped large balloon in center, blue balloon with stars, red balloon, balloons in various colors (yellow, green, blue, red, orange patterns). White text overlay: 'BUT IT DOESN'T SPIN UNDER THESE BALLOONS?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in cyan at bottom right. Meme argues if Coriolis Effect (Earth's rotation affecting moving objects) requires snipers to compensate for Earth's rotation when shooting long distances, then stationary hot air balloons should drift due to same rotation. Questions why balloons don't experience apparent motion if Earth rotates beneath them while suspended in air0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-123","title":"Other 123","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12235136_476978399168566_5513070256571606414_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-122","title":"Other 122","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12027550_476085282591211_231428007959650899_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-124","title":"Other 124","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12307440_439888942877512_731251387358927024_o.jpg","description":"Dramatic seascape photograph with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text overlay in large bold white letters across lower third. Shows powerful ocean scene with dark gray storm clouds dominating upper half of image. Brilliant golden-orange sunlight breaks through gaps in clouds creating dramatic crepuscular rays (god rays) streaming down through atmosphere. Rays appear to converge and diverge from breaks in cloud cover. Middle section shows darker gray clouds with bright yellow-orange illumination behind them. Lower portion shows calm blue-gray ocean water extending to horizon line. Horizon appears perfectly flat and level where water meets sky. Image uses dramatic natural lighting and atmospheric effects to create visually striking composition supporting flat Earth messaging. Crepuscular rays create sense of sun being relatively close to Earth rather than 93 million miles away"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
