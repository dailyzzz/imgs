3:T4a2,Serene waterscape photograph with hashtag '#ProveWaterToBeConvex' at top. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene with wooden pier posts or pilings extending into perfectly calm water creating mirror reflections. Row of weathered wooden posts visible on left side of image stretching toward horizon. Water surface appears completely flat and smooth like glass, reflecting vibrant pink, orange, and blue cloudy sky. Sky displays mixture of dark storm clouds and bright areas near horizon where sun creates golden-peach glow. Perfectly level horizon line where water meets sky. Quote overlay in white text: '"The fact that water is flat like a sheet of paper (when undisturbed by wind and tide) is my 'working anchor,' and the powerful 'ground tackle' of all those who reject the delusions of modern theoretical astronomy. Prove water to be convex, and we will at once and forever retant and grant you anything you like to demand."' Attribution: '-Thomas Winship'. Quote challenges spherical Earth model by asserting water's observable flatness when calm contradicts curved surface required by globe model. Demands proof of water convexity as prerequisite for accepting heliocentric astronomy0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-4","title":"Water Level 4","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14906983_1473512396010956_8187552407344125710_n.jpeg","description":"Bruce Lee meme with black background featuring martial artist in iconic fighting stance with intense expression, shirtless showing muscular physique, hands extended in defensive/attack position.

References Bruce Lee's famous philosophy 'Be like water' and his iconic vocal expression during martial arts demonstrations. Meme uses water as simplest proof of flat Earth: water naturally seeks and maintains level surface due to gravity, always finding lowest point and creating flat, horizontal surface when undisturbed. Argues this observable property of water (always level, never curved) proves Earth must be flat plane rather than sphere. Combines Bruce Lee's water philosophy with flat Earth argument that water's tendency to be level contradicts curved ocean surfaces required by spherical Earth model.

Shows pristine white sandy beach in foreground with single coconut palm tree leaning at angle over turquoise-blue ocean water. Palm fronds extend gracefully toward right side. Ocean displays gradient from light turquoise near shore to deeper blue at horizon. Clear bright blue sky with white puffy clouds scattered across upper portion. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across entire width of image. Sandy beach shows footprints and natural beach debris. Bottom watermark 'FlatEarth101.com' in green text.
