5:T2669,Ancient Babylonian clay tablet world map from 6th century BCE cited as evidence ancients knew Earth was flat. Photograph of genuine archaeological artifact - the Babylonian Map of the World (Imago Mundi) - oldest known world map dating to approximately 600-500 BCE. Flat Earth community presents this ancient map as proof that pre-scientific civilizations correctly understood Earth's flat shape before modern "globe Earth deception" began. Image shows cuneiform clay tablet photographed against neutral gray background typical of museum photography. Tablet appears light tan/beige colored clay material common to Mesopotamian artifacts. Surface shows weathering, cracks, and damage consistent with 2,600+ year old artifact. Tablet is fragmentary - broken edges visible around perimeter showing original tablet was larger, portions missing/damaged over millennia. Overall shape is irregular due to breakage but roughly rectangular orientation. Upper portion of tablet contains multiple lines of CUNEIFORM SCRIPT - wedge-shaped impressions pressed into wet clay before firing, characteristic of Mesopotamian writing system used from approximately 3400 BCE to 100 CE. Cuneiform text appears as rows of angular marks arranged in horizontal lines. Text appears worn but legible to trained scholars. This portion contains written descriptions and cosmological explanations accompanying the map below. Small numbers visible near top including "82" and what appears to be museum catalog number "92687" identifying this specific artifact in British Museum collection where tablet is housed. Center-lower portion contains the MAP ITSELF - circular diagram representing Babylonian understanding of world geography. Map shows: CENTRAL CIRCLE representing known world (Babylonian empire and surrounding regions). Within circle are rectangular shapes representing cities/regions, with Babylon prominently positioned near center as most important location in Babylonian worldview. Euphrates River depicted as vertical line running through center of circular world - essential waterway for Mesopotamian civilization. Surrounding the circular "known world" is RING representing cosmic ocean (marratu/bitter river) - ancient Near Eastern concept of waters surrounding inhabited lands. Beyond the ocean ring are TRIANGULAR PROJECTIONS extending outward - these represent distant, mythological regions beyond the known world, described in accompanying text as places of strange creatures, eternal darkness, or divine realms. Triangles give map distinctive star-like appearance when viewed from above. Map orientation and symbols reflect Babylonian cosmological beliefs rather than geographic accuracy. Text overlays on image: Upper left shows white text reading "The oldest known world map from 6th century Babylon portraying the earth as flat." in serif font. Text presents flat Earth interpretation of artifact. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: Ancient civilizations depicted Earth as flat disc because that's what they observed and correctly understood before modern scientists invented globe Earth lie. Babylonians were intelligent civilization with astronomy, mathematics, writing - their flat Earth map reflects genuine knowledge, not primitive ignorance. If Earth were really spherical, ancient astronomers would have discovered this. Persistence of flat Earth models across cultures (Babylonian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, Norse, Chinese, etc.) demonstrates universal human recognition of flat Earth reality before 15th-16th century European "discoveries" imposed globe model. HISTORICAL CONTEXT - The Artifact: Tablet discovered in Sippar (ancient Babylonian city) in 19th century, now housed in British Museum (catalog number BM 92687). Created during Neo-Babylonian period (626-539 BCE). One of most significant cartographic artifacts from ancient world. Represents Mesopotamian cosmological worldview combining geographic knowledge with mythological beliefs. Map is NOT attempt at accurate world geography but rather cosmological diagram showing relationship between known world, cosmic ocean, and mythological periphery. WHAT MAP ACTUALLY SHOWS: 1) GEOCENTRIC COSMOLOGY: Babylon at center reflects political/cultural importance, not geographic accuracy. Ancient maps often placed mapmaker's civilization at center (like medieval European maps centering Jerusalem). 2) SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY: Shapes represent concepts (cities, rivers, regions) rather than accurate outlines. Not intended as navigation tool but as cosmological/religious document explaining world order. 3) LIMITED KNOWLEDGE: Map shows only regions known to Babylonians through trade, warfare, diplomacy. Areas beyond direct knowledge depicted as mythological zones. 4) FLAT DISC REPRESENTATION: Yes, map depicts world as flat disc - but this reflects limitations of Babylonian astronomy and geography, NOT accurate Earth observation. Babylonians lacked technology (ocean-going ships, high-altitude observation, telescopes) to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model was reasonable hypothesis given available evidence, but was incorrect. WHY ANCIENTS BELIEVED FLAT EARTH: Human perception at ground level shows apparently flat horizon extending in all directions. Without technology to travel great distances, achieve high altitudes, or make precise astronomical measurements, flat Earth is intuitive default assumption. Ancient civilizations made this assumption because they lacked evidence otherwise - not because they had superior knowledge later suppressed. As Greek astronomy developed (6th-3rd century BCE), evidence accumulated for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, travelers reporting sun angle changes with latitude. By 3rd century BCE, educated Greeks knew Earth was spherical and Eratosthenes calculated its circumference with remarkable accuracy. Babylonians predated these Greek discoveries. PROBLEMS WITH FLAT EARTH INTERPRETATION: 1) APPEAL TO ANTIQUITY FALLACY: Age doesn't equal accuracy. Ancient civilizations believed many things we now know are incorrect (geocentrism, four elements, miasma disease theory, etc.). Being old doesn't make a belief correct. 2) CHERRY-PICKING: Flat Earthers cite Babylonian flat Earth map while ignoring later Greek discoveries of spherical Earth (same ancient world, just slightly later). Ancient Greeks (Pythagoras, Aristotle, Eratosthenes) knew Earth was spherical centuries before Common Era. Why accept Babylonian flat model but reject Greek spherical model from same era? 3) COSMOLOGICAL VS GEOGRAPHIC: Babylonian map is cosmological diagram, not geographic map. It depicts world as Babylonians conceptualized it religiously/philosophically, not as they measured it scientifically. Using it as evidence for Earth's actual shape misunderstands its purpose. 4) TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS: Babylonians lacked technology to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model reflects observational limitations, not superior knowledge. As technology improved (ocean navigation, high-altitude flight, satellite imagery), spherical Earth became undeniable. 5) SUBSEQUENT VERIFICATION: Every technological advance since ancient times has confirmed spherical Earth - global circumnavigation, aerial photography, satellite imagery, GPS, international space programs. If ancient flat Earth model were correct, these technologies would have revealed it. Instead, all confirm sphere. IRONY: Image presents Babylonian map as evidence for flat Earth, but: Archaeological study of this exact tablet has been conducted by spherical Earth-accepting scholars who understand it as cosmological document reflecting ancient worldview limitations. British Museum where tablet resides operates on assumption of spherical Earth (shipping artifacts internationally requires spherical Earth navigation). Academic consensus studying ancient Near Eastern cosmology understands these maps as historical artifacts showing how ancient peoples conceptualized their world with limited information, not as accurate geographic representations. Tablet is evidence of how humans understood world before developing technology to observe it accurately - exactly the kind of artifact that demonstrates why scientific progress matters. Babylonians did their best with available information; we now have better information confirming spherical Earth. VISUAL ANALYSIS: Tablet's fragmentary condition adds authenticity - clearly ancient artifact, not modern fabrication. Museum-quality photography suggests legitimate archaeological documentation. Cuneiform script readable by scholars confirms Babylonian origin and content. Map's distinctive circular design with triangular projections is recognizable to anyone familiar with ancient Near Eastern cartography. Image effectively uses genuine historical artifact to support flat Earth narrative by presenting ancient belief as validation of modern conspiracy theory. But closer examination reveals artifact supports opposite conclusion: ancient peoples believed flat Earth due to observational limitations; modern technology has proven them incorrect. Citing their beliefs as evidence is argument from ignorance, not argument from knowledge. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) indicates this archaeological photograph repurposed for conspiracy theory promotion. Original artifact is genuine; interpretation imposed upon it is misleading. Effectiveness comes from: Visual authority of authentic ancient artifact, appeal to antiquity (old = true), implication that modern science suppresses ancient wisdom. But archaeological and historical context demonstrates artifact reflects ancient limitations, not ancient truths about Earth's shape.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 377 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Ancient Babylonian clay tablet world map from 6th century BCE cited as evidence ancients knew Earth was flat.
