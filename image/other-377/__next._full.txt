13:T2669,Ancient Babylonian clay tablet world map from 6th century BCE cited as evidence ancients knew Earth was flat. Photograph of genuine archaeological artifact - the Babylonian Map of the World (Imago Mundi) - oldest known world map dating to approximately 600-500 BCE. Flat Earth community presents this ancient map as proof that pre-scientific civilizations correctly understood Earth's flat shape before modern "globe Earth deception" began. Image shows cuneiform clay tablet photographed against neutral gray background typical of museum photography. Tablet appears light tan/beige colored clay material common to Mesopotamian artifacts. Surface shows weathering, cracks, and damage consistent with 2,600+ year old artifact. Tablet is fragmentary - broken edges visible around perimeter showing original tablet was larger, portions missing/damaged over millennia. Overall shape is irregular due to breakage but roughly rectangular orientation. Upper portion of tablet contains multiple lines of CUNEIFORM SCRIPT - wedge-shaped impressions pressed into wet clay before firing, characteristic of Mesopotamian writing system used from approximately 3400 BCE to 100 CE. Cuneiform text appears as rows of angular marks arranged in horizontal lines. Text appears worn but legible to trained scholars. This portion contains written descriptions and cosmological explanations accompanying the map below. Small numbers visible near top including "82" and what appears to be museum catalog number "92687" identifying this specific artifact in British Museum collection where tablet is housed. Center-lower portion contains the MAP ITSELF - circular diagram representing Babylonian understanding of world geography. Map shows: CENTRAL CIRCLE representing known world (Babylonian empire and surrounding regions). Within circle are rectangular shapes representing cities/regions, with Babylon prominently positioned near center as most important location in Babylonian worldview. Euphrates River depicted as vertical line running through center of circular world - essential waterway for Mesopotamian civilization. Surrounding the circular "known world" is RING representing cosmic ocean (marratu/bitter river) - ancient Near Eastern concept of waters surrounding inhabited lands. Beyond the ocean ring are TRIANGULAR PROJECTIONS extending outward - these represent distant, mythological regions beyond the known world, described in accompanying text as places of strange creatures, eternal darkness, or divine realms. Triangles give map distinctive star-like appearance when viewed from above. Map orientation and symbols reflect Babylonian cosmological beliefs rather than geographic accuracy. Text overlays on image: Upper left shows white text reading "The oldest known world map from 6th century Babylon portraying the earth as flat." in serif font. Text presents flat Earth interpretation of artifact. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: Ancient civilizations depicted Earth as flat disc because that's what they observed and correctly understood before modern scientists invented globe Earth lie. Babylonians were intelligent civilization with astronomy, mathematics, writing - their flat Earth map reflects genuine knowledge, not primitive ignorance. If Earth were really spherical, ancient astronomers would have discovered this. Persistence of flat Earth models across cultures (Babylonian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, Norse, Chinese, etc.) demonstrates universal human recognition of flat Earth reality before 15th-16th century European "discoveries" imposed globe model. HISTORICAL CONTEXT - The Artifact: Tablet discovered in Sippar (ancient Babylonian city) in 19th century, now housed in British Museum (catalog number BM 92687). Created during Neo-Babylonian period (626-539 BCE). One of most significant cartographic artifacts from ancient world. Represents Mesopotamian cosmological worldview combining geographic knowledge with mythological beliefs. Map is NOT attempt at accurate world geography but rather cosmological diagram showing relationship between known world, cosmic ocean, and mythological periphery. WHAT MAP ACTUALLY SHOWS: 1) GEOCENTRIC COSMOLOGY: Babylon at center reflects political/cultural importance, not geographic accuracy. Ancient maps often placed mapmaker's civilization at center (like medieval European maps centering Jerusalem). 2) SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY: Shapes represent concepts (cities, rivers, regions) rather than accurate outlines. Not intended as navigation tool but as cosmological/religious document explaining world order. 3) LIMITED KNOWLEDGE: Map shows only regions known to Babylonians through trade, warfare, diplomacy. Areas beyond direct knowledge depicted as mythological zones. 4) FLAT DISC REPRESENTATION: Yes, map depicts world as flat disc - but this reflects limitations of Babylonian astronomy and geography, NOT accurate Earth observation. Babylonians lacked technology (ocean-going ships, high-altitude observation, telescopes) to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model was reasonable hypothesis given available evidence, but was incorrect. WHY ANCIENTS BELIEVED FLAT EARTH: Human perception at ground level shows apparently flat horizon extending in all directions. Without technology to travel great distances, achieve high altitudes, or make precise astronomical measurements, flat Earth is intuitive default assumption. Ancient civilizations made this assumption because they lacked evidence otherwise - not because they had superior knowledge later suppressed. As Greek astronomy developed (6th-3rd century BCE), evidence accumulated for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, travelers reporting sun angle changes with latitude. By 3rd century BCE, educated Greeks knew Earth was spherical and Eratosthenes calculated its circumference with remarkable accuracy. Babylonians predated these Greek discoveries. PROBLEMS WITH FLAT EARTH INTERPRETATION: 1) APPEAL TO ANTIQUITY FALLACY: Age doesn't equal accuracy. Ancient civilizations believed many things we now know are incorrect (geocentrism, four elements, miasma disease theory, etc.). Being old doesn't make a belief correct. 2) CHERRY-PICKING: Flat Earthers cite Babylonian flat Earth map while ignoring later Greek discoveries of spherical Earth (same ancient world, just slightly later). Ancient Greeks (Pythagoras, Aristotle, Eratosthenes) knew Earth was spherical centuries before Common Era. Why accept Babylonian flat model but reject Greek spherical model from same era? 3) COSMOLOGICAL VS GEOGRAPHIC: Babylonian map is cosmological diagram, not geographic map. It depicts world as Babylonians conceptualized it religiously/philosophically, not as they measured it scientifically. Using it as evidence for Earth's actual shape misunderstands its purpose. 4) TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS: Babylonians lacked technology to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model reflects observational limitations, not superior knowledge. As technology improved (ocean navigation, high-altitude flight, satellite imagery), spherical Earth became undeniable. 5) SUBSEQUENT VERIFICATION: Every technological advance since ancient times has confirmed spherical Earth - global circumnavigation, aerial photography, satellite imagery, GPS, international space programs. If ancient flat Earth model were correct, these technologies would have revealed it. Instead, all confirm sphere. IRONY: Image presents Babylonian map as evidence for flat Earth, but: Archaeological study of this exact tablet has been conducted by spherical Earth-accepting scholars who understand it as cosmological document reflecting ancient worldview limitations. British Museum where tablet resides operates on assumption of spherical Earth (shipping artifacts internationally requires spherical Earth navigation). Academic consensus studying ancient Near Eastern cosmology understands these maps as historical artifacts showing how ancient peoples conceptualized their world with limited information, not as accurate geographic representations. Tablet is evidence of how humans understood world before developing technology to observe it accurately - exactly the kind of artifact that demonstrates why scientific progress matters. Babylonians did their best with available information; we now have better information confirming spherical Earth. VISUAL ANALYSIS: Tablet's fragmentary condition adds authenticity - clearly ancient artifact, not modern fabrication. Museum-quality photography suggests legitimate archaeological documentation. Cuneiform script readable by scholars confirms Babylonian origin and content. Map's distinctive circular design with triangular projections is recognizable to anyone familiar with ancient Near Eastern cartography. Image effectively uses genuine historical artifact to support flat Earth narrative by presenting ancient belief as validation of modern conspiracy theory. But closer examination reveals artifact supports opposite conclusion: ancient peoples believed flat Earth due to observational limitations; modern technology has proven them incorrect. Citing their beliefs as evidence is argument from ignorance, not argument from knowledge. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) indicates this archaeological photograph repurposed for conspiracy theory promotion. Original artifact is genuine; interpretation imposed upon it is misleading. Effectiveness comes from: Visual authority of authentic ancient artifact, appeal to antiquity (old = true), implication that modern science suppresses ancient wisdom. But archaeological and historical context demonstrates artifact reflects ancient limitations, not ancient truths about Earth's shape.14:T2ee9,"Lost their marbles" insult meme suggesting flat Earthers insane for denying spherical Earth. Humorous visual pun using literal marble representing Earth to mock flat Earth beliefs through idiomatic expression about mental illness. Common insult format combining idiom with physical representation for comedic effect and dismissive ridicule. Image shows close-up photograph of human hand holding decorative glass marble. Background is out of focus - appears light peach/orange tones suggesting skin (perhaps arm or body part) creating clean background isolating marble as focal point. Lighting appears natural or soft artificial creating warm tones. Hand enters frame from bottom showing THUMB and FINGERS pinching marble in typical holding position. Fingers show natural skin tone (appears light-skinned hand) with visible skin texture, minor creases, fingernails. Thumb positioned on left side, index finger on right side, gripping marble between tips showing delicate hold of small object. Hand slightly out of focus emphasizing marble as sharp focal point - classic macro photography technique isolating subject. Marble itself is GLOBE-STYLE decorative glass marble showing Earth's geography. Marble appears standard size (approximately 1-1.5 inch diameter) typical of toy marbles or decorative collectibles. Made of clear glass with internal image/coloring creating Earth appearance. INTERIOR DESIGN shows: Primary color is deep BLUE representing oceans covering majority of visible hemisphere. Blue appears cobalt or azure shade typical of how Earth looks from space - rich blue color. WHITE wispy streaks across blue representing CLOUDS - irregular flowing patterns scattered across surface creating realistic atmospheric appearance. Brown, tan, and green irregular shapes representing CONTINENTS - landmasses visible on sphere's surface showing geographic features. Visible regions appear to show EUROPE and AFRICA based on shapes - Mediterranean region, African continent outline recognizable. Map projection shows one hemisphere of Earth as visible from space. Green areas suggest vegetated regions (forests, grasslands), brown/tan suggests deserts or arid areas (Sahara visible as tan region). Red/pink tinges visible in some continental areas possibly representing elevation, climate zones, or artistic coloring choice. Overall effect creates miniature Earth appearance - "blue marble" visualization shrunk to toy size. Glass is transparent allowing light to pass through creating slight glow effect - marble appears to glow from within due to translucent glass quality. Surface shows slight reflection/glare from lighting creating bright spot on sphere's surface typical of spherical reflective objects. Curvature of glass creates lens effect slightly distorting internal image at edges. Internal continents appear to have slight depth - image may be embedded in glass layers rather than surface-printed, creating three-dimensional quality. Manufacturing technique likely involves: base blue glass, printed or painted continents/features, clear glass overlay, heating/fusing into solid sphere. Result is durable decorative marble sold as toy, collectible, or desk ornament. TEXT OVERLAYS span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for maximum contrast and readability against varied background colors. Top text reads: "FLAT EARTHERS HAVEN'T LOST ALL THEIR MARBLES..." in all-caps white letters. Ellipsis at end creates pause suggesting continuation coming. Bottom text completes thought: "JUST THIS BLUE ONE" in matching all-caps white letters. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION: "Lost their marbles" is English idiom meaning to become insane, crazy, irrational, or mentally unstable. Origins uncertain but dates to early 1900s. Possible derivations: 1) Marbles as metaphor for mental faculties - losing marbles = losing mental capabilities. 2) Reference to marble game where losing all marbles means game over. 3) Marbles as slang for testicles or head (both round), losing them = losing capability or sense. Used colloquially to describe someone acting irrationally, making nonsensical arguments, or holding obviously false beliefs. "He's lost his marbles" = he's gone crazy. Mild insult suggesting mental incompetence rather than serious psychological diagnosis. MEME'S WORDPLAY: 1) LITERALIZES METAPHOR: Instead of abstract "losing marbles" (losing sanity), shows actual physical marble being lost. Visual pun combines literal object with figurative expression creating humor through unexpected connection. 2) "BLUE ONE" SPECIFICATION: Narrows "all their marbles" to specific "blue one" - the Earth marble. Suggests flat Earthers are mostly sane EXCEPT regarding Earth's shape. Lost only one specific marble (the blue planet marble) while retaining other marbles (other aspects of rationality). Acknowledges they may function normally in most areas but have specific delusion about Earth's shape. 3) "BLUE MARBLE" REFERENCE: "Blue Marble" is famous photograph of Earth taken by Apollo 17 crew in 1972 showing fully illuminated Earth as blue sphere with clouds and continents. Became iconic image of Earth from space, frequently called "Blue Marble" due to appearance. NASA website features "Blue Marble" image collections. Phrase "blue marble" synonymous with Earth viewed from space. Meme's "blue one" specifically references this - flat Earthers lost the blue marble (spherical Earth reality). 4) VISUAL PROOF: Marble SHOWING SPHERICAL EARTH with continents creates visual argument that Earth IS a sphere/ball/marble. Holding miniature globe emphasizes round shape. Image contradicts flat Earth while being object flat Earthers supposedly "lost" - they lost sight of spherical Earth truth. Globe in hand becomes evidence they reject. MEME'S ARGUMENT: Flat Earthers are mentally deficient (lost marbles = insanity) specifically regarding Earth's shape. They deny obvious reality (spherical Earth) visible in images from space, provable by physics, confirmable by anyone. Rejecting overwhelming evidence for flat Earth belief indicates mental problem - loss of specific rationality marble regarding planetary geometry. Not completely insane (haven't lost ALL marbles) but specifically delusional about Earth (lost the blue marble). INSULTING TONE: Meme is pure insult with no educational content. Doesn't explain why Earth is spherical or address flat Earth arguments - simply mocks believers as crazy. Serves tribal function for spherical Earth believers - sharing meme signals "I'm not one of those crazy flat Earthers." Provides emotional satisfaction through ridicule without engagement. EFFECTIVENESS: Visual pun is memorable and clever. Wordplay works on multiple levels (idiom, literal marble, Blue Marble photo reference, visual demonstration of sphere). Image is simple, clear, requires minimal explanation. Insult is delivered through humor rather than anger, making it more shareable. Works as dismissive response - when flat Earther makes argument, respond with this meme rather than debating. WEAKNESS: Persuades nobody. Flat Earthers seeing this would dismiss it as ad hominem attack (attacking person rather than argument). Insults rarely change minds - usually strengthen opposition through backfire effect. Preaching to choir - only satisfies those who already accept spherical Earth. Creates hostile environment discouraging constructive dialogue. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT: Calling someone "crazy" or suggesting mental illness over scientific disagreement is problematic: Conflates genuine mental illness with simply being wrong about facts. Mental illness is medical condition requiring compassion, not insult. Being factually wrong (even stubbornly wrong) isn't mental illness - it's human error, ignorance, motivated reasoning, or cognitive bias. Flat Earth belief stems from: distrust of authorities, misunderstanding of scale/physics, confirmation bias, social belonging in conspiracy community, religious interpretations, exposure to misleading content. None of these are mental illness. Throwing around "crazy/insane" as insult for incorrect beliefs stigmatizes actual mental illness and prevents productive discussion. MARBLE CHOICE: Glass globe marble is perfect visual metaphor because: Literally shows Earth as sphere with continents/oceans (accurate representation). Small enough to hold in hand (like flat Earthers could "hold onto" truth about spherical Earth but dropped it). Toy object suggesting childishness of flat Earth belief (playing with toys = immature). Fragile glass marble can be lost or broken (fragile grasp on reality). Common childhood toy invoking nostalgia while insulting. COMPOSITIONAL ELEMENTS: Soft focus background eliminates distractions keeping attention on marble. Warm skin tones create human connection - hand holding truth. Clear focus on marble emphasizes detail of continents/oceans proving sphericity. Light glow through transparent glass creates almost magical quality - truth illuminated. Hand's gentle grip suggests precious object being carefully held - truth is valuable but flat Earthers let it slip away. SPHERICAL EARTH IN MINIATURE: Marble demonstrates exactly what flat Earthers deny - Earth is sphere. Continents arranged on curved surface, no edge visible, opposite side hidden by curvature. If Earth were flat, marble would be disc showing all geography at once with visible edge. Sphere hides antipodes (regions on opposite side), shows curvature at horizon, displays geography as distributed across three-dimensional surface. Marble is scale model of actual Earth geometry. Flat Earthers would need flat disc marble to match their model, but such marbles don't exist because Earth isn't flat. ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS: Meme could be read as: 1) Flat Earthers physically lost a marble (minor loss, not complete insanity). 2) Flat Earthers reject the blue marble (Earth) as real, dismissing space photos as fake. 3) Flat Earthers need to find this marble (discover truth about spherical Earth). 4) Everyone else has blue marble (accepts spherical Earth), flat Earthers lost theirs (left behind rational majority). All interpretations support same message: flat Earth belief is irrational, mentally deficient, contrary to evidence (symbolized by literal spherical Earth marble). ORIGIN: Likely created by globe Earth believer frustrated with flat Earth arguments. Purpose is venting frustration through humor rather than education. Shared within anti-flat Earth communities as bonding mechanism - "we're sane ones, they're crazy ones." Perpetuates tribal division rather than building understanding. FORMAT: Classic impact meme format - single image with text top and bottom. Easy to share, requires no explanation, delivers joke quickly. Phrase structure builds anticipation ("haven't lost all marbles...") then delivers punchline ("just this blue one"). Visual supports joke perfectly - wouldn't work without actual blue Earth marble image. SIMILAR MEMES: Other "lost marbles" variations exist for different topics: anti-vaxxers lost health marble, conspiracy theorists lost specific topic marbles, etc. Format is reusable template for mocking any group considered irrational. Flat Earth version particularly effective because literal blue marble exists matching metaphor perfectly. This coincidence (Earth called "blue marble" + "lost marbles" idiom = visual pun opportunity) makes meme especially memorable. RECEPTION: Globe Earth believers find it funny, clever, satisfying. Flat Earth believers find it insulting, dismissive, evidence of establishment mockery. Neither group likely changes opinion from seeing this - confirms existing beliefs for both sides. In spherical Earth vs flat Earth culture war, meme is weapon rather than bridge. Ultimately: clever insult with excellent visual metaphor, but zero educational or persuasive value. Exists to mock rather than inform, divide rather than unite, satisfy in-group rather than convince out-group.15:T21b6,Aerial view of Mount Fuji from airplane mocking "not high enough to see curvature" argument with flat horizon visible. Stunning high-altitude photograph of snow-capped volcano rising above cloud layer, presented sarcastically to mock claims that commercial airplane altitude is insufficient to observe Earth's curvature. Image demonstrates flat Earth argument that horizon appears flat even at cruising altitude, challenging globe Earth model. Photograph taken from commercial aircraft window showing spectacular aerial view. Image quality suggests smartphone or consumer camera capturing moment during flight. Slight vignetting and color cast around edges typical of photos taken through airplane windows (multiple glass/plastic layers, scratches, reflections affect image quality). CENTRAL SUBJECT: Mount Fuji (Fujisan) - Japan's highest peak at 3,776 meters (12,389 feet), iconic stratovolcano located on Honshu island. Instantly recognizable symmetrical conical shape formed by volcanic activity over thousands of years. Mountain dominates center-lower portion of frame rising dramatically above surrounding landscape. SNOW CAP: Summit covered in brilliant white snow creating sharp contrast against darker volcanic rock below snow line. Snow appears bright, reflective in sunlight suggesting clear weather conditions. Classic Fuji silhouette - steep sides rising to pointed peak with distinctive snow coverage that makes mountain famous worldwide. SURROUNDING CLOUDS: Mid-altitude clouds form layer between airplane and ground. Clouds appear white, fluffy, cumulus-type formations scattered across visible area. Mount Fuji's peak rises ABOVE cloud layer - volcano is tall enough to penetrate through clouds, summit clearly visible while lower slopes partially obscured. This dramatic effect (mountain piercing cloud layer) creates iconic imagery frequently photographed from aircraft. ATMOSPHERE AND SKY: Upper portion shows gradient from deep blue at top (direction away from Earth) to lighter blue/cyan at horizon where atmosphere is thicker. Gradient is natural atmospheric effect caused by Rayleigh scattering - shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more, creating blue sky that fades toward white at horizon where light passes through more atmosphere. Transition zone between sky and horizon shows atmospheric haze - common at high altitude where distant views reveal Earth's atmosphere as visible layer. HORIZON: Critical element for flat Earth argument - horizon line appears essentially STRAIGHT/FLAT across entire width of image. No obvious curvature visible despite altitude of commercial aircraft (typically 30,000-40,000 feet / 9,000-12,000 meters). Flat Earth proponents argue: If Earth were spherical, curvature should be visible at this altitude. Horizon appearing flat "proves" Earth is flat plane, not sphere. TEXT OVERLAYS: Top text in black font reads: "y'all be like... 'you're not high enough to see the curve...keep going'" - Sarcastic quotation mocking globe Earth defenders who claim higher altitude is needed to see curvature. "Y'all be like" is internet slang format for mocking opposing viewpoints by paraphrasing them dismissively. Bottom right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Bottom left shows timestamp "2016-01-24, 8:19 PM" indicating when image was posted/shared. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: Globe Earth believers keep moving goalposts - first they say curvature visible from tall buildings (it isn't), then from airplanes (it isn't), then from higher altitude (keep going). Image shows airplane-altitude view with flat horizon, challenging claim that commercial flight altitude reveals curvature. If Earth were 25,000 mile circumference sphere, shouldn't curvature be visible by now? Each time flat Earther points out flat horizon at given altitude, globe believers say "go higher" - convenient excuse that can continue indefinitely until reaching space (which flat Earthers believe is fake anyway). SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE - Why curvature isn't visible here: 1) ALTITUDE VS CURVATURE RATIO: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles (6,371 km). Commercial aircraft cruise at ~7 miles (35,000 feet) altitude. This is 0.18% of Earth's radius - extremely small percentage. Curvature visible at this ratio is minimal - approximately 3 degrees of arc across 60-degree field of view. Human eye struggles to detect such subtle curve against natural horizon irregularities. 2) FIELD OF VIEW LIMITATION: To see obvious curvature, need wide field of view capturing significant portion of Earth's circumference. Airplane window provides narrow field of view - maybe 60-90 degrees. At 35,000 feet, visible horizon is approximately 230 miles away. Earth's circumference is 25,000 miles, so visible horizon represents less than 1% of circumference. Expecting dramatic curve from <1% sample is unrealistic. 3) ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS: Atmospheric refraction bends light, affecting horizon appearance. Haze, clouds, and atmospheric layers create visual effects that can mask or enhance apparent curvature. Clear conditions needed for accurate curvature observation. 4) CAMERA/WINDOW DISTORTION: Airplane windows are curved (for structural strength) and multi-layered. This can introduce optical distortion affecting straight lines. Consumer cameras also have lens distortion. These effects can flatten or curve horizon depending on window/lens combination. 5) ACTUALLY VISIBLE WITH PROPER CONDITIONS: At 35,000 feet with wide-angle view and clear conditions, subtle curvature IS detectable, but requires careful observation. Amateur high-altitude balloon experiments (100,000+ feet) clearly show curvature. Felix Baumgartner's 2012 space dive (128,000 feet) showed obvious curved horizon. ISS astronauts at 250+ miles altitude see dramatic curvature - entire Earth limb visible. MOUNT FUJI CONTEXT: Mountain's presence in frame actually helps demonstrate spherical Earth: Fuji visible from distance despite being "below" airplane altitude would be impossible on infinite flat plane (should be visible infinitely far away). Atmospheric haze limiting visibility consistent with spherical Earth where atmosphere curves away. Mountain appearing to "rise" from clouds demonstrates perspective consistent with spherical surface. PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS: Beautiful photograph regardless of intended message. Mount Fuji is World Heritage Site, culturally significant to Japan, frequently photographed from aircraft. This particular image captures classic view - snow-capped peak above clouds, clear sky, dramatic lighting. Photographer clearly captured special moment, even if captioning to support flat Earth belief. Image metadata suggests photo taken January 24, 2016 at 8:19 PM (likely Japan time, or time zone where poster located). Winter timing explains heavy snow coverage on Fuji. Flight likely trans-Pacific route or domestic Japanese flight passing near Fuji. MEME FORMAT ANALYSIS: "Y'all be like..." format is dismissive mocking structure. Puts words in opponent's mouth, then presents image as refutation. Implies globe Earth believers are desperate, constantly making excuses, never satisfied. Sarcasm ("keep going") suggests goalposts perpetually moving. Format effective for in-group humor but unconvincing to those who understand science of curvature visibility. ACTUAL CURVATURE VISIBILITY: Commercial airline passengers occasionally DO see subtle curvature under right conditions (very clear day, wide window view, careful observation). But it's subtle and easy to miss. Dramatic curvature visible at: ~60,000 feet (noticeable), ~100,000 feet (obvious), ~250+ miles (dramatic, whole Earth limb visible). This doesn't mean Earth is flat at lower altitudes - just means our vantage point is insufficient to easily detect curve at normal flight altitude. Like standing on basketball surface - curve exists but too gradual to see from close range. Zoom out (go higher) and curve becomes apparent. BOTTOM LINE: Image shows beautiful aerial photography but misunderstands relationship between altitude, field of view, and curvature detection. Horizon appearing flat from 35,000 feet is expected on spherical Earth - curvature at this altitude is approximately 0.04% deviation from straight line across typical field of view. Detecting such subtle curve requires precise instruments or much higher altitude. Image inadvertently demonstrates how normal observations at human scales fail to reveal planetary-scale geometry, explaining why ancient peoples (lacking high-altitude capability) assumed flat Earth. Technology allowing higher altitude observation consistently reveals curvature, confirming spherical model.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-377","title":"Other 377","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12898330_484081201791619_1202131697620267878_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-376","title":"Other 376","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12898186_485588638307542_4839887097153488830_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-378","title":"Other 378","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12901197_484656388400767_3596226479629961451_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

16:T2669,Ancient Babylonian clay tablet world map from 6th century BCE cited as evidence ancients knew Earth was flat. Photograph of genuine archaeological artifact - the Babylonian Map of the World (Imago Mundi) - oldest known world map dating to approximately 600-500 BCE. Flat Earth community presents this ancient map as proof that pre-scientific civilizations correctly understood Earth's flat shape before modern "globe Earth deception" began. Image shows cuneiform clay tablet photographed against neutral gray background typical of museum photography. Tablet appears light tan/beige colored clay material common to Mesopotamian artifacts. Surface shows weathering, cracks, and damage consistent with 2,600+ year old artifact. Tablet is fragmentary - broken edges visible around perimeter showing original tablet was larger, portions missing/damaged over millennia. Overall shape is irregular due to breakage but roughly rectangular orientation. Upper portion of tablet contains multiple lines of CUNEIFORM SCRIPT - wedge-shaped impressions pressed into wet clay before firing, characteristic of Mesopotamian writing system used from approximately 3400 BCE to 100 CE. Cuneiform text appears as rows of angular marks arranged in horizontal lines. Text appears worn but legible to trained scholars. This portion contains written descriptions and cosmological explanations accompanying the map below. Small numbers visible near top including "82" and what appears to be museum catalog number "92687" identifying this specific artifact in British Museum collection where tablet is housed. Center-lower portion contains the MAP ITSELF - circular diagram representing Babylonian understanding of world geography. Map shows: CENTRAL CIRCLE representing known world (Babylonian empire and surrounding regions). Within circle are rectangular shapes representing cities/regions, with Babylon prominently positioned near center as most important location in Babylonian worldview. Euphrates River depicted as vertical line running through center of circular world - essential waterway for Mesopotamian civilization. Surrounding the circular "known world" is RING representing cosmic ocean (marratu/bitter river) - ancient Near Eastern concept of waters surrounding inhabited lands. Beyond the ocean ring are TRIANGULAR PROJECTIONS extending outward - these represent distant, mythological regions beyond the known world, described in accompanying text as places of strange creatures, eternal darkness, or divine realms. Triangles give map distinctive star-like appearance when viewed from above. Map orientation and symbols reflect Babylonian cosmological beliefs rather than geographic accuracy. Text overlays on image: Upper left shows white text reading "The oldest known world map from 6th century Babylon portraying the earth as flat." in serif font. Text presents flat Earth interpretation of artifact. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: Ancient civilizations depicted Earth as flat disc because that's what they observed and correctly understood before modern scientists invented globe Earth lie. Babylonians were intelligent civilization with astronomy, mathematics, writing - their flat Earth map reflects genuine knowledge, not primitive ignorance. If Earth were really spherical, ancient astronomers would have discovered this. Persistence of flat Earth models across cultures (Babylonian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, Norse, Chinese, etc.) demonstrates universal human recognition of flat Earth reality before 15th-16th century European "discoveries" imposed globe model. HISTORICAL CONTEXT - The Artifact: Tablet discovered in Sippar (ancient Babylonian city) in 19th century, now housed in British Museum (catalog number BM 92687). Created during Neo-Babylonian period (626-539 BCE). One of most significant cartographic artifacts from ancient world. Represents Mesopotamian cosmological worldview combining geographic knowledge with mythological beliefs. Map is NOT attempt at accurate world geography but rather cosmological diagram showing relationship between known world, cosmic ocean, and mythological periphery. WHAT MAP ACTUALLY SHOWS: 1) GEOCENTRIC COSMOLOGY: Babylon at center reflects political/cultural importance, not geographic accuracy. Ancient maps often placed mapmaker's civilization at center (like medieval European maps centering Jerusalem). 2) SYMBOLIC GEOGRAPHY: Shapes represent concepts (cities, rivers, regions) rather than accurate outlines. Not intended as navigation tool but as cosmological/religious document explaining world order. 3) LIMITED KNOWLEDGE: Map shows only regions known to Babylonians through trade, warfare, diplomacy. Areas beyond direct knowledge depicted as mythological zones. 4) FLAT DISC REPRESENTATION: Yes, map depicts world as flat disc - but this reflects limitations of Babylonian astronomy and geography, NOT accurate Earth observation. Babylonians lacked technology (ocean-going ships, high-altitude observation, telescopes) to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model was reasonable hypothesis given available evidence, but was incorrect. WHY ANCIENTS BELIEVED FLAT EARTH: Human perception at ground level shows apparently flat horizon extending in all directions. Without technology to travel great distances, achieve high altitudes, or make precise astronomical measurements, flat Earth is intuitive default assumption. Ancient civilizations made this assumption because they lacked evidence otherwise - not because they had superior knowledge later suppressed. As Greek astronomy developed (6th-3rd century BCE), evidence accumulated for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, travelers reporting sun angle changes with latitude. By 3rd century BCE, educated Greeks knew Earth was spherical and Eratosthenes calculated its circumference with remarkable accuracy. Babylonians predated these Greek discoveries. PROBLEMS WITH FLAT EARTH INTERPRETATION: 1) APPEAL TO ANTIQUITY FALLACY: Age doesn't equal accuracy. Ancient civilizations believed many things we now know are incorrect (geocentrism, four elements, miasma disease theory, etc.). Being old doesn't make a belief correct. 2) CHERRY-PICKING: Flat Earthers cite Babylonian flat Earth map while ignoring later Greek discoveries of spherical Earth (same ancient world, just slightly later). Ancient Greeks (Pythagoras, Aristotle, Eratosthenes) knew Earth was spherical centuries before Common Era. Why accept Babylonian flat model but reject Greek spherical model from same era? 3) COSMOLOGICAL VS GEOGRAPHIC: Babylonian map is cosmological diagram, not geographic map. It depicts world as Babylonians conceptualized it religiously/philosophically, not as they measured it scientifically. Using it as evidence for Earth's actual shape misunderstands its purpose. 4) TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS: Babylonians lacked technology to detect Earth's curvature. Their flat model reflects observational limitations, not superior knowledge. As technology improved (ocean navigation, high-altitude flight, satellite imagery), spherical Earth became undeniable. 5) SUBSEQUENT VERIFICATION: Every technological advance since ancient times has confirmed spherical Earth - global circumnavigation, aerial photography, satellite imagery, GPS, international space programs. If ancient flat Earth model were correct, these technologies would have revealed it. Instead, all confirm sphere. IRONY: Image presents Babylonian map as evidence for flat Earth, but: Archaeological study of this exact tablet has been conducted by spherical Earth-accepting scholars who understand it as cosmological document reflecting ancient worldview limitations. British Museum where tablet resides operates on assumption of spherical Earth (shipping artifacts internationally requires spherical Earth navigation). Academic consensus studying ancient Near Eastern cosmology understands these maps as historical artifacts showing how ancient peoples conceptualized their world with limited information, not as accurate geographic representations. Tablet is evidence of how humans understood world before developing technology to observe it accurately - exactly the kind of artifact that demonstrates why scientific progress matters. Babylonians did their best with available information; we now have better information confirming spherical Earth. VISUAL ANALYSIS: Tablet's fragmentary condition adds authenticity - clearly ancient artifact, not modern fabrication. Museum-quality photography suggests legitimate archaeological documentation. Cuneiform script readable by scholars confirms Babylonian origin and content. Map's distinctive circular design with triangular projections is recognizable to anyone familiar with ancient Near Eastern cartography. Image effectively uses genuine historical artifact to support flat Earth narrative by presenting ancient belief as validation of modern conspiracy theory. But closer examination reveals artifact supports opposite conclusion: ancient peoples believed flat Earth due to observational limitations; modern technology has proven them incorrect. Citing their beliefs as evidence is argument from ignorance, not argument from knowledge. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) indicates this archaeological photograph repurposed for conspiracy theory promotion. Original artifact is genuine; interpretation imposed upon it is misleading. Effectiveness comes from: Visual authority of authentic ancient artifact, appeal to antiquity (old = true), implication that modern science suppresses ancient wisdom. But archaeological and historical context demonstrates artifact reflects ancient limitations, not ancient truths about Earth's shape.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 377 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Ancient Babylonian clay tablet world map from 6th century BCE cited as evidence ancients knew Earth was flat.
