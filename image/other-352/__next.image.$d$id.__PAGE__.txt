3:T14a1,Aerial river system photograph claiming rivers prove flat Earth. Aerial or satellite photograph showing braided river system from high altitude with text claiming rivers' behavior proves Earth must be flat. Image shows dramatic natural landscape - complex river system viewed from airplane or satellite creating intricate patterns across terrain. River appears as braided channel system - multiple interconnected channels weaving, splitting, and rejoining across wide floodplain creating characteristic anastomosing (braided) pattern. Channels appear as darker blue-gray ribbons contrasting with lighter tan/beige sediment deposits between channels. River flows across frame from upper right toward lower left, channels constantly dividing around sediment islands/bars then merging again. Braided rivers form when river carries heavy sediment load and has variable flow, creating constantly shifting channels. Sediment deposits appear as lighter colored areas - sandbars, islands, floodplain deposits showing where sediment settles during lower flow. Some vegetated areas visible as slightly darker patches. Water in channels shows various blue tones suggesting different depths or turbidity. Background shows broader landscape context - appears to be coastal or delta region where river meets larger water body. Horizon visible in distance showing water or ocean in blue-gray tones. Sky above shows gradient from pale blue at horizon to deeper blue higher up, with wispy white clouds creating subtle patterns. Atmospheric perspective makes distant features appear hazier. Landscape appears relatively flat/low-relief typical of river deltas or alluvial plains where sediment deposition creates level terrain. Text overlay at top in large white sans-serif letters: "RIVERS PROVE FLAT EARTH" making bold claim about implications of river behavior. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme's argument: Rivers flow to sea finding lowest level, water always seeks level surface, rivers create flat plains through sediment deposition, therefore Earth must be flat for rivers to function. Logic suggests water couldn't flow "around curve" or rivers would have to flow uphill over Earth's curvature. However, argument fundamentally misunderstands gravity and how "level" works on spherical planet. Scientific reality: 1) Rivers flow downhill following gravity gradient toward Earth's center, not geometric level independent of gravity. "Level" means perpendicular to gravity vector (toward Earth's center), not parallel to geometric plane. On spherical Earth, "level" at all points means following surface curvature - what we perceive as level surface is actually curved surface equidistant from Earth's center. 2) Water seeks lowest gravitational potential energy, which means closest to Earth's center of mass. On sphere, this creates curved surface (geoid) following Earth's shape. Rivers flow "downhill" along this curved surface toward sea level (which is itself curved surface equidistant from Earth's center). 3) Rivers don't need to "know" Earth is round - just follow gravity. Gravity points toward Earth's center from all locations, so water naturally follows curved paths. Same principle explains why oceans curve with Earth - water surface always perpendicular to gravity vector. 4) River behavior (meandering, braiding, delta formation) results from local topography, sediment load, flow dynamics - same processes work identically whether Earth is spherical or flat. River science (fluvial geomorphology) uses consistent physics that actually requires spherical Earth for global patterns. Rivers shown in photograph demonstrate normal fluvial processes: braided pattern forms when sediment load exceeds transport capacity causing channel splitting; occurs on both large and small scales worldwide; requires no assumption about Earth's global shape - only local gravity and topography. If Earth were truly flat plane: 1) Gravity would point toward geometric center of plane (not uniformly "down"), causing bizarre water flow patterns, 2) Rivers at different locations would flow in unexpected directions, 3) Sea level wouldn't be consistent across oceans. On spherical Earth: 1) Gravity points toward Earth's center from all locations, 2) "Down" always means toward center, 3) Rivers naturally flow toward oceans following curved surface, 4) Sea level is geoid surface equidistant from Earth's center (corrected for rotation), naturally curves with planet. Mathematical proof: River delta at sea level, river source at elevation 1000 feet. Elevation measured relative to sea level (geoid surface), which follows Earth's curvature. River flows 1000 feet "downhill" following curved gravity gradient. No flowing "around curve" - gravity defines "down" at each point. Meme's visual evidence is irrelevant to claim - rivers would look identical on flat or spherical Earth when viewed from above over limited area. Global river patterns (directions of flow, continental drainage divides, ocean connectivity) make sense on spherical Earth with consistent gravity, but would be chaotic on flat plane with geometric center gravity. Actually proves opposite of claim: rivers' consistent behavior worldwide confirms spherical Earth with uniform gravity field.4:T1371,Spacewalk comparison meme suggesting space EVAs filmed underwater in training facilities. Two-panel comparison image implying astronaut spacewalks are faked using underwater neutral buoyancy training facilities with backgrounds digitally replaced. Format suggests NASA uses underwater footage while claiming it's space. Top panel shows two astronauts in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuits performing underwater training exercise in Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) or similar facility. Scene unmistakably underwater - blue-tinted water surrounds astronauts creating characteristic aquatic environment. Left astronaut appears in full white spacesuit with helmet, working on equipment/mockup below. Right astronaut similarly suited, body oriented differently suggesting three-dimensional movement. Both suits show realistic NASA EVA suit details - white fabric covering, mechanical joints, equipment attachments, helmet visors. Water creates distinctive visual effects: blue color cast throughout scene, slight haziness from particulates in water, different lighting characteristics than vacuum of space. Background shows training facility infrastructure - appears to be walls, equipment, possibly safety divers barely visible in blue water. Scene clearly identifiable as underwater training environment used by NASA, ESA, Russian space program for EVA preparation. Astronauts practice spacewalk procedures in neutral buoyancy pool where water's buoyancy approximately simulates weightlessness, allowing realistic training for space operations. Center shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Bottom panel shows seemingly identical or very similar spacewalk scene but with dramatically different background. Same two astronauts in white spacesuits in essentially same positions/poses working on same equipment, but instead of blue water surrounding them, background now shows black void of space with Earth visible below - vibrant blue oceans, white clouds, curved horizon characteristic of orbital photography. Atmospheric glow visible at Earth's limb. Background appears as genuine space environment from low Earth orbit (ISS altitude ~250 miles). Equipment/hardware astronauts work on appears identical in both panels. Meme's implication: Top image is what actually happens - astronauts underwater in pool. Bottom image is what NASA shows public - same footage with background digitally replaced to simulate space. Suggests spacewalk broadcasts and photographs are composited fakes using underwater training footage with CGI Earth background added in post-production. Conspiracy theory claims astronauts never leave Earth; all "space" activities filmed in studios, underwater, or on aircraft, then backgrounds digitally manipulated. However, meme likely uses actual training footage (top) compared with actual space footage (bottom) to create false equivalency. NASA openly documents NBL training - not secret. Astronauts spend hundreds of hours in 40-foot-deep, 6.2-million-gallon pool practicing specific EVA tasks on full-scale ISS mockups before actual spacewalks. Training footage is publicly available, educational, and clearly identified as training. Differences between underwater training and actual spacewalk are obvious to careful observer: 1) Water creates blue tint, haze, bubbles (visible as astronauts move) - absent in space, 2) Underwater, astronauts' suits are weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy; in space, no weight needed, 3) Safety divers accompany underwater training - absent in space, 4) Underwater movement shows fluid dynamics; space movement shows pure momentum, 5) Equipment in water shows buoyancy effects; in space shows weightlessness. Space footage characteristics impossible to fake with underwater footage: 1) Perfect clarity without haze, 2) Absolute black sky, 3) Bright unfiltered sunlight creating harsh shadows, 4) Earth background showing correct orbital mechanics (moves across frame as ISS orbits), 5) Microgravity physics distinctly different from neutral buoyancy. Extensive evidence confirms real spacewalks occur: 1) ISS visible to naked eye from ground - can watch astronauts exit station through telescope, 2) Amateur radio operators track EVA communications, 3) Multiple nations conduct EVAs (USA, Russia, China, ESA) - competing nations wouldn't collaborate on hoax, 4) Decades of spacewalks with consistent physics, 5) Repairs and construction on ISS documented through multiple missions over 20+ years, 6) Astronauts from many countries participate including former Cold War adversaries. If using underwater footage, impossible to fake: consistent Earth rotation in background, orbital sunrise/sunset timing, stars positions matching time/date, hardware degradation over years from space radiation visible in photos. Meme's power comes from visual similarity - same suits, same positions - allowing false equivalency. Requires no technical knowledge to seem convincing to conspiracy-minded viewers.5:Tec1,Inspirational climbing stairs metaphor encouraging truth-seeking about flat Earth. Artistic composite photograph showing man ascending invisible staircase with motivational quote about determination overcoming suppression. Image combines real photography with digital art to create surreal scene. Lower half shows shallow water surface creating mirror-like reflection - appears as calm body of water (ocean, lake, or flooded salt flat) with perfectly still surface reflecting sky above. Water appears blue-gray with slight ripples creating textured surface. Man stands on water in center-left, dressed in dark clothing (black t-shirt, dark pants), body positioned as if climbing stairs - left leg raised stepping upward, right leg on lower invisible step, torso leaning forward in climbing posture, right arm hanging naturally. Man appears in mid-step ascending. His reflection visible in water below showing mirror image. Man's reflection appears slightly transparent/ghosted creating ethereal effect suggesting metaphysical journey or transitional state between ignorance and enlightenment. Right side shows series of ascending stairs floating impossibly in air - approximately 12-15 steps arranged in straight ascending line from lower right to upper right. Stairs appear translucent blue-teal color with slight transparency allowing sky to show through, suggesting they're made of glass, ice, or purely metaphorical constructs. Steps evenly spaced creating regular staircase pattern. No physical support structure - stairs suspended in air defying physics, emphasizing symbolic/metaphorical nature. Background shows realistic sky - gradient from lighter blue-white at horizon to deeper blue higher up, wispy white cirrus clouds stretched across sky creating peaceful atmospheric scene. Sky suggests dawn or dusk lighting with soft diffused illumination. Overall composition creates dreamlike surreal quality - real man in impossible situation (walking on water, climbing invisible stairs) suggesting metaphorical journey. Text overlay at top in dark blue sans-serif font spanning width of image: "If his was more than just a vague ambition, if he was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him." Quote suggests powerful forces attempt to suppress truth but cannot stop genuinely determined truth-seekers. Pronoun "we" implies speaker is part of establishment/controllers trying to maintain false narrative. Quote frames flat Earth belief as hidden truth being actively suppressed but accessible to those with sufficient determination. Center-right shows "Flat Earth Matters" text in light blue/gray transparent overlay - movement slogan/branding. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text on dark gray banner. Metaphor operates on multiple levels: 1) Climbing stairs represents ascending to higher understanding/enlightenment, 2) Invisible/transparent stairs suggest truth-path is hidden but real - requires faith/determination to follow, 3) Walking on water evokes biblical miracle imagery (Jesus walking on water), positioning truth-seeker as having transcendent power, 4) Reflection in water suggests looking deeper than surface appearances, 5) Surreal impossible scenario emphasizes extraordinary nature of flat Earth "revelation." Quote likely adapted from George Orwell or similar source about truth and determination, repurposed for flat Earth context. Suggests establishment can suppress information, control media, manipulate education, but cannot ultimately prevent determined individual from discovering "truth." Frames flat Earth research as heroic individual quest against oppressive system. However, scientific truth isn't hidden - evidence for spherical Earth is openly available and directly observable.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-352","title":"Other 352","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12809647_471367233063016_5011649272723625420_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-351","title":"Other 351","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806182_473326522867087_8485398906805130981_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-353","title":"Other 353","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814198_470149446518128_7671363145091647558_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
