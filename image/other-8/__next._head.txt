5:T482,Wet tennis ball physics meme challenging globe Earth water adhesion. Shows high-speed photography of wet fuzzy yellow-green tennis ball with water droplets dramatically spraying off in circular pattern against black background, creating spectacular radial splash formation. Top text in italic: 'A spinning wet tennis ball has the exact opposite effect of the supposed "ball-Earth". Any water poured over it simply falls off the sides, and giving it a spin results in water flying off 360 degrees like a dog shaking after a bath.' Middle text: 'Astronomers profess the wet tennis ball example displays the opposite effect of their supposed ball-Earth, but claim that at some unknown mass, the magic adhesive properties of gravity suddenly kick in allowing the spinning wet tennis ball-Earth to keep every drop of "gravitized" water stuck to the surface.' Bottom: 'Again, their theory flies in the face of all practical evidence, but they have been running with it for 500 years, so why stop now?' Footer: 'WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/FLATEART-RESEARCH'.
