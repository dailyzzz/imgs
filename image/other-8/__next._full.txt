Bottom question: 'How are the clouds behind it?' Watermark: 'Nick Tracki'. Argues that if sun were 93 million miles away, all clouds in Earth's atmosphere should appear in front of sun, while these images allegedly show clouds behind sun, suggesting much closer local sun consistent with flat Earth model. Mainstream explanation: optical illusion from cloud shadows and perspective making dark cloud portions appear behind bright sun"}}]
