3:T5c5,Multi-panel infographic questioning Einstein's gravity theory featuring physicist John Moffat. Left panel shows text from Wikipedia: 'Could it be, nevertheless, that Einstein's theory is wrong? Might it be necessary to modify it—to find a new theory of gravity that can explain both the stronger gravity and the apparent antigravity being observed today—rather than simply throwing in invisible things to make the standard model work? • John Moffat, Introduction, Reinventing Gravity (2008) p. xi.' Below shows photograph of elderly John Moffat in front of blackboard with equations, labeled 'Wikipedia' and 'John Moffat (physicist)'. Additional quote: 'Giving up Einstein's theory of gravity is simply unacceptable to many in the community. It may take a new generation of physicists to view the evidence with unclouded eyes. • John Moffat, Reinventing Gravity (2008) Epilogue, p. 221.' Right panels show two-part density vs gravity comparison. Top: Hot air balloon floating above clouds at sunset with red upward arrows, captioned 'So Density causes things to rise because they are lighter than the air around them?' labeled 'Gravity off'. Bottom: Skydiver falling through sky with downward red arrow, captioned 'But Density doesn't cause things to lower because they are heavier than the air around them???' labeled 'Gravity on?' Argues that density alone (without gravity) explains why light objects rise and heavy objects fall, questioning why gravity is necessary0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-15","title":"Gravity 15","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/38652725_1770600612977034_5923216125495083008_o.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-14","title":"Gravity 14","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/34510275_2219864411361686_7769784632341430272_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme mocking Einstein gravity demonstration.
