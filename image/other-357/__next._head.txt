5:T16f8,Relative versus universal gravity direction infographic comparing globe and flat Earth models. Two-panel educational-style diagram contrasting how "up" and "down" work on spherical Earth versus flat Earth, arguing for universal absolute directions. Black background with white text creating stark high-contrast design. Top panel labeled "RELATIVE" shows globe Earth model. Left side displays multiple small spherical Earths arranged in circle, each showing different orientation. Each Earth shows blue oceans, green-brown continents, white clouds. From each Earth, colored arrows point in different directions indicating "up" and "down" relative to that Earth's surface. Red arrows labeled "UP" point away from Earth's surface (radially outward). Red arrows labeled "DOWN" point toward Earth's center. Green/teal arrows labeled "DOWN" also shown. Small white human figure icons positioned on some Earth surfaces showing different orientations - one standing upright, one sideways, one upside-down relative to viewer's perspective, demonstrating how "down" changes depending on location on sphere. Arrows show gravity vectors pointing toward each Earth's center from all surface points. Center shows directional indicators suggesting motion or rotation with white arrows. Right side shows large text "RELATIVE" in white capital letters emphasizing concept that directions are location-dependent on globe. Bottom panel labeled "UNIVERSAL" shows flat Earth model. Image displays classic flat Earth dome/snow globe model - circular flat disc under transparent dome. Earth disc shows continents arranged flat with North Pole at center (azimuthal equidistant projection), surrounded by ocean, Antarctica forming ice ring around perimeter. Dome over Earth rendered semi-transparent showing curve. Sun and moon visible as small luminous bodies inside dome. Flat plane appears level/horizontal. White arrows at left and right edges point upward labeled "UP" in white text with white arrows. Red arrows at left and right edges point downward labeled "DOWN" in red text with red downward arrows. Arrows indicate universal absolute directions - up is always perpendicular to flat plane upward, down always perpendicular downward toward underside of plane. No variation based on location - all points on flat Earth share same "up" and "down." Large text "UNIVERSAL" in white capital letters emphasizes concept of absolute unchanging directions. Bottom attribution "fb.com/oierraeplana" in red on white background. Diagram argues flat Earth superior because provides absolute reference frame with universal directions, while globe Earth has relative directions that change based on position. Suggests absurdity of "relative" directions where people in Australia are "upside down" relative to people in North America. Implies globe model is unintuitive or nonsensical. However, diagram misrepresents physics and creates false problem. Scientific reality: "Down" on spherical Earth is not arbitrary or confusing - it's simply direction toward Earth's center, defined by gravity. Gravity on sphere points radially inward toward center of mass. This creates consistent local reference frame at every location - "down" means toward ground, "up" means away from ground, regardless of where you are on planet. Observers at all locations experience same sensation - standing upright on ground surface with sky above. No one is actually "upside down" because "down" is defined by gravity, not by external geometric reference frame. On spherical Earth with uniform gravity, each location has own local vertical, but all verticals point toward Earth's center - this is feature, not bug. Allows consistent physics everywhere. Standing in Australia feels identical to standing in North America - both experience gravity pulling feet toward ground. "Relative" is not problem but solution - it's how physics actually works through reference frames. Flat Earth model in diagram creates actual problems diagram doesn't address: 1) If down is truly universal (same direction everywhere), gravity would need to point in same absolute direction from all locations on flat plane. This would mean gravity points toward geometric center of disc (not uniformly "down"). People near edges would experience gravity pulling them toward center, not straight down through ground. 2) Universal down contradicts observation - we measure gravity pointing perpendicular to local ground everywhere. If plane were truly flat with universal down, gravity measurements would vary with position on disc. 3) Dome model shown has no physical basis - what material is dome? What holds it up? Why does sun/moon move inside dome? How do spacecraft exit? Diagram's visual appeal comes from simplicity - flat plane with uniform directions seems intuitively easier to understand than sphere with location-dependent directions. However, intuition based on limited experience. We live on such large sphere that we experience only tiny fraction of surface at once, making it appear flat. Once scale is understood, spherical model with radial gravity is both simpler (follows from mass distribution) and matches all observations. "Relative" vs "Universal" framing is false dichotomy. Physical laws are universal - gravity always points toward center of mass. What changes is local expression of universal law. On sphere, universal gravity law creates location-dependent vertical directions. On hypothetical flat plane, same gravity law would create completely different (and non-observed) effects. Diagram essentially argues: "wouldn't it be nice if Earth were flat so directions were simpler?" But universe doesn't conform to human preference for simplicity. Actual observations (ships over horizon, different star constellations in different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, satellite orbits) all confirm spherical Earth with radial gravity.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 357 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Relative versus universal gravity direction infographic comparing globe and flat Earth models.
