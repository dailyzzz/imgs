3:T4cb,Astronaut helmet visor reflection with Leonardo da Vinci quote. Top half shows close-up of white space helmet with large curved visor. Reflection in visor shows Earth's horizon - flat-appearing horizon line where brown/tan landmass meets deep blue space/sky. Thin bright blue atmospheric layer visible at horizon. Black space with stars visible in background. Space suit's white fabric visible on sides with ribbed texture. Center of visor reflection shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Black background below helmet contains white italicized quote: '"If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings." ~ Leonardo da Vinci'. Quote encourages empiricism and personal observation over accepting authority. Applied to flat Earth context, argues direct observation (horizon appears flat in space) should override scientific authority (Earth is sphere). Uses da Vinci's reputation as Renaissance polymath to legitimize questioning mainstream science. Suggests astronauts' own observations from space would reveal flat Earth if not constrained by NASA narrative4:T494,Moon landing conspiracy meme questioning photography logistics. Shows black and white photograph supposedly from Apollo moon landing. Image displays lunar surface with gray rocky/dusty terrain in foreground. Apollo Lunar Module (LM) visible in upper right with gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, distinctive angular shape, landing legs. Deep black space/sky as backdrop with no visible stars. Photograph appears taken from external vantage point on moon's surface showing both terrain and spacecraft. Top text in bold white letters: 'HERE IS A PICTURE OF JUST BEFORE NASA LANDED ON THE MOON.' Bottom text: 'THE ONLY PROBLEM IS.....WHO TOOK THE PICTURE?' Bottom right watermark 'mematic.net'. Conspiracy argument questions who photographed lunar module if astronauts were inside about to land. Suggests either photo is fake/staged or other entities were already on moon. Ignores explanation that photo could be from orbiting command module, previous missions, or remote cameras. Moon landing skeptics use photographic inconsistencies and logical questions to cast doubt on Apollo program authenticity. Implies NASA's moon landing narrative contains logical impossibilities5:T6ed,Collage showing top 10 longest rivers in world with flat Earth argument. Grid layout of 10 numbered aerial photographs showing various rivers and landscapes. Images show: 1. Nile River aerial view, 2. Amazon River meandering through rainforest, 3. Dramatic mountain/volcano with water, 4. River through green landscape, 5. Wide river delta with sand/mud patterns, 6. Desert landscape with water, 7. River winding through autumn-colored forest, 8. River through bright green vegetation, 9. Brown muddy river, 10. River through dense green forest. Bottom shows blue water/sky background with white text: 'top 10 longest rivers in the world' and website 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Attribution '©Ashlee Webster'. Bottom section lists rivers with details in white text: '1. The Nile River in Northeast Africa, which is 4,132 miles long. 2. The Amazon River in South America, which is 4,000 miles long. 3. The Yangtze River in China, which is 3,917 miles long. 4. The Mississippi/Missouri River in the United States, which is 3,902 miles long. 5. The Yenisei - Angara - Selenga River in Mongolia and Russia, which is 3,445 miles long. 6. The Yellow River in China, which is 3,398 miles long. 7. The Ob – Irtysh River, which runs through Russia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia. It is 3,365 miles long. 8. The Congo – Chambeshi River in Central Africa, which is 2,922 miles long. 9. The Amur – Argun River in Russia, China and Mongolia, which is 2,763 miles long. 10. The Lena River in Russia, which is 2,736 miles long.' Flat Earth argument questions how rivers thousands of miles long can flow downhill on curved surface. Suggests water's natural levelness contradicts spherical Earth model where rivers would have to flow uphill/downhill following curvature0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-172","title":"Other 172","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12509638_461855387347534_1925348195871509269_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-171","title":"Other 171","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12508904_455108838022189_6170034040395692587_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-173","title":"Other 173","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12510375_454523174747422_3843744971093066101_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
