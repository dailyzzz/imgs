5:T4cb,Astronaut helmet visor reflection with Leonardo da Vinci quote. Top half shows close-up of white space helmet with large curved visor. Reflection in visor shows Earth's horizon - flat-appearing horizon line where brown/tan landmass meets deep blue space/sky. Thin bright blue atmospheric layer visible at horizon. Black space with stars visible in background. Space suit's white fabric visible on sides with ribbed texture. Center of visor reflection shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Black background below helmet contains white italicized quote: '"If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings." ~ Leonardo da Vinci'. Quote encourages empiricism and personal observation over accepting authority. Applied to flat Earth context, argues direct observation (horizon appears flat in space) should override scientific authority (Earth is sphere). Uses da Vinci's reputation as Renaissance polymath to legitimize questioning mainstream science. Suggests astronauts' own observations from space would reveal flat Earth if not constrained by NASA narrative0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 172 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Astronaut helmet visor reflection with Leonardo da Vinci quote.
