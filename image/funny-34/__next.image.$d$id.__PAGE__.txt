Top text reads 'WHEN YOU BRING A CAT' and bottom text states 'FROM AUSTRALIA TO EUROPE...' Humorous visual joke about gravity and cat orientation when traveling from 'upside down' Australia to 'right side up' Europe on spherical Earth. Cat's upright posture suggests it would remain oriented to Australian 'down' direction, arriving standing upside down in European reference frame. Satirizes gravity confusion between hemispheres"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-33","title":"Funny 33","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/80291742_2431066637159255_561565011151945728_n.jpeg","description":"Kermit the Frog 'But That's None of My Business' meme showing iconic green Muppet character sipping Lipton iced tea against blurred neutral background. Top text reads 'I JUST SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY ON CHRISTMAS PRESENTS'. Bottom text completes thought: 'BY TALKING ABOUT FLAT EARTH WITH MY RELATIVES'. Humorous take on social consequences of discussing flat Earth theory at family gatherings, suggesting controversial topic acts as natural family distance-creator, reducing gift exchange obligations. Classic Kermit tea-sipping meme format used for passive-aggressive observations"},"nextImage":{"id":"funny-35","title":"Funny 35","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/82379547_2584962901540600_2333297720069980160_n.jpeg","description":"Pope Francis meme showing pontiff in white robes at Vatican event with two chefs in white uniforms and chef hats presenting elaborately decorated white globe-shaped cake with continents visible. Architectural background shows Vatican's distinctive glass-paneled ceiling. Top text reads 'Well'. Bottom text states 'AT LEAST FROSTING WILL STICK TO A BALL'. Humorous commentary suggesting even if Earth is spherical, at least frosting successfully adheres to ball-shaped cake unlike water supposedly sticking to spinning globe. Clever play on gravity and adhesion arguments used in flat Earth discussions"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
