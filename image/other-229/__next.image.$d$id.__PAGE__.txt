3:T5bf,Child with globe on head educational indoctrination image. Shows young boy standing in classroom in front of green chalkboard. Boy appears age 7-9, has short brown hair, wears light blue collared button-up shirt. Most striking element: standard desktop globe positioned directly on top of his head like hat - globe shows blue oceans, tan-brown-green continents, sits on traditional bronze/gold stand base. Boy's expression appears serious, slightly confused, looking toward camera with wide eyes and neutral mouth. Hands raised at sides in uncertain gesture. Background shows teal-green chalkboard with white frame, worn and marked from use. Side walls visible in gray-blue color. Top of image displays large white bold text: 'INDOCTRINATION'. Center shows translucent 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text in white letters reads: 'Because when something is true and correct, it must be hammered into the brains of defenseless children'. Image criticizes public education system for teaching globe Earth model to children before they develop critical thinking skills. Globe physically placed on child's head symbolizes forced imposition of worldview. Argues if Earth really were sphere, children would naturally discover this through observation rather than requiring repeated instruction. Claims educational system indoctrinates rather than educates. Suggests starting education with globe Earth as given fact prevents independent inquiry into Earth's actual shape4:T5b0,B.o.B rapper Twitter screenshots defending flat Earth position. Shows composite image with B.o.B promotional photo and Twitter posts. Large background image shows B.o.B (Bobby Ray Simmons Jr.), American rapper, in professional portrait. Wears black fedora hat, white shirt, silver chain necklace, looking to side with thoughtful expression. Text overlays show 'B.o.B' in large white letters. Right side displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Foreground shows three Twitter screenshots from verified account @bobatl with blue checkmark. Top tweet dated '4:20 PM - 25 Jan 2016' reads: 'Once you go flat, you never go back'. Second tweet shows profile image and username 'B.o.B @bobatl' with text: 'I'm going up against the greatest liars in history ... you've been tremendously deceived'. Third tweet from same account reads: 'Don't believe what I say, research what I say'. In January 2016, B.o.B sparked controversy by promoting flat Earth theory on Twitter, engaging in public debate with Neil deGrasse Tyson. B.o.B cited various arguments including lack of visible curvature, questioning official NASA imagery, and lighthouse visibility distances. Tyson responded with scientific explanations, leading to rap battle diss track 'Flatline' where B.o.B attacked mainstream science. Incident brought flat Earth theory into mainstream pop culture discussion. B.o.B's 'research what I say' encourages independent investigation rather than accepting authority5:T592,Space Shuttle with propaganda quote over Earth photograph. Shows Space Shuttle orbiter in low Earth orbit against dramatic Earth backdrop. Shuttle appears in white with black heat-resistant tiles on underside, distinctive delta wing shape, open cargo bay visible with golden/tan colored equipment or satellite inside. Vehicle shows NASA markings. Background displays stunning Earth view from orbit - curved horizon shows atmosphere's blue glow/limb, cloud patterns in white swirls, blue oceans, landmasses in tan-brown-green visible below. Sun illumination creates bright white glare on Earth's surface. Curvature of Earth clearly visible across top of image. Top portion shows white text quote: 'Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.' Quote commonly misattributed to Joseph Goebbels (Nazi propaganda minister) but actual origin uncertain - similar sentiment appears in Hitler's Mein Kampf about 'big lie' technique. Bottom displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Image suggests space program and Earth imagery represent 'big lie' - simple message (Earth is globe) repeated constantly through education, media, NASA imagery until accepted as truth. Ironically uses actual space photograph to argue space imagery is propaganda. Claims mainstream cosmology employs psychological manipulation rather than empirical evidence. Compares NASA to totalitarian propaganda apparatus0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-229","title":"Other 229","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661939_460924460773960_4001955883715102484_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-228","title":"Other 228","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661895_459877520878654_5572573329277913670_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-230","title":"Other 230","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662595_462748497258223_1786959743404400_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
