3:T4bd,Coffee latte art showing flat Earth map continents in foam. Shows overhead view of white ceramic coffee cup with handle on right side, sitting on warm-toned wooden table surface with vertical grain pattern. Cup contains dark black coffee or espresso. Surface of liquid covered with creamy tan-beige foam/crema creating latte art. Foam bubbles and milk create recognizable continental shapes resembling azimuthal equidistant projection flat Earth map. Visible landmasses include what appears to be Europe/Africa on left, Asia center-right, Americas lower portion - arranged in circular pattern radiating from center (North Pole). Smaller bubbles around perimeter could represent Antarctica ice wall or outer ring. Artistic coffee foam naturally formed or deliberately created to replicate flat Earth map layout. Aesthetic combines popular coffee culture with flat Earth imagery. Image likely shared as artistic representation, humor, or community symbolism. Shows how flat Earth map pattern has become recognizable visual motif. Could be intentional latte art by sympathetic barista or coincidental pattern interpreted as validation. Reflects way flat Earth community finds patterns and symbols in everyday objects4:T58b,Scumbag Steve meme criticizing physics evidence for globe Earth. Shows young man in indoor setting wearing tan/brown sideways scumbag hat, white t-shirt. Has somewhat dazed or smug facial expression looking slightly off-camera. Background shows beige/tan walls, Christmas tree visible with decorations and lights, typical residential interior. Light coloring and composition create casual, candid photo aesthetic. Top text in white bold Impact font with black outline: 'BELIEVES PHYSICS OFFERS EVIDENCE OF GLOBE EARTH'. Bottom left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in same font style: 'CAN'T PROVIDE ANY'. Bottom left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Uses Scumbag Steve meme format (originated 2011) depicting naive, hypocritical, or annoying person making contradictory claims. Criticizes globe Earth believers who claim physics proves spherical Earth but allegedly cannot provide convincing demonstrations. Flat Earth argument suggests mainstream science relies on abstract mathematics and theories rather than direct observable proof. Implies physics models are mathematical constructs that don't necessarily reflect reality. Questions concepts like gravity, orbital mechanics, centrifugal force as unproven assumptions rather than demonstrated facts. Reverses burden of proof by suggesting those who believe in globe model cannot actually explain or prove the physics they claim supports it5:T4dc,Book cover for 'The Greatest Lie on Earth' by Edward Hendrie. Shows book cover design with ocean background photograph - dark blue-green water surface with ripples and waves extending to horizon. Sky shows lighter blue gradient. Center displays vintage-style flat Earth azimuthal equidistant map showing continents arranged in circle with North Pole at center. Map shows colored landmasses: Americas in orange/red on left, Europe/Africa in green/yellow top-center, Asia in yellow right side, Australia bottom-right. White Antarctic ring circles outer perimeter. Map appears aged with cream/beige coloring and concentric circles indicating latitude lines. Curved text at top of map reads 'The Greatest Lie on Earth' in white serif font. Curved text below map reads 'Proof That Our World Is Not a Moving Globe' in similar style. Bottom of cover shows author name 'Edward Hendrie' in large white serif letters. Cover design uses authoritative book aesthetic with vintage cartography imagery suggesting historical evidence. Edward Hendrie is author of multiple books promoting flat Earth biblical cosmology and various conspiracy theories. Title claims globe Earth model is deliberate deception or 'greatest lie' rather than honest scientific error0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-214","title":"Other 214","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12642859_459030870963319_3570981260198209356_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-213","title":"Other 213","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12642488_461070304092709_2267447020385932588_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-215","title":"Other 215","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12644705_461801570686249_9202257357073544057_n.png","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
