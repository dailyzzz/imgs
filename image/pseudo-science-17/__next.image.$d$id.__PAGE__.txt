3:T4f5,Quote meme showing physicist Michio Kaku speaking at interview or presentation, wearing dark suit with red tie, animated hand gesture, glasses, with black background showing solar eclipse corona. Top text in white: '"Usually in science, if we're off by a factor of 2 or a factor of 10, we call that horrible. We say, something's wrong with the theory. We're off by a factor of 10! However in cosmology, we're off by a factor of 10 to the 120. That is 1 with a hundred and twenty zeros after it. This is the largest mismatch between theory and experiment in the history of science."' Attribution: '- Michio Kaku' with source '(Interview, The Principle)'. Logo at bottom shows 'THE PRINCIPLE' with solar eclipse image. Quote discusses cosmological constant problem - enormous discrepancy between quantum field theory predictions of vacuum energy density and observed cosmological constant value. Presented to suggest fundamental crisis in cosmology/physics that undermines established science, possibly implying geocentric models are equally valid. Context: quote is about quantum gravity problem and dark energy, not about Earth's position or motion; Kaku advocates mainstream physics including heliocentric model despite acknowledging this unsolved theoretical problem.4:T489,Mobile phone screenshot showing 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE' comparison chart with black background. Title in white 'SCIENCE' and cyan 'PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Left column 'SCIENCE' lists in white text: 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. Right column 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' lists in cyan: 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'SoyceCrashCourse' logo. Status bar shows 70% battery, 11:28 time. Defines characteristics distinguishing legitimate science from pseudoscience methodology.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-17","title":"Pseudo Science 17","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/22552505_10100374163378158_7634864151785625456_n.jpeg","description":"Educational infographic comparing 'SCIENCE' versus 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' with diagram and criteria.
