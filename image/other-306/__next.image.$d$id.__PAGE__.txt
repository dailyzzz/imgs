3:T9ed,Earth's multiple motions with gyroscope stability argument meme. Two-panel educational image arguing gyroscopes would malfunction if Earth had complex motion. Top section shows scientific visualization of solar system motion on black starfield background. Central yellow-orange sun shown as glowing sphere with corona. Curved blue orbital paths trace Earth's movement - multiple elliptical and spiral trajectories overlapping showing Earth's simultaneous motions. Yellow arrow/beam extends from orbital region toward sun suggesting directional movement. Small spheres visible representing planets at different orbital positions - one appears moon-like (gray), another Earth-like (blue-green), yellow/tan planet possibly Venus or Mars. Complex interweaving blue curves illustrate compound motion: Earth rotating on axis, orbiting sun, sun moving through galaxy, galaxy moving through space. White text overlays in sans-serif font: 'IF THIS WAS TRUE', 'EARTH IS ROTATING AT 1,000 MPH' (equatorial rotation speed), 'WHILE REVOLVING AROUND SUN AT 66,600 MPH' (orbital velocity), 'AS THE SUN IS BLASTING THROUGH SPACE AT 450,000 MPH' (solar system's motion through Milky Way). Bottom section displays labeled diagram of mechanical gyroscope on white background. Cross-sectional view shows components: outer 'Gyroscope frame' (gray ring), middle 'Outer gimbal' and 'Inner gimbal' (red/pink rings allowing rotation on multiple axes), central 'Rotor' (yellow disc representing spinning mass), vertical 'Spin axis' (pink rod through center). Diagram demonstrates gimbal suspension allowing rotor to maintain orientation regardless of frame movement. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'ALL GYROSCOPES WOULD BE GOING APE SHIT'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Meme argues if Earth had multiple simultaneous high-speed motions in different directions, gyroscopes would show chaotic behavior rather than stable orientation. However, this misunderstands inertial reference frames and gyroscope physics. Gyroscopes maintain orientation relative to local inertial frame - since all objects on/near Earth share same motions, there's no relative motion to detect. Similar to how gyroscope on moving airplane maintains stability - detects aircraft rotation, not Earth's motion beneath. Earth's rotation IS detectable by precision gyroscopes (demonstrated by Foucault pendulum, ring laser gyroscopes, fiber optic gyroscopes used in navigation), but orbital and galactic motion irrelevant because we're in same reference frame4:T8a0,Side-eyeing Chloe meme about believing spherical Earth despite no visible curvature. Popular internet meme using viral child's skeptical expression. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'NO ONE CAN FIND ANY CURVATURE'. Image shows young blonde girl (Chloe from "Side Eyeing Chloe" meme) sitting in car seat giving intensely skeptical sideways glance. Girl appears approximately 2-3 years old with long straight blonde hair, fair complexion. She wears purple/magenta colored shirt or jacket. Facial expression shows narrowed eyes looking to side with incredulous, unimpressed, judging look - signature expression from viral video where she reacts skeptically to parents' announcement. Gray car interior visible in background with black car seat. Lower right shows 'FEM' watermark (Flat Earth Matters). Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'AND YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S A BALL'. Meme uses child's naturally skeptical expression to mock belief in spherical Earth when curvature allegedly can't be observed. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with alleged 8 inches per mile squared drop, curvature should be easily visible - since people don't see obvious curve, Earth must be flat. However, Earth's radius is 6,371 km (3,959 miles) making curvature imperceptible at human scale on ground level. Curvature becomes visible from altitude: commercial aircraft at 35,000 feet show slight curve (about 3 degrees of horizon), high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curve, ISS at 400 km shows obvious spherical Earth. From ground, horizon distance limited by observer height - at 6 feet tall, geometric horizon only 3 miles away, too short distance to show noticeable curve. However, ships disappearing hull-first over horizon demonstrates curvature. Long-distance photography across large bodies of water also shows hidden portions due to curve. Mathematics of sphere means local area appears flat while global shape is curved - similar to how small section of basketball appears nearly flat when viewed close-up. Meme format originated from viral YouTube video showing Chloe's reaction to Disney trip announcement, became widespread reaction image for skepticism5:T8e8,Wernher von Braun Operation Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist collage arguing NASA founded by Nazis. Multi-panel historical photograph collage highlighting Wernher von Braun's Nazi past and role founding NASA space program. Top section shows two black and white photographs from 1940s Nazi Germany. Left photo: von Braun in dark suit standing among Nazi military officers in Wehrmacht uniforms with caps, military decorations visible. Right photo: Close-up of von Braun in civilian dark suit surrounded by Nazi SS officers in uniform with peaked caps showing Nazi insignia. Photos document his role as technical director of Nazi V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde. Large white text spanning top: 'WERNHER VON BRAUN'. Red text below: 'NAZI ROCKET SCIENTIST'. Middle section shows photographs from post-war America. Left: von Braun in sunglasses standing at Cape Canaveral with rocket launch structures visible in background. Center: Large Saturn V rocket engines/components showing massive F-1 engine bells used in Apollo moon missions. Right: von Braun in suit examining rocket hardware. White text: 'ESCAPING CHARGES IN THE NUREMBERG TRIALS HE WAS LATER SMUGGLED INTO THE U.S. UNDER OPERATION: PAPERCLIP'. Bottom section shows NASA era photos. Left: Elderly von Braun in NASA facility. Center: Row of Saturn V rockets displayed vertically. Right: von Braun in suit standing before rockets. Large white text: 'WHERE HE WAS MADE 1ST DIRECTOR OF NASA'S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER'. Lower right: 'Nick Havok' signature. Collage presents historical facts about Operation Paperclip - secret program recruiting German scientists after WWII, including von Braun and team. Von Braun used slave labor from Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp during V-2 production, causing thousands of deaths. His SS membership and knowledge of atrocities controversial. However, his technical contributions to US space program undeniable - Saturn V development enabled Apollo moon landings. Meme implies NASA fundamentally tainted by Nazi origins, suggesting space program continues Nazi deception/propaganda. While historical connection factual, modern NASA evolved far beyond von Braun, includes diverse international scientists, operates transparently with public missions verified by independent nations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-306","title":"Other 306","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745760_465537190312687_3964998623303873642_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-305","title":"Other 305","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745681_468153193384420_7173330056612754937_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-307","title":"Other 307","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745930_466668016866271_3802006221260945192_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
