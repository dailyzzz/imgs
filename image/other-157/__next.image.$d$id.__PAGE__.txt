3:T519,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple-lavender tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Multiple layers of pink-orange clouds create dramatic sky. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to took downwards at the horizon.' [Note: text contains typo 'took' instead of 'look']. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe4:T579,Vintage educational map poster from CBS American School of the Air. Decorative beige/cream border with ornate corner designs. Header banner reads 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with subtitle 'AIR MAP OF THE WORLD - A POLAR PROJECTION'. Top corners show two small traditional globe projections. Center features large azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center, showing all continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink/salmon (North America), yellow (Asia), orange (Europe), green (South America, Africa, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. Curved flight paths/routes drawn across map connecting various cities. Outer ring marked with yellow circles indicating time zones or sun positions. Bottom left shows grid reference chart. Bottom center displays vintage CBS microphone illustration. Right side contains lengthy text explaining map's educational purpose and CBS programming details. Bottom text: 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with broadcast dates '15th Season October 12, 1945-April 26, 1946'. Historical educational material using azimuthal equidistant projection for radio broadcasting and aviation. Bottom watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Flat Earth proponents cite vintage educational use of this projection as evidence authorities knew Earth's true shape, though projection is standard for polar aviation/radio regardless of Earth's actual shape5:T530,Serene sunset photograph over large body of water with superior mirage question. Shows brilliant orange-yellow sun partially visible above horizon with gray-orange clouds above. Sun creates golden reflection column stretching vertically down across calm water surface toward viewer. Sky transitions from peachy-orange near sun through tan/beige tones to darker gray at top. Multiple dark birds silhouetted in flight - one upper left, one upper right, one middle-right, one lower center. Distant city skyline visible as thin dark silhouette on horizon to left of sun. Foreground shows dark shoreline with silhouettes of people - person sitting/crouching on left, two figures standing together on right. Water appears almost mirror-smooth with gentle ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level. Large bold white text at bottom: 'SUPERIOR MIRAGE?' Questions whether sun's appearance at sunset/sunrise is optical illusion (superior mirage) caused by atmospheric refraction rather than actual position. Superior mirages occur when temperature inversions bend light rays, making objects appear higher than actual location. Flat Earth proponents question whether sun truly sets below horizon or merely appears to due to perspective and atmospheric effects, suggesting sun circles above flat plane rather than Earth rotating0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-157","title":"Other 157","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12485943_454879928045080_1353300195191586290_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-156","title":"Other 156","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12484610_455543597978713_2113885493044286911_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-158","title":"Other 158","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12487091_450548285144911_6905234098492399288_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
