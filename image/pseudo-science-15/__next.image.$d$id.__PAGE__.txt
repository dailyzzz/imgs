3:T4f3,Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of bearded man with glasses, bow tie, and formal Victorian-era suit jacket. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'A great deal of research has been carried out concerning the influence of the Earth's movement. The results were always negative.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, HENRI POINCARÉ •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote from Henri Poincaré (French mathematician and theoretical physicist, founder of topology, pioneer of special relativity theory) discussing null results of experiments attempting to detect Earth's absolute motion through space (referencing Michelson-Morley and similar experiments). Quote taken out of context - Poincaré was discussing experimental basis for relativity principle, explaining that negative results led to understanding that uniform motion is relative and no absolute reference frame exists, not that Earth is stationary. His work directly contributed to Einstein's special relativity. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's description of null experimental results as denial of Earth's motion, omitting that Poincaré interpreted this as supporting principle of relativity rather than geocentrism.4:T492,Quote meme with famous black and white portrait of Albert Einstein with characteristic wild gray hair, mustache, wearing wool sweater, looking directly at camera with gentle expression. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'We can't feel our motion through space, nor has any physical experiment ever proved that the Earth actually is in motion.' followed by attribution '• HISTORIAN, LINCOLN BARNETT, FOREWORD BY ALBERT EINSTEIN •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote attributed to Lincoln Barnett (science writer) with Einstein's endorsement via foreword, discussing perceptual and experimental challenges in detecting Earth's motion. Taken out of context - quote likely discusses principle of relativity (motion is relative to reference frame) rather than denying Earth's motion. Selective quote mining using Einstein's association to suggest even relativity theory supports stationary Earth, though Einstein's work assumes Earth orbits Sun and explains why uniform motion cannot be detected from within moving reference frame. Conflates inability to feel/measure absolute motion with claim Earth is stationary.5:T4f5,Quote meme showing physicist Michio Kaku speaking at interview or presentation, wearing dark suit with red tie, animated hand gesture, glasses, with black background showing solar eclipse corona. Top text in white: '"Usually in science, if we're off by a factor of 2 or a factor of 10, we call that horrible. We say, something's wrong with the theory. We're off by a factor of 10! However in cosmology, we're off by a factor of 10 to the 120. That is 1 with a hundred and twenty zeros after it. This is the largest mismatch between theory and experiment in the history of science."' Attribution: '- Michio Kaku' with source '(Interview, The Principle)'. Logo at bottom shows 'THE PRINCIPLE' with solar eclipse image. Quote discusses cosmological constant problem - enormous discrepancy between quantum field theory predictions of vacuum energy density and observed cosmological constant value. Presented to suggest fundamental crisis in cosmology/physics that undermines established science, possibly implying geocentric models are equally valid. Context: quote is about quantum gravity problem and dark energy, not about Earth's position or motion; Kaku advocates mainstream physics including heliocentric model despite acknowledging this unsolved theoretical problem.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-15","title":"Pseudo Science 15","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19420852_247795982375215_1772048712753929792_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-14","title":"Pseudo Science 14","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19400126_247795952375218_613806335517901807_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-16","title":"Pseudo Science 16","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/20914377_10214443001733330_5665252270913149851_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
