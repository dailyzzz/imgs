3:T40c,Two-panel comparison meme demonstrating simultaneous sunset and sunrise. Top panel shows dusky sunset scene over water in Japan with pinkish-orange sky, dark silhouette of vehicle and landscape, reflection on water surface. Caption reads 'I sent my parents a picture of the sunset in Japan.' Bottom panel shows golden sunrise over ocean in Florida with bright yellow sun partially above horizon, layered clouds, blue water reflecting sunlight. Caption reads 'They sent me a picture 20 minutes later of the sunrise from Florida.' Below panels shows Tumblr/social media conversation: 'unwinona:', 'tattoos-n-tokes Deactivated.', 'this is why the world is beautiful. maybe its just me but i find this cool as fuck', and '*Your kid says hi.' -The sun'. Watermark 'Poxlize' at bottom. Demonstrates Earth's rotation causing simultaneous day/night in different locations, though sometimes used in flat Earth discussions to question how sun can set and rise simultaneously on spherical Earth (actually expected due to Earth's rotation and size)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-21","title":"The Sun 21","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/29101204_1949928765077761_4140675758441889792_n.jpeg","description":"Humorous skeleton meme showing contemplative skeleton sitting in brown leather chair by fireplace, hand on chin in thinking pose.

Left side shows bright orange fireplace flames with '@FREDENKLW' watermark visible. Questions how scientists determined sun's mass (approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg) from Earth. Implies measurement is impossible or fabricated due to distance. Actually, solar mass is calculated through gravitational effects on planets using Kepler's laws and Newton's law of universal gravitation, not direct weighing. Earth's orbital period and distance allow precise calculation without physical contact.

Bright golden-yellow sun rays (crepuscular rays) burst dramatically through gaps in dark gray cloud layers, creating spectacular light beams radiating downward and across scene. Multiple layers of clouds at different altitudes show varying illumination: some backlit with golden edges, others appearing dark gray in silhouette. Upper atmosphere shows mixture of gold and dark tones with clouds breaking apart. Lower portion shows golden rays reflecting off ocean surface creating shimmering path. Sky displays dramatic color gradient from bright golden-yellow where sun breaks through to darker gray-brown in shadowed areas. Classic example of crepuscular rays - parallel sunlight appearing to diverge due to perspective, creating spectacular atmospheric light show often used in discussions about sun's distance and light ray geometry"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
