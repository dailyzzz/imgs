Shows long hotel hallway with warm orange/yellow lighting, brown patterned carpet runner, cream walls, wall sconces, and doors on both sides extending toward vanishing point. Bottom text in white italics: 'You can't even see the end of a Hallway!' with 'TruthPirates.com' watermark. Uses inability to see corridor's end due to perspective and lighting as satirical analogy for why distant locations aren't visible on flat Earth. Demonstrates that visual limitations (perspective convergence, atmospheric effects, lighting) prevent seeing indefinitely regardless of terrain flatness."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-21","title":"Perspective 21","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/48365584_2365589123469467_2205458946217476096_n.jpeg","description":"Six-panel comparison meme demonstrating perspective on flat surfaces. Top text: 'the coin doesn't disappear over curvature (table is flat)'. Left three panels show hand holding coin above flat wooden table surface at progressively lower heights, labeled 'sky' (coin high above table), 'ground' (coin at table level), and bottom panel shows coin on table surface with perspective grid overlay. Right three panels show sunset over ocean from pier/boardwalk perspective with silhouetted figures and bikes, demonstrating sun at different heights: above horizon labeled 'sky', at horizon level labeled 'ground', and below horizon with perspective grid overlay. Bottom panel shows perspective grid lines converging on both table surface and ocean horizon. Large bottom text: 'NEITHER DOES SUN.' with 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' logo and '@rum_bellator' credit. Argues sun setting below horizon is perspective effect identical to coin appearing to sink below table edge when viewed at ground level, not evidence of Earth curvature."},"nextImage":null}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
