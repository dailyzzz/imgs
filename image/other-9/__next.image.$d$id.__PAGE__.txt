3:T482,Wet tennis ball physics meme challenging globe Earth water adhesion. Shows high-speed photography of wet fuzzy yellow-green tennis ball with water droplets dramatically spraying off in circular pattern against black background, creating spectacular radial splash formation. Top text in italic: 'A spinning wet tennis ball has the exact opposite effect of the supposed "ball-Earth". Any water poured over it simply falls off the sides, and giving it a spin results in water flying off 360 degrees like a dog shaking after a bath.' Middle text: 'Astronomers profess the wet tennis ball example displays the opposite effect of their supposed ball-Earth, but claim that at some unknown mass, the magic adhesive properties of gravity suddenly kick in allowing the spinning wet tennis ball-Earth to keep every drop of "gravitized" water stuck to the surface.' Bottom: 'Again, their theory flies in the face of all practical evidence, but they have been running with it for 500 years, so why stop now?' Footer: 'WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/FLATEART-RESEARCH'.

Top text: 'If the sun is 93 million miles away'. Four photographs show sun at different times with varying cloud positions relative to solar disc: top-left shows sun partially obscured by dark clouds creating layered effect, top-right shows sun behind lighter clouds, bottom-left shows sun low on horizon with dark foreground clouds, bottom-right shows sun with dramatic orange-red sunset clouds. Bottom question: 'How are the clouds behind it?' Watermark: 'Nick Tracki'. Argues that if sun were 93 million miles away, all clouds in Earth's atmosphere should appear in front of sun, while these images allegedly show clouds behind sun, suggesting much closer local sun consistent with flat Earth model.
