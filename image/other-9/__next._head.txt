Top text: 'If the sun is 93 million miles away'. Four photographs show sun at different times with varying cloud positions relative to solar disc: top-left shows sun partially obscured by dark clouds creating layered effect, top-right shows sun behind lighter clouds, bottom-left shows sun low on horizon with dark foreground clouds, bottom-right shows sun with dramatic orange-red sunset clouds. Bottom question: 'How are the clouds behind it?' Watermark: 'Nick Tracki'. Argues that if sun were 93 million miles away, all clouds in Earth's atmosphere should appear in front of sun, while these images allegedly show clouds behind sun, suggesting much closer local sun consistent with flat Earth model. Mainstream explanation: optical illusion from cloud shadows and perspective making dark cloud portions appear behind bright sun"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Other 9"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Four-panel sun distance meme questioning 93 million mile claim.
