5:T9b8,Flight paths comparison between globe and flat Earth map. Split-screen comparison of airline routes questioning globe Earth model. Top text spans both panels: 'THESE ARE THE FLIGHT PATHS ON A GLOBE. THEY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.' and 'SAME FLIGHTS ON A FLAT EARTH MAP. WHICH ONE MAKES MORE SENSE?'. Left panel shows Mercator projection map with blue oceans, green continents. Red curved lines trace flight routes originating from lower left (appears to be Auckland, New Zealand) fanning outward to various destinations in Americas. Routes curve across Pacific Ocean showing great circle paths: New Zealand to western USA (Alaska, Seattle, San Francisco area), central USA (possibly Texas area), southern USA, Mexico, Central America, and South America (Chile/Argentina area). Five distinct red curved paths visible. Geographic labels include 'United States', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Peru', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Venezuela', 'Colombia', 'Puerto Rico', 'Cuba', 'North Pacific Ocean', 'North Atlantic Ocean', 'South Pacific Ocean', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Coral Sea', 'Tasman Sea', 'New Zealand'. Map uses standard latitude/longitude grid. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Right panel displays azimuthal equidistant projection (common flat Earth map) centered on North Pole. Continents radiate outward from central white circle (Arctic). Same red flight routes now appear as more direct straight or gently curved lines across projection. Routes from Australia/New Zealand region to Americas look shorter and more direct compared to globe paths. Dark blue ocean, tan/green continents, white ice. Latitude/longitude grid visible. Flat Earth argument claims airlines would fly different routes if Earth were sphere - routes appear longer and more circuitous on globe but direct on flat map. However, this is projection distortion illusion. On globe, great circle routes (shortest distance between two points on sphere) appear as straight lines from above but as curves on 2D Mercator map. Azimuthal projection from South Pole perspective would show these routes as straight lines because it preserves distances from center point, but distorts everywhere else. Airlines actually DO fly great circle routes shown on globe - these ARE the shortest paths when measured on spherical surface. Flat Earth map is itself a projection of spherical Earth data, just using different projection center. Either projection can make routes look 'wrong' if you don't understand how map projections work0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 265 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flight paths comparison between globe and flat Earth map.
