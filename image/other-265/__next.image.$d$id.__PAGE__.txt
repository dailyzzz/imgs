3:T9b8,Flight paths comparison between globe and flat Earth map. Split-screen comparison of airline routes questioning globe Earth model. Top text spans both panels: 'THESE ARE THE FLIGHT PATHS ON A GLOBE. THEY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.' and 'SAME FLIGHTS ON A FLAT EARTH MAP. WHICH ONE MAKES MORE SENSE?'. Left panel shows Mercator projection map with blue oceans, green continents. Red curved lines trace flight routes originating from lower left (appears to be Auckland, New Zealand) fanning outward to various destinations in Americas. Routes curve across Pacific Ocean showing great circle paths: New Zealand to western USA (Alaska, Seattle, San Francisco area), central USA (possibly Texas area), southern USA, Mexico, Central America, and South America (Chile/Argentina area). Five distinct red curved paths visible. Geographic labels include 'United States', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Peru', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Venezuela', 'Colombia', 'Puerto Rico', 'Cuba', 'North Pacific Ocean', 'North Atlantic Ocean', 'South Pacific Ocean', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Coral Sea', 'Tasman Sea', 'New Zealand'. Map uses standard latitude/longitude grid. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Right panel displays azimuthal equidistant projection (common flat Earth map) centered on North Pole. Continents radiate outward from central white circle (Arctic). Same red flight routes now appear as more direct straight or gently curved lines across projection. Routes from Australia/New Zealand region to Americas look shorter and more direct compared to globe paths. Dark blue ocean, tan/green continents, white ice. Latitude/longitude grid visible. Flat Earth argument claims airlines would fly different routes if Earth were sphere - routes appear longer and more circuitous on globe but direct on flat map. However, this is projection distortion illusion. On globe, great circle routes (shortest distance between two points on sphere) appear as straight lines from above but as curves on 2D Mercator map. Azimuthal projection from South Pole perspective would show these routes as straight lines because it preserves distances from center point, but distorts everywhere else. Airlines actually DO fly great circle routes shown on globe - these ARE the shortest paths when measured on spherical surface. Flat Earth map is itself a projection of spherical Earth data, just using different projection center. Either projection can make routes look 'wrong' if you don't understand how map projections work4:T65f,Denzel Washington Training Day meme celebrating flat Earth belief. Popular internet meme format using still frame from 2001 film Training Day starring Denzel Washington. Image shows close-up of Washington's character Detective Alonzo Harris smiling broadly with satisfied, knowing expression. He wears dark clothing and holds cigarette or toothpick in teeth. Background shows blurred light blue-white tones suggesting indoor setting or car interior. Washington's face displays wide genuine smile showing teeth with slight gap, eyes crinkled with joy, overall expression of deep satisfaction and contentment. Top text in bold white capital letters with black outline: 'DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A'. Bottom text in matching style: 'FLAT EARTHER'. Meme format originally captioned 'DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTER' referencing both Training Day's criminal underworld setting and Geto Boys' song 'Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta'. Format used to express satisfaction about belonging to particular group or believing particular thing. In this context, meme celebrates feeling of being flat Earth believer - suggests pride, confidence, satisfaction in rejecting mainstream globe Earth model. Implies flat Earthers feel superior knowledge or enlightenment, part of special group that 'knows the truth'. Common sentiment in conspiracy theory communities where members feel they possess hidden knowledge others lack. Denzel's confident, satisfied expression perfectly captures this feeling of self-assurance. Meme suggests flat Earth belief brings sense of empowerment and community belonging despite (or because of) its fringe status5:T706,Matrix Agent Smith meme about flat Earth censorship. Popular internet meme format using scene from 1999 film The Matrix showing multiple identical Agent Smith characters. Image displays army of Agent Smith clones - approximately 30+ identical figures wearing black suits, white dress shirts, black ties, and dark sunglasses arranged in rows. Figures shown from chest up. All have same pale complexion, short dark hair, stoic serious expressions. Lead agent in center foreground appears slightly larger/closer to camera. Background shows green-tinted interior setting suggesting Matrix environment. Lighting creates somewhat dark, ominous atmosphere. Agents appear unnaturally uniform and synchronized, representing system's enforcers who eliminate threats to established reality. Top text in large bold white letters: 'WHEN YOU POST ABOUT FLAT EARTH'. Bottom text: 'THESE GUYS START LEAVING NEGATIVE COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE TO START WAKING UP'. Lower right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white italics. Meme positions flat Earth believers as Neo-like truth-tellers fighting against system, while critics are Agent Smith-like defenders of official narrative. Suggests coordinated organized opposition trying to suppress flat Earth information to prevent mass awakening. Common conspiracy theory trope where any criticism is reframed as proof of cover-up. In Matrix film, Agent Smiths represent system attempting to maintain control over humans trapped in simulation. Meme draws parallel between Matrix's false reality and alleged false globe Earth model. Implies critics aren't genuine individuals but coordinated agents serving hidden agenda. Reality: critics are independent people pointing out scientific errors in flat Earth claims, not coordinated suppression campaign0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-265","title":"Other 265","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716056_466523323547407_2508931254555573126_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-264","title":"Other 264","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716033_464688487064224_5372428259831862156_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-266","title":"Other 266","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716072_464231873776552_7313360567585154295_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
