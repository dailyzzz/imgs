3:T706,Two-panel comparison claiming superior mirage versus flat Earth proof. Top panel shows photograph of large industrial ship or offshore platform at sea. Structure appears distorted and elevated above horizon - visible sections include white superstructure, red-brown hull sections, industrial equipment, cranes all appearing to float or hover above water line. Image shows classic superior mirage optical effect where atmospheric refraction causes distant objects to appear lifted, inverted, or distorted when cold air sits below warm air creating temperature gradient. Ship components appear segmented and disjointed. Dark blue ocean water fills lower portion. Light gray-blue sky at top. White text overlay at top reads: 'THIS IS A SUPERIOR MIRAGE'. Bottom panel shows similar ocean scene at sunset or sunrise with dramatic sky. Sky displays gradient from pale yellow-cream near horizon transitioning to peachy-orange, then pink, then deeper blue at top. Horizon line shows distant city skyline or industrial structures as small dark silhouettes against bright sky - visible towers, buildings, possibly lighthouse or communications structures. Ocean shows dark blue water. Center displays large 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text in large white bold letters: 'THIS IS PROOF OF FLAT EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' credit. Lower right credits 'Joshua Nowicki'. Comparison attempts to distinguish between superior mirage (temperature inversion atmospheric refraction) and distant visibility allegedly impossible on curved Earth. However, both phenomena can occur on spherical Earth. Superior mirages are well-documented optical effects. Standard refraction calculations account for atmospheric light bending allowing visibility beyond geometric horizon4:T634,3D rendered globe Earth emerging from cardboard box with quote about generational lies. Shows photorealistic 3D illustration on white background. Center displays open brown cardboard shipping box with four flaps opened upward revealing contents. Box shows realistic texture with corrugated edges, tape residue, printed barcode and shipping label visible on side. Inside box sits translucent glowing blue globe Earth - semi-transparent sphere showing dark blue oceans, lighter blue-green continents (visible landmasses include parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas), white cloud patterns, and bright white-blue glowing light emanating from center creating dramatic illumination. Globe appears to float slightly above box bottom. Light rays project outward creating ethereal effect. Box casts soft shadow on white surface below. Right side of box shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline reads: 'WHEN A WELL-PACKAGED WEB OF LIES HAS BEEN SOLD GRADUALLY TO THE MASSES OVER GENERATIONS,' Bottom text in same style: 'THE TRUTH WILL SEEM UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS AND ITS SPEAKER A RAVING LUNATIC.' Quote often misattributed to George Orwell or other authors. Image suggests globe Earth model represents manufactured deception packaged and delivered to humanity over centuries through educational indoctrination. Implies truth-tellers are dismissed as crazy. Box symbolizes how worldview is pre-packaged commodity sold to consumers rather than discovered through independent investigation. Glowing effect suggests seductive appeal of false narrative5:T5ce,Redditor's Wife meme about flat Earth research obsession. Classic two-panel internet meme format using 'Redditor's Wife' template showing relationship priorities versus online rabbit holes. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'HONEY ARE YOU COMING TO BED?'. Image shows woman with long blonde hair wearing blue pajamas standing behind her partner who sits at computer desk. Woman has concerned, patient expression with hand on hip. Man sits hunched forward intensely focused on computer monitor, face partially visible in profile showing concentration. Entire scene bathed in cool blue tones suggesting late night/early morning. Computer screen glow illuminates man's face. Bottom text: 'AFTER I FIGURE OUT IF THE EARTH IS REALLY FLAT'. Watermark 'JM' in bottom right. Humorous commentary on people becoming consumed by conspiracy theory research, spending excessive time investigating flat Earth claims instead of normal activities like sleep. Relatable format shows partner's frustration with obsessive online behavior. Meme reflects common pattern where individuals discover flat Earth theory and become absorbed in endless YouTube videos, forums, and 'research' trying to determine truth, often at expense of relationships and responsibilities. Blue color palette reinforces late-night internet browsing aesthetic. Template originated from stock photo and became popular for depicting situations where someone prioritizes internet activity over real-world obligations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-256","title":"Other 256","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705521_470168183182921_2282890104449616899_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-255","title":"Other 255","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705408_463496250516781_1766928751739367074_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-257","title":"Other 257","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705553_465968800269526_6465967269783807386_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
