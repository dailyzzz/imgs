5:T706,Two-panel comparison claiming superior mirage versus flat Earth proof. Top panel shows photograph of large industrial ship or offshore platform at sea. Structure appears distorted and elevated above horizon - visible sections include white superstructure, red-brown hull sections, industrial equipment, cranes all appearing to float or hover above water line. Image shows classic superior mirage optical effect where atmospheric refraction causes distant objects to appear lifted, inverted, or distorted when cold air sits below warm air creating temperature gradient. Ship components appear segmented and disjointed. Dark blue ocean water fills lower portion. Light gray-blue sky at top. White text overlay at top reads: 'THIS IS A SUPERIOR MIRAGE'. Bottom panel shows similar ocean scene at sunset or sunrise with dramatic sky. Sky displays gradient from pale yellow-cream near horizon transitioning to peachy-orange, then pink, then deeper blue at top. Horizon line shows distant city skyline or industrial structures as small dark silhouettes against bright sky - visible towers, buildings, possibly lighthouse or communications structures. Ocean shows dark blue water. Center displays large 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text in large white bold letters: 'THIS IS PROOF OF FLAT EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' credit. Lower right credits 'Joshua Nowicki'. Comparison attempts to distinguish between superior mirage (temperature inversion atmospheric refraction) and distant visibility allegedly impossible on curved Earth. However, both phenomena can occur on spherical Earth. Superior mirages are well-documented optical effects. Standard refraction calculations account for atmospheric light bending allowing visibility beyond geometric horizon0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 256 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel comparison claiming superior mirage versus flat Earth proof.
