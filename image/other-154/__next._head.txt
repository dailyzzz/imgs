5:T45e,Whimsical illustrated poem in Shel Silverstein style about flat Earth edge. White background with black ink line drawings. Title at top: 'THE EDGE OF THE WORLD'. Poem text reads: 'Columbus said the world is round? / Don't you believe a word of that. / For I've been down to the edge of the world, / Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled, / Peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls, / And I can tell you, boys and girls, / The world is FLAT!' Illustration shows flat Earth edge scene with various whimsical elements: left side shows city skyline with buildings and church spires, signpost reading 'THE EDGE', floating objects suggesting items falling off edge, running dog or creature, fire hydrant, trash can, figure sitting/peering over edge on right side. Playful sketch style with loose pen strokes. Bottom right: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses children's poetry format to present flat Earth in accessible, non-threatening way. References Columbus myth while claiming first-hand experience of world's edge. Whimsical tone makes controversial topic seem innocent and imaginative rather than confrontational0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 154 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Whimsical illustrated poem in Shel Silverstein style about flat Earth edge.
