3:T45e,Whimsical illustrated poem in Shel Silverstein style about flat Earth edge. White background with black ink line drawings. Title at top: 'THE EDGE OF THE WORLD'. Poem text reads: 'Columbus said the world is round? / Don't you believe a word of that. / For I've been down to the edge of the world, / Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled, / Peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls, / And I can tell you, boys and girls, / The world is FLAT!' Illustration shows flat Earth edge scene with various whimsical elements: left side shows city skyline with buildings and church spires, signpost reading 'THE EDGE', floating objects suggesting items falling off edge, running dog or creature, fire hydrant, trash can, figure sitting/peering over edge on right side. Playful sketch style with loose pen strokes. Bottom right: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses children's poetry format to present flat Earth in accessible, non-threatening way. References Columbus myth while claiming first-hand experience of world's edge. Whimsical tone makes controversial topic seem innocent and imaginative rather than confrontational4:T4b1,Stunning aerial landscape photograph from mountain/elevated viewpoint with flat Earth messaging. Shows dramatic coastal scene - left side features massive layered sedimentary rock cliff face with tan, brown, and gray horizontal strata visible. Mountain extends down slope covered in green vegetation. Right side shows brilliant turquoise-blue ocean water meeting dark coastline with white wave breaks visible along shore. Small coastal town/settlement visible at base of mountain with white buildings clustered together. Ocean extends to perfectly flat horizon line under bright blue sky with scattered white wispy clouds. Sunlight creates beautiful atmospheric perspective. Top text in large white letters with subtle shadow: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. Center text: 'RESEARCH IT!' in white outlined letters. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses spectacular natural beauty to attract attention to flat Earth message. Horizon appears flat in photograph (as it would from any viewpoint regardless of Earth's shape). Encourages viewers to independently investigate rather than accept mainstream narrative. Juxtaposition of beautiful landscape with controversial message creates cognitive dissonance5:T538,Nikola Tesla quote over vintage scientific illustration collage. Black and white image shows complex technical background with geometric patterns, grid systems, scientific instruments, spiral designs. Left side shows figure (possibly Tesla) working at desk with papers/equipment. Center shows large spiral/coil design. Right side displays vintage electrical equipment, light bulb, measuring devices. White text overlay reads: 'Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. Nikola Tesla'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Quote from famous inventor Nikola Tesla criticizes modern theoretical physics for prioritizing mathematical models over empirical observation and experimentation. Applied to flat Earth context, argues mainstream astronomy relies too heavily on abstract mathematics (gravity calculations, orbital mechanics) rather than direct sensory evidence (Earth appears flat, water is level). Suggests Tesla's experimental approach would support flat Earth over globe model. Uses Tesla's authority as legendary inventor/scientist to legitimize questioning mainstream cosmology. Vintage scientific imagery creates association with classical empiricism versus modern abstraction0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-154","title":"Other 154","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12472260_455802364619503_7030039292681837275_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-153","title":"Other 153","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12471743_455240954675644_7637157316831754820_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-155","title":"Other 155","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12473843_454098494789890_4607171506378368323_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
