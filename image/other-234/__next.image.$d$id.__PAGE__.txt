3:T5ce,Dramatic Antarctic ice shelf wall meeting ocean from aerial perspective. Shows breathtaking aerial photograph of Antarctic ice formation from elevated viewpoint looking along ice edge. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates right side and background - perfectly flat white-gray ice surface extending to horizon creating geometric plane. Ice shows subtle surface variations, crevasses, and textural details. Most striking feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets water - clean straight edge running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified layers of compressed ice and snow in white and blue-gray bands. Face shows some irregularities, overhangs, and ice chunks that have calved off. Left side shows dark navy-blue to black ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, small icebergs floating on surface. Two small turquoise-blue ice chunks or small bergs visible in lower left. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast with bright white ice. Sky shows overcast gray-white conditions typical of Antarctic weather. Horizon line in far distance. No text or watermarks visible. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing ocean water from spilling off edges and restricting access to whatever lies beyond Antarctic perimeter4:T5b9,NASA astronaut requirements satirical checklist with spacewalk background. Shows astronaut in white EVA spacesuit performing spacewalk in low Earth orbit. Astronaut's helmet reflects bright sunlight, shows gold-tinted visor, white PLSS (Portable Life Support System) backpack visible. Background shows stunning Earth view from space - curved blue planet with white cloud swirls, turquoise-blue oceans visible. Atmosphere limb glows bright blue at horizon. Dark space visible at top. Upper right shows official NASA logo (blue circle with red chevron, white letters). Foreground displays satirical document titled 'NASA Astronaut Requirements' with three items checked with blue checkmarks: 'Bachelor's degree in a Scuba diving', '33rd degree Freemason', 'Ability to lie'. Upper left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right displays 'JM' signature watermark. Satire suggests NASA astronauts are selected for conspiracy participation rather than scientific credentials. Bachelor's degree in scuba diving mocks underwater training in Neutral Buoyancy Lab where astronauts practice EVA procedures - conspiracy theorists claim spacewalk footage is filmed underwater. 33rd degree Freemason reference suggests occult secret society controls space program. Multiple astronauts have been Freemasons including Buzz Aldrin. 'Ability to lie' explicitly states astronauts are actors perpetuating hoax. Discredits astronaut testimony and space program achievements5:T5f8,Density column experiment with layered liquids and objects demonstrating buoyancy. Shows tall clear glass cylinder or vase containing density tower science experiment against white background. Multiple colored liquids stacked in distinct horizontal layers from bottom to top, separated by surface tension and density differences. Bottom layer: golden-amber honey with small metal bolt resting at bottom. Second layer: tan-beige corn syrup. Third layer: darker brown (appears to be 100% maple syrup). Fourth layer: white opaque milk with popcorn kernel floating at interface. Fifth layer: clear or pale liquid (dish soap). Sixth layer: light blue-green water with red cherry tomato suspended at level. Seventh layer: clear liquid (vegetable oil). Eighth layer: purple-blue liquid (rubbing alcohol) with small plastic beads floating. Ninth layer: bright red liquid (lamp oil). Top: white ping pong ball floating on surface with white plastic soda bottle cap below it. Left side shows black text labels identifying each liquid layer. Right side shows red text labels identifying floating objects at each density level. Demonstrates principle of density and buoyancy - denser materials sink to bottom, less dense materials float on top. Each object floats at layer matching its own density. Flat Earth proponents use this to argue buoyancy and density explain rising/falling without requiring gravity. Claim objects naturally seek their density level in medium rather than being pulled by gravitational force toward planetary center0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-234","title":"Other 234","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669527_461770220689384_4205422869487854845_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-233","title":"Other 233","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669451_460535570812849_7178703130652227552_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-235","title":"Other 235","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670100_463799087153164_5975624137514349673_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
