5:T5ce,Dramatic Antarctic ice shelf wall meeting ocean from aerial perspective. Shows breathtaking aerial photograph of Antarctic ice formation from elevated viewpoint looking along ice edge. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates right side and background - perfectly flat white-gray ice surface extending to horizon creating geometric plane. Ice shows subtle surface variations, crevasses, and textural details. Most striking feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets water - clean straight edge running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified layers of compressed ice and snow in white and blue-gray bands. Face shows some irregularities, overhangs, and ice chunks that have calved off. Left side shows dark navy-blue to black ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, small icebergs floating on surface. Two small turquoise-blue ice chunks or small bergs visible in lower left. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast with bright white ice. Sky shows overcast gray-white conditions typical of Antarctic weather. Horizon line in far distance. No text or watermarks visible. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing ocean water from spilling off edges and restricting access to whatever lies beyond Antarctic perimeter0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 234 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dramatic Antarctic ice shelf wall meeting ocean from aerial perspective.
