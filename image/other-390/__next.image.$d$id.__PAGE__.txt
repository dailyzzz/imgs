3:T1a25,Green screen studio setup with ISS model and film crew, overlaid with NASA "loss of signal" message to mock space agency's technical interruptions as evidence of faked space footage. Flat Earth propaganda image combining behind-the-scenes filmmaking photograph with official NASA text to suggest ISS footage is studio production rather than actual space station coverage. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Satirical composite combining two elements - photograph of green screen film production and overlaid text resembling NASA broadcast messages. IMAGE BACKGROUND - GREEN SCREEN SET: Bright green chroma key background filling most of frame - standard film/video production technique allowing background replacement in post-production. Large professional film studio space visible. Lighting equipment visible on left side - white reflector or diffuser panel on stand. Ladder/scaffolding visible on left - typical studio equipment for reaching high angles. FILM CREW MEMBER: Person visible on right side of frame standing on raised platform/box. Male crew member wearing casual clothes - checkered shirt, dark vest/harness. Arm raised overhead - appears to be adjusting or holding equipment. "JM" marking visible on equipment/box - likely production department identifier. Professional film worker positioning equipment or rigging for shot. ISS MODEL: Central focus of image - detailed model of International Space Station suspended in middle of green screen. Model shows characteristic ISS features: Central truss structure, Multiple solar panel arrays extending from sides, Various modules and components visible, Detailed enough for convincing camera shots, Appears to be high-quality miniature used for visual effects. Model suspended from above by wire/cable visible at top of frame. Standard special effects technique for creating "floating in space" imagery. TEXT OVERLAY: Official-looking text in center reads: "Please stand by. We are either switching cameras, or we are experiencing a temporary loss of signal with the International Space Station." This text mimics genuine NASA TV messages displayed during broadcast interruptions. Text formatted to look like official NASA communication. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible at bottom. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) ISS FAKED IN STUDIO: Image suggests NASA creates ISS footage using models against green screens in film studios. "Loss of signal" messages are allegedly cover for switching between camera angles or fixing production issues - not actual communication problems with real space station. 2) WHY "LOSS OF SIGNAL" HAPPENS: Flat Earthers interpret broadcast interruptions as evidence of fakery: Real space station would have continuous coverage capability. Interruptions occur when "actors" need breaks or set changes are needed. "Technical difficulties" are convenient excuses for editing fake footage together. 3) GREEN SCREEN EVIDENCE: Occasional video artifacts, compression glitches, or hair movement on ISS are cited as "green screen errors" proving studio filming. Any perceived visual anomaly becomes evidence of fakery rather than normal video compression/transmission issues. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) LOSS OF SIGNAL IS REAL: ISS orbits Earth every 90 minutes, passing through zones where communication satellites don't provide coverage. Signal loss occurs when ISS is in "zone of exclusion" between communication satellite coverage areas. Also occurs during orbital maneuvers, antenna repositioning, or actual equipment issues. Loss of signal is predicted, expected, and documented - not suspicious. 2) YOU CAN TRACK ISS YOURSELF: ISS visible to naked eye as it passes overhead - one of brightest objects in night sky. Tracking websites/apps show exact position matching predictions based on orbital mechanics. Amateur astronomers photograph ISS showing solar panels, modules, even docked spacecraft. Ham radio operators communicate directly with ISS astronauts. Anyone can verify ISS exists independently of NASA. 3) MULTIPLE NATIONS INVOLVED: ISS is international project involving NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CSA (Canada). Would require unprecedented international conspiracy among rival nations to maintain fake station. Russia and USA were Cold War enemies - why would they cooperate on decades-long hoax? 4) CONTINUOUS LIVE FEEDS: NASA provides nearly continuous live video from ISS showing Earth rotation, day/night cycles, weather systems - all matching real-time conditions. Live feed shows ISS orbital path matching predicted trajectory. Would require impossibly complex real-time CGI to fake Earth conditions matching actual weather worldwide. 5) PRIVATE COMPANIES NOW VISIT: SpaceX, Boeing have docked spacecraft with ISS. Private astronauts have visited. Would require ever-expanding conspiracy to include private sector. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos would need to be complicit in space hoax while publicly competing for space business. IMAGE SOURCE: Green screen photograph appears to be from legitimate film/TV production - possibly behind-the-scenes from science fiction production, commercial shoot, or documentary recreation. ISS model likely from visual effects work for educational content or entertainment. Flat Earth community combined unrelated filmmaking photo with NASA-style text to create propaganda image suggesting NASA uses similar techniques. Original photo has nothing to do with NASA or ISS - repurposed for conspiracy content. VISUAL RHETORIC: Image is effective because: Shows real film production techniques (green screen, models, lighting). Juxtaposes with NASA-style official text. Creates association between filmmaking and NASA. Invites viewer to conclude: "So THAT'S how they do it!" Format makes claim visually compelling without providing actual evidence NASA uses these techniques. IMAGE LIMITATIONS: 1) Doesn't prove NASA fakes ISS - just shows that green screen technology exists (which everyone knows). 2) Model quality shown is lower than actual ISS footage quality. 3) Modern ISS "exterior" shots are from cameras mounted ON ISS, not models. 4) Ignores massive evidence for real ISS including amateur verification. 5) Conspiracy would require thousands of people across multiple nations maintaining perfect secrecy for decades - implausible. PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUE: Classic "proof by suggestion" - showing filmmaking equipment and ISS-related text creates implied connection without explicit false claim. Viewer draws own conclusion that NASA uses these techniques. Technically image doesn't "lie" - it just creates misleading juxtaposition. Effective for audiences already suspicious of NASA; easily dismissed by anyone familiar with ISS verification methods.4:T17ef,Apollo moon landing photograph with text claiming "proof of faked moon landing in 5 seconds" based on horizon position in astronaut's visor reflection. Moon landing conspiracy theory image analyzing iconic Buzz Aldrin photograph, arguing visible horizon in helmet reflection proves studio filming on small set. IMAGE: Famous Apollo 11 photograph showing astronaut (Buzz Aldrin) in full spacesuit on lunar surface. One of most iconic space photographs ever taken - shows astronaut in white spacesuit standing on gray lunar regolith. ASTRONAUT DETAILS: White EVA spacesuit with American flag patch visible on shoulder. Gold-tinted helmet visor reflects surrounding scene. Spacesuit appears bulky - typical of Apollo-era pressure suits. Gloves visible with astronaut appearing to hold or manipulate equipment. Legs and boots standing on lunar surface. VISOR REFLECTION: Key element flat Earthers focus on - visor shows reflection of lunar landscape, photographer (Neil Armstrong), Lunar Module, and surrounding terrain. Reflection provides wide-angle view of scene from astronaut's perspective. Horizon line visible in reflection showing lunar surface meeting black sky. LUNAR SURFACE: Gray powdery regolith (lunar soil) visible. Footprints and disturbed soil around astronaut. Surface appears rough and dusty as expected for Moon. No atmosphere means no sky coloring - just black space above horizon. HEADER TEXT: "PROOF OF FAKED MOON LANDING IN 5 SECONDS..." - Sensationalist claim promising quick definitive evidence. FOOTER TEXT: "THE 'HORIZON' IS VISIBLE BEHIND HIM AND IN FRONT OF HIM IN HIS VISIOR SHOWING HOW SMALL THE SET WAS. PLUS THE LANDERS SHADOW ALMOST REACHES THE HORIZON!" - Claims simultaneous visibility of horizon proves small set. Also claims Lunar Module shadow length proves artificial lighting/small space. FLAT EARTH/MOON HOAX ARGUMENT: 1) HORIZON TOO CLOSE: If really on Moon, horizon should be much farther away (Moon is 2,159 miles diameter). Visible horizon "proves" they're on small studio set where backdrop is only yards away. 2) REFLECTION SHOWS SET LIMITS: Visor reflection allegedly shows entire "set" with horizon visible all around - "real" lunar surface would extend much farther before curving away. 3) SHADOW LENGTH: Lunar Module's shadow extending "almost to horizon" supposedly proves small set with nearby backdrop, since on real Moon shadows would extend across vast distances before reaching any visible boundary. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) MOON IS SMALLER THAN EARTH: Moon's horizon IS closer than Earth's due to smaller diameter. On Moon, horizon is approximately 1.5 miles away at eye level (vs ~3 miles on Earth). So yes, lunar horizon appears close - that's correct physics, not evidence of studio. 2) WIDE-ANGLE DISTORTION: Gold visor is curved convex reflective surface creating wide-angle/fisheye distortion. This makes horizon appear to wrap around viewer from all sides - normal optical effect of curved reflective surface, not proof of small set. 3) NO ATMOSPHERE: On Moon there's no atmospheric haze to obscure distant features. On Earth, distant objects fade due to atmosphere. On Moon, distant features remain sharp until they curve over horizon. This can make horizon appear closer or more defined than expected based on Earth experience. 4) SHADOW PHYSICS: In vacuum with no atmosphere, shadows are extremely sharp and well-defined. Sun angle during Apollo missions created long shadows. Shadow length depends on sun angle and object height - perfectly explainable through normal physics without invoking studio lighting. 5) MULTIPLE CAMERAS/ANGLES: Apollo missions took thousands of photographs from various angles. Each photo consistent with previous ones, terrain matches orbital photography, laser reflectors left on Moon still used by scientists today. Consistency across all documentation argues against studio filming. 6) INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION: USSR tracked Apollo missions and would have exposed hoax if detected - they had every motivation to embarrass USA during Cold War. China, Japan, India have all independently verified Apollo landing sites with orbital imagery showing equipment, tracks, and disturbance patterns. REFLECTION ANALYSIS: Visor reflection actually shows: Photographer (Neil Armstrong) holding camera. Lunar Module in background. Lunar surface extending to horizon. Equipment and experiments. Scene is CONSISTENT with being on Moon - not evidence against it. Curved visor creates expected wide-angle distortion. SHADOW CLAIMS: Claim about Lunar Module shadow "almost reaching horizon" misunderstands lunar conditions: 1) On Moon, shadows are extremely long due to low sun angle during many EVAs. 2) Horizon is closer on Moon (smaller body). 3) Shadow length is function of sun angle and object height - calculable and consistent with Moon. 4) If in studio with artificial lighting, shadows would show multiple light source artifacts (multiple shadows) - Apollo photos show single consistent sun-angle shadows. SOURCE: This specific image is one of hundreds of Apollo photographs subjected to conspiracy analysis. Every claimed "anomaly" has been thoroughly explained by photography experts, NASA engineers, independent scientists, and even film production professionals who note how difficult such a hoax would be to execute. VISUAL RHETORIC: Image uses authentic NASA photograph but adds misleading text interpretation. Encourages viewer to "see" evidence of fakery in normal photographic elements. Assumes viewers unfamiliar with lunar conditions, wide-angle optics, or Apollo mission details. "5 seconds" claim creates false impression that evidence is obvious/undeniable when it actually requires ignoring scientific explanations. MOON LANDING DENIAL OVERLAP: While flat Earth and moon landing denial are separate conspiracy theories, they often overlap in conspiracy communities. Both require believing NASA lies, government deception, and millions of people maintaining impossible secrets. Flat Earthers typically also believe Moon is not solid sphere but luminous disk, making Moon landings impossible by definition in their worldview.5:T1b22,Four-panel collage showing tall buildings and antenna towers asking "What if satellites are really ground based?" Flat Earth meme suggesting all communications attributed to satellites actually come from ground-based infrastructure like cell towers, skyscrapers, and transmission antennas. IMAGE LAYOUT: Four photographs arranged in 2x2 grid showing various tall structures with telecommunications equipment on top. TOP LEFT PANEL: Burj Khalifa in Dubai - world's tallest building (828m/2,717ft). Distinctive tapered spire design visible. Silver/gray metallic exterior reflecting sunlight. Communication antenna visible at top of spire. Building extends dramatically upward against blue sky with scattered clouds. City skyline visible in background. TOP RIGHT PANEL: One World Trade Center in New York City (Freedom Tower). Distinctive angular glass facade reflecting blue sky. Communication spire/antenna at top. Modern skyscraper architecture against blue sky with white clouds. Upper portion of building visible showing glass curtain wall construction. BOTTOM LEFT PANEL: Person (appears to be urban explorer/photographer) sitting on top of extremely tall structure - possibly skyscraper or industrial tower. Urban cityscape visible far below creating dramatic height perspective. Person casually sitting on edge demonstrating extreme altitude. City extends to horizon in all directions. Dusty/hazy atmospheric conditions. Middle Eastern city based on architecture - possibly Dubai. BOTTOM RIGHT PANEL: Rooftop cellular/telecommunications installation on commercial building. Multiple antenna arrays visible - various shapes and configurations. Cylindrical antennas and panel arrays typical of cell tower equipment. Building rooftop with HVAC equipment and antenna mounting structures. Urban setting with other buildings visible in background. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text (white Impact font): "WHAT IF SATELLITES" - Sets up provocative question. Bottom text (white Impact font): "ARE REALLY GROUND BASED?" - Completes question suggesting satellites don't exist and ground infrastructure does their job. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible in bottom left. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SATELLITES DON'T EXIST: In flat Earth model, space is fake and satellites cannot exist. All communications, GPS, TV, internet attributed to "satellites" actually come from ground-based infrastructure. 2) TOWERS DO THE WORK: Tall buildings and transmission towers provide line-of-sight coverage. Network of ground stations connected by cables and relays explains all "satellite" services. Cell towers, radio towers, undersea cables handle all communications without need for orbital infrastructure. 3) GPS FROM GROUND: GPS supposedly works through triangulation from ground towers, not orbital satellites. Military LORAN system (ground-based) proves ground navigation is possible. "Satellite" GPS is just rebranded ground system. 4) HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: Image suggests truth is obvious - look at all these towers and antennas! Why so much ground infrastructure if satellites do the work? Answer: Satellites don't exist; towers are the real system. TECHNICAL REALITY: 1) DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES: Just like with broadcast towers, satellites and ground infrastructure serve complementary purposes - not competing ones. Cell towers: Short-range local coverage. Fiber optic cables: Long-distance high-bandwidth connections. Radio towers: Local broadcast transmission. Satellites: Global coverage, GPS, weather, remote area communication. All are needed because each excels at different applications. 2) GPS REQUIRES SATELLITES: GPS mathematically requires multiple simultaneous signals from known positions to triangulate location. Ground-based systems cannot provide global coverage - Earth's curvature blocks line-of-sight from ground stations beyond horizon. LORAN (ground-based) had limited range and accuracy compared to satellite GPS. GPS satellites orbit at 20,200 km altitude - visible from large portions of Earth simultaneously. 3) SATELLITE TV DISHES PROVE SATELLITES: Satellite TV dishes point at specific positions in sky - geostationary satellites at ~35,786 km altitude. Dishes must be precisely aimed at correct satellite position. Position changes by location on Earth - different aiming for different latitudes/longitudes. If signals came from ground towers, dishes would point at horizon, not sky. You can verify satellite positions with tracking apps and see dishes worldwide pointing at same orbital slots. 4) AMATEUR RADIO SATELLITE CONTACTS: Ham radio operators bounce signals off satellites routinely. Track satellite passes and make contacts during brief overhead windows. Timing matches orbital predictions exactly - satellites move across sky in predictable paths. Anyone with amateur radio license can verify satellites exist through direct personal experience. 5) VISUAL SATELLITE TRACKING: ISS visible to naked eye crossing night sky. Hundreds of satellites visible with binoculars. Starlink satellite trains visible as strings of lights crossing sky. Movement matches predicted orbital paths precisely. You can predict when satellites will be visible and watch them pass exactly as calculated. GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSE: Images show legitimate ground infrastructure that DOES handle much communication: Burj Khalifa: Has cellular antennas for local coverage - building's occupants and nearby area. One World Trade Center: Broadcasting antennas serve local TV/radio - not replacing satellites. Rooftop antennas: Cell tower serving few-mile radius - cannot reach satellites' global coverage. These exist BECAUSE satellites cannot provide localized cellular service effectively. Different tools for different jobs. FALSE DICHOTOMY: Meme presents false either/or choice: Either satellites exist OR ground infrastructure exists. Reality: Both exist, serving different complementary purposes. Ground infrastructure's existence doesn't disprove satellites any more than existence of roads disproves airplanes. VISUAL RHETORIC: Impressive tall buildings and dramatic heights create engaging imagery. Tower-top antennas visible in all photos (even if serving different purposes). Question format invites viewer to "discover" hidden truth. Assumes viewer doesn't understand telecommunications infrastructure. Works for audiences already primed to distrust official explanations. WEAKNESS: Anyone in telecommunications industry immediately recognizes different equipment types serving different purposes. Satellite dishes visible on same buildings point at sky, not ground towers. Personal experience with GPS, satellite TV, satellite internet contradicts "ground-based" claim. Images don't show evidence satellites are fake - just show ground infrastructure exists (which nobody disputes). False premise: Nobody claims ground infrastructure doesn't exist - question is whether satellites ALSO exist (which they demonstrably do).0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-390","title":"Other 390","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12967453_489106497955756_1709119393798707059_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-389","title":"Other 389","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12963819_485550064978066_8752543967666575158_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-391","title":"Other 391","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12967556_486258038240602_8871969624288831214_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
