5:T570,Historical quote meme showing Wernher von Braun standing in front of Saturn V rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Black and white photograph with von Braun in white shirt and dark tie, massive white rocket behind him with launch tower visible, bird flying across sky. Right side shows extended quote in white text on black background: '"It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the Earth to the Moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the Earth's gravity and, having traveled all the way to the Moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to Earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three ... each rocket ship would be taller than New York's Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons." -Wernher von Braun, the father of the Apollo space program, writing in Conquest of the Moon, 1953.' Presents von Braun's 1953 technical assessment (written 16 years before Apollo 11) as contradiction of actual Apollo missions, suggesting moon landings impossible given his earlier engineering calculations about vehicle requirements.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Moon 3 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical quote meme showing Wernher von Braun standing in front of Saturn V rocket at Kennedy Space Center.
