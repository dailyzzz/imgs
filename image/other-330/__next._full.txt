13:T923,Satirical photoshopped meme showing Barack Obama seated at Resolute Desk in Oval Office with comically oversized pear-shaped Earth globe positioned prominently on desk beside him. President Obama appears to be signing document in blue folder while large distorted globe dominates right side of frame. Text at bottom reads "EXECUTIVE ORDER #109779 I HEREBY PRONOUNCE THE EARTH TO BE PEAR SHAPED SIGNED - BARACK OBAMA". Image mocks scientific statement made by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (meaning it bulges at equator due to rotation) and specifically that it's "pear-shaped" in sense that Southern Hemisphere is slightly wider than Northern Hemisphere - difference of approximately 0.3%. Meme takes Tyson's technically accurate but easily misunderstood description and exaggerates it to absurd proportion, showing globe that's dramatically pear-shaped like fruit rather than subtle oblate spheroid. This is common flat Earth argument strategy: take nuanced scientific statement about Earth's imperfect sphericity (equatorial diameter 7,926 miles vs polar diameter 7,900 miles - difference of only 26 miles or 0.3%) and portray it as admission that globe Earth model is inconsistent or constantly changing. Reality: Earth is indeed not perfect sphere - it's oblate spheroid due to centrifugal force from rotation causing equatorial bulge, and there are additional minor irregularities in shape due to variations in gravitational field and mass distribution. Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment referred to fact that equatorial bulge is slightly larger in Southern Hemisphere than Northern (difference measured in meters, not miles), making Earth very slightly asymmetric. This is measured precisely by satellites using laser altimetry and confirmed by gravitational measurements. Photoshopped globe in image is obviously exaggerated parody - actual Earth's deviation from perfect sphere is less than 0.35%, imperceptible to naked eye from space. Authentic Oval Office setting includes presidential seal on chair back, American flag, windows with gold drapes visible in background, red leather chair, wooden desk with papers. Attribution: "fb.com/fematters" watermark at bottom. Meme conflates "not perfectly spherical" with "not spherical at all" - logical fallacy common in flat Earth argumentation.14:T927,Motivational meme showing mountain climber silhouette standing atop rocky mountain peak with dramatic cloud layer below and blue sky above. Text at top reads "THOSE WHO HAVE EYES DO NOT BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT" and bottom text states "THEY SEE IT". Image presents classic flat Earth argument that from high altitudes (mountains, airplanes), observers can see horizon appears flat rather than curved, suggesting this visual evidence contradicts spherical Earth model. Stunning landscape photograph features lone hiker positioned on snowy/rocky summit with sea of white clouds stretching to horizon below, bright sun creating lens flare in upper portion of frame, creating dramatic perspective that emphasizes vast horizontal plane of cloud layer. Argument relies on limited human perspective and scale - Earth's curvature becomes visible only at much higher altitudes (typically above 35,000 feet or from spacecraft), and from mountaintop elevations (even 20,000+ feet), curvature is extremely subtle due to Earth's large size (7,917 mile diameter means curvature drops only about 8 inches per mile squared). What observers interpret as "flat" horizon is actually limitation of human visual system combined with atmospheric effects and fact that from any ground-based vantage point, observer is viewing tiny fraction of Earth's total surface. Commercial airline passengers at cruising altitude (35,000-40,000 feet) can observe slight curvature when looking at horizon, though effect is subtle. High-altitude balloon footage and images from International Space Station clearly show Earth's curvature. Meme employs "seeing is believing" rhetoric to suggest direct observation trumps scientific measurements and calculations, but fails to account for limitations of human perception at planetary scales. Cloud layer in image creates particularly deceptive effect, as uniform horizontal plane of clouds reinforces impression of flatness, even though clouds themselves follow Earth's curvature. Scientific rebuttal: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles; from typical mountain summit (10,000-15,000 feet altitude), horizon distance extends only 120-150 miles, representing less than 0.5% of Earth's circumference - far too small a sample to visually detect overall curvature. Attribution watermark: "fb.com/fematters" in bottom right corner.15:Tad1,Bowling alley photograph showing tall vertical stack of colorful bowling balls balanced precariously on white surface with man in dark polo shirt and khaki shorts standing with arms crossed in background. Text overlay at top states "SUPPOSEDLY SPINNING 1000 MPH" and bottom text declares "YET IS COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS". Sign visible behind bowling balls reads "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" (parody of Black Lives Matter movement). Stack consists of approximately 9-10 bowling balls in various colors: blue, orange, purple, green, dark green, yellow, orange, green, dark blue/purple, red arranged vertically from bottom to top. Interior bowling alley setting shows typical features: drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting panels, pool table rules sign partially visible on wall ("No sitting on..." text fragment visible), tables and chairs, TV screen mounted on wall in background, casual recreational facility environment. Image presents classic flat Earth argument that if Earth were truly rotating at approximately 1,000 mph at equator (actual equatorial rotation speed is 1,037 mph, decreasing toward poles), we should feel this motion, and objects would be unable to remain balanced or stationary. Argument fundamentally misunderstands basic physics principle of inertial reference frames and constant velocity motion. Scientific rebuttal: Bowling balls, building, and all objects on Earth share same rotational velocity, moving together with Earth's surface - there is no relative motion between objects and ground. This is identical to why airplane passengers can walk normally in cabin of jet traveling 500+ mph - everything inside plane shares plane's velocity. Motion is only perceptible when there is acceleration (change in speed or direction). Earth's rotation is constant velocity motion (one rotation per 24 hours), so there is no acceleration felt by objects on surface. Additionally, while equatorial rotation speed is ~1,000 mph, this represents only one rotation per day - incredibly slow angular velocity (0.0007 rpm). For comparison, Earth's orbital velocity around sun is 67,000 mph, and solar system moves through galaxy at 514,000 mph, yet we perceive none of these motions because they're constant velocity. Bowling balls remain stacked because gravity (9.8 m/s² downward acceleration) holds them in place relative to Earth's surface, and all objects share Earth's rotational momentum. Centrifugal force from Earth's rotation is real but minuscule compared to gravity - only about 0.3% of gravitational force at equator, already factored into what we measure as "gravity." Image exemplifies fundamental misunderstanding: conflating high velocity with perceptibility, ignoring that constant motion is imperceptible in absence of external reference frame.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-330","title":"Other 330","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12798942_469408643258875_6491435334159942430_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-329","title":"Other 329","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12798931_470593886473684_3704752133026437014_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-331","title":"Other 331","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799328_468744459991960_7273001810409829341_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
