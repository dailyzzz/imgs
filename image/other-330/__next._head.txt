5:T923,Satirical photoshopped meme showing Barack Obama seated at Resolute Desk in Oval Office with comically oversized pear-shaped Earth globe positioned prominently on desk beside him. President Obama appears to be signing document in blue folder while large distorted globe dominates right side of frame. Text at bottom reads "EXECUTIVE ORDER #109779 I HEREBY PRONOUNCE THE EARTH TO BE PEAR SHAPED SIGNED - BARACK OBAMA". Image mocks scientific statement made by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (meaning it bulges at equator due to rotation) and specifically that it's "pear-shaped" in sense that Southern Hemisphere is slightly wider than Northern Hemisphere - difference of approximately 0.3%. Meme takes Tyson's technically accurate but easily misunderstood description and exaggerates it to absurd proportion, showing globe that's dramatically pear-shaped like fruit rather than subtle oblate spheroid. This is common flat Earth argument strategy: take nuanced scientific statement about Earth's imperfect sphericity (equatorial diameter 7,926 miles vs polar diameter 7,900 miles - difference of only 26 miles or 0.3%) and portray it as admission that globe Earth model is inconsistent or constantly changing. Reality: Earth is indeed not perfect sphere - it's oblate spheroid due to centrifugal force from rotation causing equatorial bulge, and there are additional minor irregularities in shape due to variations in gravitational field and mass distribution. Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment referred to fact that equatorial bulge is slightly larger in Southern Hemisphere than Northern (difference measured in meters, not miles), making Earth very slightly asymmetric. This is measured precisely by satellites using laser altimetry and confirmed by gravitational measurements. Photoshopped globe in image is obviously exaggerated parody - actual Earth's deviation from perfect sphere is less than 0.35%, imperceptible to naked eye from space. Authentic Oval Office setting includes presidential seal on chair back, American flag, windows with gold drapes visible in background, red leather chair, wooden desk with papers. Attribution: "fb.com/fematters" watermark at bottom. Meme conflates "not perfectly spherical" with "not spherical at all" - logical fallacy common in flat Earth argumentation.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 330 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Satirical photoshopped meme showing Barack Obama seated at Resolute Desk in Oval Office with comically oversized pear-shaped Earth globe positioned prominent..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 330"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Satirical photoshopped meme showing Barack Obama seated at Resolute Desk in Oval Office with comically oversized pear-shaped Earth globe positioned prominent..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12798942_469408643258875_6491435334159942430_n.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
