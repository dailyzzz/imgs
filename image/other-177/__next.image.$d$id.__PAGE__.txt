3:T47e,Universal Pictures logo parody reading 'UNIVERSAL LIE'. Black starry space background with blue nebula clouds. Center shows illuminated spherical globe Earth with city lights visible on night side, blue oceans and green-brown continents on day side. Bright white-yellow sun rising behind Earth creating lens flare and atmospheric glow. Large white metallic 3D text with chrome/silver effect reads 'UNIVERSAL LIE' in Universal Pictures studio logo font style, with trademark circle-R symbol. Text arcs above and around Earth mimicking iconic movie studio opening. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in semi-transparent text. Parodies Universal Pictures' famous logo/intro showing spinning globe with company name. Replaces 'Universal' with 'Universal Lie' to suggest globe Earth model is worldwide deception perpetuated by media/Hollywood. Implies entertainment industry complicit in maintaining heliocentric lie through constant subliminal messaging. Uses familiar cinematic branding to make point that movies/TV condition masses to accept spherical Earth without question. Argues Hollywood serves as propaganda arm for globe Earth narrative4:T4ab,Freemason 666 numerology meme connecting Earth measurements. Dark red gradient background with black water reflection effect. Top banner in distressed red text: 'FREEMASON SCIENCE'. White text states: 'Earth revolves around the sun at:' followed by large yellow numbers '66,600 mph'. Next line: 'Curvature of one square mile:' with yellow numbers '.666 ft.' with small degree symbol. Bottom section shows 'Earth tilts at:' with large yellow '66.6°'. Right side displays CGI globe Earth partially submerged in dark red water showing Africa, Europe, Mediterranean visible in green/tan/blue. Bottom text in distressed red: 'STILL THINK IT'S ALL A COINCIDENCE?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in bottom right. Conspiracy theory connects repeating 666 pattern (number of the beast from Revelation) in Earth's orbital speed, curvature calculation, and axial tilt. Implies Freemasons designed heliocentric model using occult numerology rather than empirical measurements. Argues these suspiciously similar numbers prove globe Earth is Satanic deception. Uses apocalyptic imagery (blood-red sky/water, sinking Earth) to create ominous atmosphere. Suggests mainstream astronomy encodes hidden occult knowledge5:T497,Office Space meme mocking pear-shaped Earth explanation. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) in iconic scene from 1999 comedy. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, red suspenders, yellow tie with animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug, has condescending smirk expression. Blurred office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, beige walls. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'IF NASA COULD SHOW ME THAT PEAR SHAPED OBLATE SPHEROID'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'TrueEarthFlatEarth'. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate speak ('that would be great') to mock NASA's pear-shaped Earth claims. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is oblate spheroid (slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator) which he described as 'pear-shaped' causing controversy. Flat Earth proponents seized on this as admission Earth photos don't match actual shape, demanding to see actual pear-shaped Earth. Meme's sarcastic tone suggests NASA cannot produce such image because it doesn't exist. Uses office comedy context to portray NASA as incompetent bureaucracy making excuses0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-177","title":"Other 177","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512544_462324730633933_6184343257982206791_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-176","title":"Other 176","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512420_483466411853098_1470728874970540080_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-178","title":"Other 178","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512672_483382441861495_7999342294974040002_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
