13:T131f,Anthropomorphized globe Earth graduation meme rejecting re-education about spherical Earth. 3D rendered cartoon image showing globe Earth character as frustrated graduate tired of being lectured about spherical Earth model. Center of frame shows computer-generated Earth globe given humanoid characteristics - spherical body showing realistic satellite photography of Earth's surface with blue oceans (navy blue), green landmasses (North America visible on left, South America below, Europe and Africa on right side), white cloud formations swirling across surface creating realistic weather patterns. Earth rendered with accurate geography and cloud textures. Globe has cartoon limbs attached: two blue arms extending from sides, two blue legs extending from bottom, all rendered in solid navy blue color suggesting ocean water as material. Arms and legs show simple cartoon styling - cylindrical shapes with rounded joints suggesting elbows/knees, ending in mitten-like hands and simple feet. Limbs positioned to suggest body language: left arm raised holding diploma scroll, right arm hanging down, legs standing in neutral stance on invisible ground. Entire figure appears as Earth standing upright as character. Atop Earth sits black graduation cap (mortarboard) - traditional square academic cap with flat board on top and tassel hanging from right side. Cap positioned as if sitting on "head" (North Pole area). Cap signifies educational achievement/graduation. Right hand/arm holds rolled diploma/degree - white cylindrical scroll tied with red ribbon band marked "JM" in white letters (possibly initials, could reference creator or be generic decoration). Diploma signifies completion of education program. Background shows white space with light blue watermark diagonally across lower left reading "fb.com/fematters" in semi-transparent text. Figure casts soft shadow below suggesting three-dimensional rendering with lighting from above/front. Text overlays in large bold white letters with thick black outlines for readability: top text spanning image width reads "EVERY FLAT EARTHER USED TO BELIEVE THEY WERE ON A GLOBE" - acknowledging flat Earth believers' past acceptance of mainstream education. Bottom text reads "STOP TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO US AGAIN" - exasperated request to cease re-education attempts. Meme addresses common interaction between flat Earth believers and mainstream individuals: globe believers often attempt to "educate" flat Earthers by explaining basic astronomy, physics, evidence for spherical Earth. Flat Earthers find this patronizing because they already learned globe Earth model in school (represented by graduation cap and diploma). Message: "We're not ignorant of your model - we learned it, graduated with it, but have since rejected it based on our own research. Stop treating us like we simply don't understand the globe model - we understand it, we just believe it's wrong." Graduation imagery emphasizes: 1) Flat Earthers are educated people who completed standard schooling, 2) They're not lacking knowledge of globe Earth theory, 3) Their rejection comes AFTER learning mainstream view, not from ignorance, 4) They feel condescended to when people re-explain concepts they already know. Frustrated anthropomorphized Earth character represents flat Earthers' perspective: they see themselves as Earth holding diploma in "globe Earth education" but having moved beyond that framework to "truth" of flat Earth. Irony: image uses globe Earth rendering to represent flat Earthers' former belief, making visual joke work through contrast. Psychological pattern common in conspiracy communities: believers often describe awakening journey from accepting mainstream narrative to questioning and eventually rejecting it. Frame themselves as more educated than average person because they've learned both perspectives (mainstream + alternative) while critics only know mainstream. "Do your own research" ethos positions them as independent thinkers versus "indoctrinated" masses. However, scientific literacy involves more than knowing claims exist - requires understanding scientific method, evaluating evidence quality, distinguishing between tested theories and speculation. Flat Earthers typically misunderstand physics principles they claim to have "researched" - gravity, perspective, scale, inertial reference frames. Educational background in mainstream sense (graduation) doesn't guarantee scientific literacy or critical thinking skills. Many with formal education still fall for logical fallacies, confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect. Meme effective in flat Earth communities because validates feeling of being dismissed or patronized. Creates in-group solidarity: "They don't understand that WE understand THEM, but they don't understand US." Positions movement as intellectually sophisticated rather than scientifically illiterate.14:T1328,Grand Canyon photograph mocking Mars landing authenticity by showing Earth landscape resembling Mars. Humorous conspiracy meme suggesting Grand Canyon used to fake Mars missions. Image shows spectacular Grand Canyon vista during golden hour lighting. Left and center portions display massive layered rock formations characteristic of Grand Canyon - steep canyon walls showing horizontal stratification in warm earth tones: reds, oranges, browns, tans, purples creating distinct bands representing different geological periods. Canyon depth creates dramatic vertical relief with multiple levels of cliffs, plateaus, and ridges receding into distance. Atmospheric perspective makes distant formations appear hazier and more purple-blue. Right foreground shows lighter colored rocky promontory or overlook where photograph was taken. Standing on this overlook edge is tourist/hiker - man in casual clothing (dark t-shirt, shorts, backpack) with beard, standing in profile facing left toward canyon view. Man positioned at cliff edge taking in vista, typical tourist pose at Grand Canyon scenic overlook. To man's right (viewer's right side) stand two wild animals - appear to be bighorn sheep or Rocky Mountain goats with light tan/white fur coats, distinctive stocky bodies adapted for mountain terrain. Animals positioned on rocks near cliff edge, one appears to be looking toward camera/viewer. Animals' presence adds unexpected wildlife element to tourist photo. Foreground shows tan sandstone or limestone rock surface with desert vegetation - small green shrubs or bushes growing from cracks in rocks. Lighting suggests late afternoon or early evening - warm golden-orange light illuminating canyon walls from low sun angle, creating dramatic shadows and highlights emphasizing geological textures. Sky visible in background shows overcast conditions - gray-white clouds suggesting possible sunset or sunrise atmospheric conditions. Text overlays in large bold white letters with black outline: top text reads "WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ENJOY THE GRAND CANYON" setting up joke scenario. Bottom text delivers punchline: "BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO FAKE THE MARS LANDING" with "fb.com/fematters" attribution on left. Meme's humor/conspiracy theory suggestion: Grand Canyon's landscape (red rocks, layered sediments, barren terrain, dramatic geological features) bears striking resemblance to Mars surface as seen in Mars rover photographs and orbiter imagery. Conspiracy theory implies: instead of sending rovers/landers to Mars, NASA uses Earth locations (particularly Grand Canyon, Arizona/Utah deserts, volcanic landscapes) to film "Mars missions" while claiming footage comes from Mars. Animals (bighorn sheep) in frame serve double purpose: 1) Unexpected photobomb creating humor in otherwise scenic shot, 2) Represents "they" in caption - animals as stand-ins for NASA/government "trying to fake Mars landing" by using this convincing Mars-like landscape. Absurdist humor suggests even animals are in on conspiracy. Context: Mars landing hoax theory less common than moon landing hoax theory but exists in conspiracy communities. Arguments include: 1) Delays in transmission allegedly artificial, 2) Lighting in Mars photos looks like Earth, 3) Certain rocks/landscapes resemble Earth locations, 4) Technical difficulties make Mars missions "too hard" to be real. However, extensive evidence confirms Mars missions: 1) Multiple nations operate Mars missions (USA, Russia, ESA, India, China, UAE) - international competition makes hoax impossible, 2) Mars satellites photograph rovers on surface matching claimed positions, 3) Scientific data returned includes atmospheric composition, mineralogy unique to Mars, 4) Curiosity rover's self-portrait shows dust on camera lens accumulated over time - impossible to fake, 5) Amateur radio operators track signals from Mars during missions. Grand Canyon comparison has superficial validity - both show layered sedimentary rocks, arid conditions, red iron oxide coloring. However, Mars has distinct features: different mineralogy, atmospheric conditions (thin CO2 atmosphere, pink sky), different gravity affecting erosion patterns, ancient lakebeds, polar ice caps of dry ice and water ice. Scientific instruments can distinguish Mars rocks from Earth rocks through isotope ratios, mineral composition, weathering patterns. Grand Canyon formed by Colorado River erosion over 5-6 million years through rocks up to 2 billion years old. Mars canyons (like Valles Marineris - 4,000 km long, 7 km deep) formed by different geological processes including tectonic activity and ancient water flow. Meme exploits visual similarity while ignoring scientific distinctions. Popular format in conspiracy communities juxtaposing mundane Earth location with extraordinary space claim, suggesting simple explanation (faking) versus complex reality (interplanetary exploration).15:T1362,Leonardo DiCaprio meme holding blank "proof list" suggesting no evidence exists for globe Earth. Photograph of actor Leonardo DiCaprio at formal event modified with text overlay to mock evidence for spherical Earth. DiCaprio stands in professional setting facing camera in three-quarter view, body slightly angled left, head turned toward camera with serious contemplative expression. He wears formal attire: black suit jacket, white dress shirt with collar open (no tie), creating semi-formal appearance. Dark blonde hair styled back in signature swept style. Facial hair shows light beard and mustache. Age appears late 30s to early 40s (photo likely from 2010s). Hands positioned holding large rectangular white paper/poster board at chest level - paper approximately 18"x24" size held portrait orientation. Background shows official/diplomatic setting: dark purple-blue backdrop with visible UN (United Nations) flag on right side - light blue flag showing UN emblem (world map surrounded by olive branches). Purple-blue curtains/drapes frame scene suggesting press conference or official UN event. Professional lighting illuminates subject evenly. DiCaprio is prominent climate change activist and UN Messenger of Peace, frequently speaks at UN climate conferences, making this appear to be authentic UN appearance photograph. White paper/board DiCaprio holds contains text in black sans-serif font centered near top: "HERE IS A LIST OF PROOFS FOR THE GLOBE" - title suggests comprehensive evidence catalog will follow. However, rest of paper is COMPLETELY BLANK - intentionally empty white space occupying ~80% of visible paper. Blank space is the joke's punchline: alleged "list of proofs" contains nothing, suggesting zero valid evidence exists for spherical Earth. Lower left corner shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme format uses blank list/empty page template to suggest something widely accepted has no supporting evidence - common rhetorical device in conspiracy communities. Applied to flat Earth specifically: mainstream claims Earth is sphere but supposedly cannot provide proof, leaving list empty. Intended message: despite widespread acceptance, scientific establishment has no actual evidence for globe Earth model. All supposed "proofs" are either misinterpreted observations, assumptions, or lies. Blank paper represents absence of genuine evidence. Using DiCaprio is strategic choice: 1) Celebrity known for passionate advocacy of scientific consensus on climate change, 2) Frequently appears at UN representing scientific community's positions, 3) His serious expression and formal setting add gravitas to joke, 4) Creates ironic contrast - voice of scientific establishment holding proof list with nothing on it. However, meme's premise is demonstrably false. Evidence for spherical Earth is extensive, ancient, and directly observable: 1) Ships disappear hull-first over horizon (visible to anyone at coast with binoculars), 2) Different star constellations visible from different hemispheres (try seeing Southern Cross from Canada), 3) Time zones exist because Earth rotates (sun can't be overhead everywhere simultaneously on flat plane), 4) Lunar eclipses show round Earth shadow on moon (only sphere casts round shadow from all angles), 5) Circumnavigation possible - travel continuously east or west and return to start, 6) Satellite imagery from multiple nations showing spherical Earth, 7) Photos from ISS (visible to naked eye crossing sky), 8) Gravity measurements consistent with spherical mass distribution, 9) Foucault pendulum demonstrates Earth's rotation, 10) Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns, ocean currents, 11) Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference in 240 BCE using stick shadows at different latitudes, 12) Modern GPS requires accounting for Earth's curvature - wouldn't work on flat plane, 13) Airplane flight paths and times make sense on globe but not flat map, 14) Seasons caused by Earth's axial tilt relative to sun, 15) Antarctic expeditions by multiple nations confirming continent isn't ice wall, 16) Amateur high-altitude balloon launches showing curvature at 100,000+ feet, 17) Horizon dip angle increases with altitude predictably for sphere. Evidence is not only abundant but replicable - anyone can personally verify many observations. Scientific consensus isn't maintained by absence of evidence but by overwhelming consistency of observations across all fields: astronomy, navigation, physics, geology, meteorology. Blank paper represents not absence of evidence, but flat Earthers' refusal to accept evidence. Psychological phenomenon: when beliefs are identity-based rather than evidence-based, contrary evidence gets dismissed or reinterpreted. Blank list meme allows believers to feel intellectually superior - "mainstream has nothing" - while avoiding engagement with actual extensive evidence. Format is rhetorical propaganda rather than logical argument.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-347","title":"Other 347","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12805899_472789329587473_298723809762868996_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-346","title":"Other 346","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12804817_471665529699853_2384220487193647705_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-348","title":"Other 348","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12805916_471298773069862_3171689689267286590_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
