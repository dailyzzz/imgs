3:T5d2,Airplane window view of snowy landscape with flat horizon questioning denial of senses. Shows photograph taken from commercial aircraft window seat at cruising altitude (approximately 30,000-40,000 feet). View looks down and outward at winter landscape below. Lower half displays terrain with snow-covered ground creating white patches interspersed with darker forested or bare ground areas creating mottled brown-gray-white pattern. Shows valleys, hills, possible river systems creating meandering patterns through landscape. Geographic features suggest mountainous or hilly region with snow accumulation in valleys and on peaks. Upper half shows sky - gradient from darker blue at top transitioning to lighter blue-gray near horizon. Thin white cloud layer visible at middle distance. Most significant feature: horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight where land meets sky, extending across entire width of image at approximately eye level. No visible curvature despite high altitude vantage point. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark in light blue translucent text. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE'. Bottom text: 'TO DENY YOUR OWN SENSES?' Flat Earth argument emphasizes trusting direct sensory observation over scientific authority. Claims if Earth were truly spherical, curvature should be observable from airplane altitude, but horizon appears flat validating personal empirical evidence over theoretical models4:T5f7,Lake Pontchartrain Causeway aerial view claiming missing curvature over 23.87 miles. Shows aerial photograph of Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana from high altitude. Image captured from aircraft looking down at bridge stretching diagonally across frame from upper left to lower right. Bridge appears as two parallel white-gray concrete roadways with yellow center line markings running perfectly straight across water. Structure extends to horizon creating geometric line bisecting image. Left side and upper portion shows land or developed shoreline area - tan-brown urban/suburban development visible with roads, buildings, structures creating textured landscape meeting water's edge. Right side and lower portion shows Lake Pontchartrain water in light turquoise-blue color extending to horizon. Water surface appears smooth with slight texture. Sky shows light blue gradient with white clouds. Bridge appears absolutely straight with no visible curve despite 23+ mile length. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN CAUSEWAY METAIRIE, LA'. Center displays translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in white bold letters: '23.87 MILES LONG 380 FEET OF MISSING CURVATURE'. Flat Earth argument calculates using 8 inches per mile squared formula: at 23.87 miles, Earth's curvature should create 380 foot drop requiring bridge to arc upward to compensate, but bridge appears straight. Mainstream explanation: camera angle and atmospheric refraction affect perception5:T5fc,Density and buoyancy diagram explaining floating objects without gravity. Shows educational physics diagram on black background with light blue fluid section at bottom. Illustrates scientific principle of buoyancy as alternative to gravitational explanation. Top section (black) shows large gray downward-pointing arrow labeled 'Density' at top. Left side displays 'm subscript object' in yellow/orange text with notation '(mass of the object)' below in orange. Yellow-orange dashed rectangle frames spherical object in center. Sphere shown in tan-beige-brown gradient showing three-dimensional shading. Sphere labeled 'ρ subscript object' with notation '(density of the object)' in gray. Sphere partially submerged at interface between black top section and light blue bottom section representing fluid. Bottom section (light blue) represents fluid medium. Lower left shows 'ρ subscript fluid' in black text with notation '(density of the fluid)' below. Bottom center displays large light blue upward-pointing arrow labeled 'Buoyancy' in white text at bottom. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in light gray. Diagram demonstrates Archimedes principle: object floats or sinks based on density relationship between object and surrounding fluid. Flat Earth proponents argue this explains rising/falling without requiring gravity - objects simply seek their natural density level in medium. Claims hot air balloons rise because hot air is less dense than cold air, not because they overcome gravitational force0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-251","title":"Other 251","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698463_461734087359664_377936747346123944_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-250","title":"Other 250","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698459_462795033920236_8668119608642346417_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-252","title":"Other 252","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698648_463798983819841_2655086343656313495_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
