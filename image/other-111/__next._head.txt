Top text reads 'IMAGINE IF YOU WILL' in white bold letters (Serling's signature phrase). Bottom text states 'A WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE LIVING UPSIDE DOWN ON A SPINNING BALL'. Top right watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Uses Twilight Zone format to present spherical Earth concept as absurd science fiction premise worthy of anthology series about bizarre alternate realities. Suggests living on spinning globe is as fantastical as Twilight Zone episodes. Employs Serling's authoritative narration style and show's reputation for mind-bending scenarios to frame heliocentric model as implausible fiction rather than reality"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Other 111"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Twilight Zone meme featuring Rod Serling in classic black and white portrait photograph.
