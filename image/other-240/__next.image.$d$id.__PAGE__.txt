3:T629,Historical text excerpt claiming globe Earth as recent innovation. Shows photograph of aged printed page with tan-beige paper showing brown staining, wear, and aging. Text appears in traditional serif typeface suggesting old book or document. Visible header reads 'preparation for' followed by 'THE GLOBES' as section title. Main paragraph text states: 'A short time ago one of the Brethren questioned the adaptation of the balls to use for globes representing the terrestrial and celestial firmaments. He pointed out that it is only a matter of a few hundred years since everyone believed that the earth was flat! This is quite true, and this idea is quite a modern innovation. Except to a few profound thinkers such as Plato, the conception of the earth as a sphere was utterly foreign.' Gray watermark across text reads 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Text appears to be from religious or educational publication discussing history of cosmological models. Passage acknowledges flat Earth was universal belief until recently (few hundred years ago), then claims spherical Earth concept is 'modern innovation'. States only rare philosophers like Plato conceived of spherical Earth, implying it was alien to common understanding. Flat Earth proponents share this to argue globe model is recent invention rather than ancient knowledge. However, spherical Earth was established by ancient Greeks around 500 BCE, with Eratosthenes calculating circumference in 240 BCE. Medieval scholars also accepted spherical Earth. Passage reflects common misconception about flat Earth belief in history4:T5d1,Ocean sunset with flat horizon featuring Side-Eye Chloe meme. Shows dramatic seascape photograph at sunset over ocean or large body of water. Sky dominates image with spectacular cloud formations in layered horizontal bands. Top shows thick dark orange-brown clouds with textured undersides. Middle section displays golden-yellow illuminated clouds catching sunlight. Lower atmosphere shows gradient from bright orange-yellow to deep red-orange near horizon. Brilliant yellow-orange sun sits at horizon line appearing as perfect semi-circle half-submerged below water's edge. Sun creates bright golden reflection path across water surface. Water shows dark blue-black in foreground transitioning to red-orange reflections in middle distance. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight across entire width of image where water meets sky. Upper text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SILLY BALLERS "BELIEVE" WE ARE SEEING THE CURVE OF THE EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' in yellow text. Lower section displays white text: 'AT SEA LEVEL'. Lower right corner features small image of young blonde girl (Side-Eye Chloe meme - Chloe Clem viral photo from 2013) in purple jacket giving skeptical sideways glance with raised eyebrow, expressing doubt. Meme mocks 'ball Earthers' who claim to see Earth's curvature at sea level. Flat horizon used as evidence against spherical Earth. Side-Eye Chloe's skeptical expression reinforces ridicule toward mainstream belief5:T601,Gravitron carnival ride demonstrating centrifugal force opposite of gravity. Shows carnival amusement park ride in action. Large circular spinning ride called Gravitron with distinctive UFO/flying saucer appearance - silver-gray metallic dome with light blue accents and red trim bands. Decorative lights create retro sci-fi aesthetic. Top displays arched red sign reading 'GRAVITRON' in illuminated letters. Structure supported by yellow metal framework and safety barriers. Below, riders pressed against padded walls inside spinning chamber - centrifugal force pins them to perimeter as floor drops away. Visible riders wearing winter clothing (jackets, hoodies) stuck to red padded sections. One person in striped clothing, others in solid colors. Crowd visible at ground level watching. Background shows light blue evening sky with power lines. Middle text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE FASTER IT SPINS, THE MORE YOU STICK TO THE WALL'. Bottom text: 'PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW GRAVITY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK'. Bottom right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph at equator, centrifugal force should fling objects outward away from surface, opposite of gravitational attraction pulling inward. However, Earth's rotation creates minimal centrifugal force compared to gravity due to large radius. At equator, centrifugal acceleration is only 0.03 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s². Gravitron spins much faster in tight radius creating noticeable outward force0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-240","title":"Other 240","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671813_467779710088435_4298974868270770621_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-239","title":"Other 239","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671748_484313121768427_7361555279972798088_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-241","title":"Other 241","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687911_460794420786964_5550253741581559752_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
