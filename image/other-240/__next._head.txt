5:T629,Historical text excerpt claiming globe Earth as recent innovation. Shows photograph of aged printed page with tan-beige paper showing brown staining, wear, and aging. Text appears in traditional serif typeface suggesting old book or document. Visible header reads 'preparation for' followed by 'THE GLOBES' as section title. Main paragraph text states: 'A short time ago one of the Brethren questioned the adaptation of the balls to use for globes representing the terrestrial and celestial firmaments. He pointed out that it is only a matter of a few hundred years since everyone believed that the earth was flat! This is quite true, and this idea is quite a modern innovation. Except to a few profound thinkers such as Plato, the conception of the earth as a sphere was utterly foreign.' Gray watermark across text reads 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Text appears to be from religious or educational publication discussing history of cosmological models. Passage acknowledges flat Earth was universal belief until recently (few hundred years ago), then claims spherical Earth concept is 'modern innovation'. States only rare philosophers like Plato conceived of spherical Earth, implying it was alien to common understanding. Flat Earth proponents share this to argue globe model is recent invention rather than ancient knowledge. However, spherical Earth was established by ancient Greeks around 500 BCE, with Eratosthenes calculating circumference in 240 BCE. Medieval scholars also accepted spherical Earth. Passage reflects common misconception about flat Earth belief in history0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 240 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical text excerpt claiming globe Earth as recent innovation.
