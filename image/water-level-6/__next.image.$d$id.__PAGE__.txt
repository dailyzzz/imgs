3:T4a2,Serene waterscape photograph with hashtag '#ProveWaterToBeConvex' at top. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene with wooden pier posts or pilings extending into perfectly calm water creating mirror reflections. Row of weathered wooden posts visible on left side of image stretching toward horizon. Water surface appears completely flat and smooth like glass, reflecting vibrant pink, orange, and blue cloudy sky. Sky displays mixture of dark storm clouds and bright areas near horizon where sun creates golden-peach glow. Perfectly level horizon line where water meets sky. Quote overlay in white text: '"The fact that water is flat like a sheet of paper (when undisturbed by wind and tide) is my 'working anchor,' and the powerful 'ground tackle' of all those who reject the delusions of modern theoretical astronomy. Prove water to be convex, and we will at once and forever retant and grant you anything you like to demand."' Attribution: '-Thomas Winship'. Quote challenges spherical Earth model by asserting water's observable flatness when calm contradicts curved surface required by globe model. Demands proof of water convexity as prerequisite for accepting heliocentric astronomy4:T470,Six-panel collage demonstrating water's flat surface at all scales. Left column shows three examples: top - tall glass of water with label 'FLAT' pointing to level surface; middle - round fishbowl with goldfish and label 'FLAT' pointing to water surface; bottom - metal bucket/pail with water labeled 'FLAT'. Right column shows three larger-scale examples: top - blue swimming pool with lane dividers and 'FLAT' label; middle - mountain lake with perfect reflections of snow-capped peaks, evergreen trees on shore, labeled 'FLAT'; bottom - ocean horizon view with puffy white clouds and deep blue water, labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows aerial city skyline photo with text 'ON LAND WE USE LEVELERS WHICH ALSO CONTAINS WATER' followed by large text 'EARTH IS 71% WATER AND 29% LAND' and 'SO WHERE EXACTLY IS "THE CURVATURE"?' Watermark 'FLAT EARTH FOR DUMMIES'. Argues water always maintains level surface in all containers and bodies regardless of size, questioning where Earth's curvature exists if 71% is flat water. Uses construction levelers containing water bubbles as additional evidence that water defines level/flat surfaces0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-6","title":"Water Level 6","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962568_1473512486010947_2425436458586665699_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme about water curvature and scale. Top panel shows close-up photograph of small puddle in dirt/gravel with bird (appears to be crow or raven) standing in shallow water.

Bottom panel shows aerial/satellite view of large body of water (lake or bay) with irregular blue-turquoise colored water surrounded by green land masses, urban development visible on shores. White lines drawn across water surface suggesting measurement or emphasis on flat appearance. Argues that water remains flat regardless of scale - small puddle or massive lake both display level surfaces without curvature. Questions why oceans should curve to fit spherical Earth if smaller bodies of water demonstrably don't curve.
