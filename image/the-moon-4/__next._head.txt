Composite image shows approximately 25 moon phases arranged in arc across dark blue twilight sky above silhouetted mountain range with lit buildings/settlement in valley below. Text reads: 'The idea that this is caused due to a yearly \"wobbly\" of a so called Oblate Pear shaped earth that's hurdling through infinite space is unbelievable. Observing what you see here with logical thinking, it is clear that the Earth is Stationary.' Credit: '© Flat_Earth_Awakening' in bottom right. Argues moon's regular predictable path across sky (lunar arc) is better explained by stationary Earth with moon moving overhead rather than complex wobbling Earth motion through space.
