3:T45a,Humorous meme about open-mindedness to opposing views with white background. Top text in black: 'Study finds that hearing an opposing viewpoint causes no real harm.' Below shows photograph of Asian scientist or researcher in white lab coat with light blue shirt and striped tie, sitting in laboratory/office setting with computer, equipment, microscopes visible in background. Researcher appears to be explaining something with hand gestures, water bottle on desk. Person in background working at desk. Satirical commentary suggesting that despite scientific evidence showing exposure to opposing viewpoints is harmless, many people act as if contrary opinions are dangerous or harmful. Can be interpreted as critique of echo chambers, intellectual fragility, or cancel culture. In flat Earth context, might be used to argue mainstream science refuses to consider alternative theories about Earth's shape, or conversely that flat Earthers should be open to globe Earth evidence. Meme format implies ironic disconnect between scientific findings about open dialogue and actual practice of dismissing opposing views.4:T47f,Two-panel meme featuring Carl Sagan quote about evidence standards. Top panel shows Carl Sagan in suit and tie smiling at camera with planets/space background (moons or planets visible). Quote in white text: '"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."' with attribution 'Carl Sagan' in lower right. Bottom panel shows animated/CGI diagram of heliocentric solar system model with large yellow Sun at center, multiple blue circular orbital paths with small planets, white motion trails showing orbital trajectories creating complex looping patterns, Earth visible as small blue sphere. Text 'MEES NOT FILMATIC' in lower right corner. Juxtaposes Sagan's famous skeptical quote with heliocentric model, implying that Earth orbiting Sun is extraordinary claim lacking extraordinary evidence. Ironically uses Sagan's own standard to challenge mainstream astronomy, suggesting heliocentric model should be questioned using same skeptical criteria Sagan advocated for pseudoscientific claims. Reverses Sagan's intended application - he used this principle to critique fringe theories, not established science with centuries of supporting evidence.5:T422,Two-panel educational meme about cosmological curvature models with white background. Top text asks 'So which shape of space do you believe in?' Shows three geometric models with black gridlines: Top sphere labeled 'BALL' with 'Spherical Universe, Constant positive curvature' and notation 'Ω₀>1' with yellow boxes showing density equations 'Ω₀ = ρ/ρc' and 'ρc = 3H²/8πG' and 'ρ > ρc'. Middle shows saddle/hyperbolic shape labeled 'TOILET PAPER ROLL' with 'Hyperbolic Universe, Constant negative curvature' and 'Ω₀<1' with yellow box 'ρ < ρc'. Bottom shows flat plane labeled 'FLAT' with 'Flat Universe' and 'Ω₀=1' with yellow box 'ρ = ρc'. Bottom panel shows photograph of calm blue ocean horizon with white text 'Choose wisely.' Presents cosmological models (spherical, hyperbolic, flat universe based on density parameters) alongside literal interpretation, with ocean horizon image suggesting observable flatness supports flat universe model. Conflates cosmological curvature of spacetime with physical flatness of Earth's surface.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-25","title":"Pseudo Science 25","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/37243155_1983072245036951_3882111060706066432_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-24","title":"Pseudo Science 24","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/36711022_1713312795383237_3071697611518902272_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-26","title":"Pseudo Science 26","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/38474490_1770722136298215_6802765637476155392_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
