Tan/beige colored vintage-style world globe (showing continents and longitude/latitude lines) mounted on dark wooden base with felt pads on bottom. White rectangular sticker on base reads 'NOT FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY FOR DECORATIVE PURPOSE' with barcode above. Red and white sale sign below shows '$20' price marked down from 'Reg. 24.99' with text 'Sale ends Saturday' and 'Our Lowest Price of the Season!' Bottom label reads 'Decorative globe figural'. White store shelf with diamond pattern border. Humorous because disclaimer admits globe is purely decorative rather than accurate educational tool, potentially satirizing questions about globe Earth model accuracy."},"prevImage":{"id":"photoshop-11","title":"Photoshop 11","category":"photoshop","categoryDisplay":"Photoshop","src":"/images/gallery/photoshop/image-23.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'THE MAGIC BALL EARTH' with black background.
