Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) from 1999 comedy Office Space. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, burgundy/red suspenders, yellow tie with leopard/animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug. Has characteristic condescending smirk/smile expression. Blurred beige office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, doors visible. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'UMMM...YEAH, IF YOU COULD STOP SAYING YOU'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE FROM AN AIRPLANE'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate-speak ('that would be great') to mock common globe Earth claim. Many people report seeing Earth's curvature from commercial flights at 35,000-40,000 feet. Flat Earth proponents argue curvature isn't visible at these altitudes and what people see is either fisheye lens distortion from airplane windows or psychological expectation. Claims actual visibility of curvature requires much higher altitude (60,000+ feet)5:T556,Young woman graduate holding globe with George Orwell educational indoctrination quote. Shows graduate in black cap and gown wearing traditional mortarboard with tassel hanging left side. Holds colorful desktop globe showing blue oceans, tan/green continents, light pink/purple landmasses. Background is light blue/teal gradient. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Bottom features George Orwell quote in white text: 'THE FURTHER A SOCIETY DRIFTS FROM THE TRUTH, THE MORE IT WILL HATE THOSE WHO SPEAK IT. ~GEORGE ORWELL'. Bottom left corner watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Image argues that public education systems indoctrinate students with globe Earth model through repetition and authority rather than independent investigation. Cites Orwell (author of 1984) to suggest mainstream education is propaganda apparatus suppressing truth. Implies questioning institutional knowledge leads to social ostracism. Globe in graduate's hands symbolizes educational system literally putting worldview into students' possession without critical examination. Common flat Earth argument that people believe in globe Earth not because they've personally verified it, but because teachers, textbooks, and authority figures repeated it throughout childhood when critical thinking skills were undeveloped0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-195","title":"Other 195","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552861_455841464615593_7783021761301399950_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-194","title":"Other 194","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552819_457260614473678_7507966457741343678_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-196","title":"Other 196","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12565438_459893394210400_9196660274753455592_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
