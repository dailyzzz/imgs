13:T455,Four-panel educational meme titled 'ALL THESE THINGS' at top and 'CANNOT WORK ON THE GLOBE' at bottom. Top left shows submarine periscope emerging from calm ocean water with label 'PERISCOPE'. Top right shows lighthouse on rocky coast during stormy weather with label 'LIGHTHOUSE'. Bottom left shows mechanical gyroscope device with labeled parts: 'Gyroscope frame', 'Spin axis', 'Gimbal', and 'Rotor' with label 'GYROSCOPE'. Bottom right shows sundial on grass with shadow cast by sun with label 'SUNDIAL'. Argues these four technologies only function properly on flat Earth: periscopes work because water is level allowing straight-line viewing; lighthouses are visible beyond supposed curvature distance; gyroscopes maintain orientation without accounting for Earth's rotation; sundials work using sun's movement rather than Earth's rotation. Claims these practical instruments prove flat, stationary Earth and would fail or require compensation if Earth were rotating sphere. Questions why navigation and timekeeping tools designed for flat plane work perfectly without adjusting for curvature or rotation14:T470,Six-panel collage demonstrating water's flat surface at all scales. Left column shows three examples: top - tall glass of water with label 'FLAT' pointing to level surface; middle - round fishbowl with goldfish and label 'FLAT' pointing to water surface; bottom - metal bucket/pail with water labeled 'FLAT'. Right column shows three larger-scale examples: top - blue swimming pool with lane dividers and 'FLAT' label; middle - mountain lake with perfect reflections of snow-capped peaks, evergreen trees on shore, labeled 'FLAT'; bottom - ocean horizon view with puffy white clouds and deep blue water, labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows aerial city skyline photo with text 'ON LAND WE USE LEVELERS WHICH ALSO CONTAINS WATER' followed by large text 'EARTH IS 71% WATER AND 29% LAND' and 'SO WHERE EXACTLY IS "THE CURVATURE"?' Watermark 'FLAT EARTH FOR DUMMIES'. Argues water always maintains level surface in all containers and bodies regardless of size, questioning where Earth's curvature exists if 71% is flat water. Uses construction levelers containing water bubbles as additional evidence that water defines level/flat surfaces9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-8","title":"Water Level 8","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/16266229_10212397836681450_3016190395013929116_n.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-7","title":"Water Level 7","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962718_1473512442677618_6178428728764111783_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-9","title":"Water Level 9","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18402805_125962337965790_3495852714320985349_n.jpeg","description":"Simple logic meme with gradient blue background showing ocean scene. Top two-thirds displays white text in equation format: 'WATER DOESN'T CURVE + EARTH IS 70% WATER = EARTH IS FLAT' using large bold letters with black outlines. Bottom third shows photograph of deep blue ocean with small white sailboat on horizon line under light blue sky with white clouds. Photo credit 'Nick Havok' in bottom left corner. Presents syllogistic argument: if water demonstrably doesn't curve (as observable in containers, lakes, oceans), and Earth's surface is 70% water, then Earth must be flat rather than spherical. Uses mathematical equation format to present logical deduction from two premises to conclusion. Combines observable property of water (always seeks level) with Earth's composition to conclude planet must be flat plane. Sailboat photograph emphasizes flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, supporting visual claim of non-curved water surface extending to distance"}}]
