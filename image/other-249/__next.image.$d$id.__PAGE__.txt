3:T604,Apollo command module water training mockingly labeled as gravitational waves. Shows vintage NASA training photograph at outdoor facility. Large white Apollo command module mockup floating in bright turquoise-blue swimming pool. Module displays conical shape with gray heat shield base, white upper section, small windows visible, yellow equipment or framework attached to top. Pool appears to be large rectangular training tank with concrete edges. Multiple people in water - several wearing light-colored flight suits or training gear floating on yellow inflatable rafts positioned around module. One person appears to be practicing water egress procedures. Another person swimming in water. Personnel on pool deck visible in background wearing white shirts. Background shows brown fence, utility poles, power lines, open flat landscape suggesting desert or coastal training facility (likely Ellington Field or similar NASA site). Sky shows overcast gray-blue conditions. Lower left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom center shows large white text with black outline: 'GRAVITY WAVES'. Image satirizes 2016 LIGO gravitational wave detection announcement by showing literal water waves in NASA training pool. Moon landing skeptics point to Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory underwater training as evidence spacewalk footage was filmed in pools rather than space. Suggests 'gravity waves' are just water ripples from astronaut pool training rather than cosmic phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general relativity4:T5c9,Missing milk carton parody featuring Earth's missing curvature. Shows 3D rendered illustration of classic red and white milk carton design against plain white background. Carton displays traditional gable-top shape with triangular peaked roof and small rectangular tab at top. Left side panel shows vertical red and white stripes with large red text 'MILK' repeated vertically. Front panel features missing person poster format with red header 'MISSING' at top. Below header shows black band with white text 'CURVATURE'. Center displays photograph of Earth from space - classic Blue Marble style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents visible against black space background. Bottom right of photo shows 'JM' signature watermark. Below photo, red text reads 'Have you Seen me?' in friendly font. Lower section contains mock missing person details in black italicized text: 'LAST SPOTTED ON NEVER' with 'NEVER' emphasized. Next line: 'IF FOUND: PLEASE CONTACT NASA' with 'NASA' in capital letters. Final line: 'REWARD: CREDIBILITY' with 'CREDIBILITY' in capital letters. Left panel shows vertical text reading 'HOMOGENIZED PASTEURIZED' in red. Satirical image mocks inability to observe Earth's curvature from ground level despite spherical Earth model. Suggests curvature is theoretical construct never actually witnessed in reality. 'Reward: Credibility' implies finding observable curvature would restore NASA's trustworthiness5:T5f7,Lake Pontchartrain Causeway aerial view claiming missing curvature over 23.87 miles. Shows aerial photograph of Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana from high altitude. Image captured from aircraft looking down at bridge stretching diagonally across frame from upper left to lower right. Bridge appears as two parallel white-gray concrete roadways with yellow center line markings running perfectly straight across water. Structure extends to horizon creating geometric line bisecting image. Left side and upper portion shows land or developed shoreline area - tan-brown urban/suburban development visible with roads, buildings, structures creating textured landscape meeting water's edge. Right side and lower portion shows Lake Pontchartrain water in light turquoise-blue color extending to horizon. Water surface appears smooth with slight texture. Sky shows light blue gradient with white clouds. Bridge appears absolutely straight with no visible curve despite 23+ mile length. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN CAUSEWAY METAIRIE, LA'. Center displays translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in white bold letters: '23.87 MILES LONG 380 FEET OF MISSING CURVATURE'. Flat Earth argument calculates using 8 inches per mile squared formula: at 23.87 miles, Earth's curvature should create 380 foot drop requiring bridge to arc upward to compensate, but bridge appears straight. Mainstream explanation: camera angle and atmospheric refraction affect perception0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-249","title":"Other 249","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698457_465227530343653_6140738402944405606_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-248","title":"Other 248","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698243_464898840376522_6791307062651726646_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-250","title":"Other 250","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698459_462795033920236_8668119608642346417_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
