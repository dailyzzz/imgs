5:T604,Apollo command module water training mockingly labeled as gravitational waves. Shows vintage NASA training photograph at outdoor facility. Large white Apollo command module mockup floating in bright turquoise-blue swimming pool. Module displays conical shape with gray heat shield base, white upper section, small windows visible, yellow equipment or framework attached to top. Pool appears to be large rectangular training tank with concrete edges. Multiple people in water - several wearing light-colored flight suits or training gear floating on yellow inflatable rafts positioned around module. One person appears to be practicing water egress procedures. Another person swimming in water. Personnel on pool deck visible in background wearing white shirts. Background shows brown fence, utility poles, power lines, open flat landscape suggesting desert or coastal training facility (likely Ellington Field or similar NASA site). Sky shows overcast gray-blue conditions. Lower left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom center shows large white text with black outline: 'GRAVITY WAVES'. Image satirizes 2016 LIGO gravitational wave detection announcement by showing literal water waves in NASA training pool. Moon landing skeptics point to Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory underwater training as evidence spacewalk footage was filmed in pools rather than space. Suggests 'gravity waves' are just water ripples from astronaut pool training rather than cosmic phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general relativity0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 249 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo command module water training mockingly labeled as gravitational waves.
