Conspiracy theory meme alleging Einstein had no legitimate scientific accomplishments and was promoted from obscurity to fame by Jesuit order (Catholic religious organization). Claims Einstein's theories were fraudulent and his prominence was manufactured by religious conspiracy rather than earned through scientific work. Ignores Einstein's documented contributions including special relativity (1905), general relativity (1915), photoelectric effect (Nobel Prize 1921), and numerous other papers.
