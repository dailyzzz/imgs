Top panel shows sunset over ocean with bright white-yellow sun relatively high above reddish-orange horizon, appearing larger. White text states 'It is impossible for the Sun to appear to change in size if the Sun is millions of miles away.' Small 'PW' logo in corner with text 'This is your wake up call.' Bottom panel shows later sunset moment with sun appearing as smaller red-orange semicircle touching darker horizon line. White text explains 'The Sun is smaller than we've been told. The Sun traverses above Earth, illuminating locally.' with 'Don't go back to sleep! you know this is true. Research Flat Earth.' Argues that observable change in sun's angular size from high sun to setting sun proves sun is close and moving away horizontally rather than distant sun being viewed through increasing atmospheric thickness. Uses apparent size variation as evidence for local sun model over heliocentric distant sun"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-37","title":"The Sun 37","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/Flat-Earth-Memes-417-14.jpeg","description":"Star Trek meme featuring Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) from The Next Generation pointing forward in command pose wearing red Starfleet uniform. Bridge visible in background with crew member. Pink text at top reads 'the sun is 70% helium' and bottom text asks 'how does it generate gravity'. Questions how sun can have gravitational pull if composed primarily of helium, a very light gas that floats in Earth's atmosphere. Argues that helium's low density and buoyant properties on Earth contradict sun's supposed massive gravitational influence holding planets in orbit. Challenges mainstream solar physics claim that sun is ~73% hydrogen and ~25% helium by mass, questioning how gaseous composition creates gravity. Ignores that gravity depends on total mass regardless of composition, and that sun's enormous mass (despite being mostly light elements) creates immense gravitational field.

Top text reads 'WHAT IF THE EARTH REALLY IS CIRCULAR' and bottom text states 'AND ERATOSTHENES IS JUST AN IDIOT'. References Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-194 BC), Greek mathematician who famously calculated Earth's circumference using shadow angles from two cities (Alexandria and Syene), proving Earth is spherical. Meme humorously suggests rejecting Eratosthenes' well-established mathematical proof by questioning his intelligence rather than addressing his methodology. Plays on 'Conspiracy Keanu' format where obvious facts are questioned in absurd ways. Could be interpreted as flat Earth skepticism of ancient Greek geometry, or as satire of people who dismiss historical scientific achievements without understanding the methods used.
