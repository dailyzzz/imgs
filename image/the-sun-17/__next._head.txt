Sky displays gradient from deep teal at top through coral pink and golden orange near horizon, with layered clouds illuminated in brilliant gold and purple. Bright white semicircle of sun sits precisely at horizon line, casting golden reflection path across calm water surface toward viewer. Orange and blue atmospheric layers create striking color contrast. Dark clouds with golden-edged outlines stretch horizontally across sky. Photo credit: © Jose Rivera.
