Sky displays gradient from deep teal at top through coral pink and golden orange near horizon, with layered clouds illuminated in brilliant gold and purple. Bright white semicircle of sun sits precisely at horizon line, casting golden reflection path across calm water surface toward viewer. Orange and blue atmospheric layers create striking color contrast. Dark clouds with golden-edged outlines stretch horizontally across sky. Photo credit: © Jose Rivera. High-quality nature photography often used in flat Earth discussions to question how sun can appear to set below horizon if Earth is flat, though image actually demonstrates Earth's spherical geometry through curved horizon obscuring bottom half of sun"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-16","title":"The Sun 16","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/246173748_1042830916559354_1101154082989590533_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme demonstrating local sun model creating day/night cycle. Top panel shows nighttime residential street scene with streetlight illuminating road with warm orange glow, labeled 'DAY' under lit area and 'NIGHT' in dark areas beyond light's reach. Bottom panel shows similar street scene with streetlight creating circular pool of yellow light on pavement, again labeled 'DAY' in illuminated area and 'NIGHT' in surrounding darkness. Large white text reads 'HOW A SMALL LOCAL SUN CAN CREATE DAY AND NIGHT' with '@flatworldlogic' watermark. Uses streetlight analogy to explain flat Earth day/night cycle: small, close sun acts like spotlight moving over flat Earth plane, illuminating local area (creating day) while areas outside light cone remain dark (night). Presents alternative to Earth's rotation explanation, arguing local sun with limited illumination radius can create observable day/night pattern on stationary flat surface"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-18","title":"The Sun 18","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/270161749_10158538306972913_2305255635233498021_n.jpeg","description":"Dramatic sunset photograph over ocean showing sun partially obscured by layered dark storm clouds, creating striking silhouette effect. Large cloud bank sits at horizon with sun visible as bright white semicircle being cut by cloud layers, displaying unusual cup or bowl shape due to atmospheric refraction and cloud obstruction. Sky shows warm orange and coral gradient near horizon transitioning to darker golden-brown and gray tones above. Cloud edges illuminated with brilliant golden-orange backlighting creating glowing outline effect. Calm blue ocean water fills lower portion of frame. Single contrail or cloud streak visible in upper left corner. Demonstrates complex atmospheric optics where refraction, cloud layers, and perspective create unusual sun shapes during sunset, phenomena sometimes interpreted as evidence for alternative cosmological models when effects of atmospheric refraction and cloud cover are not considered"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
