Uses Orwellian doublespeak showing how negative things (war, drugs, debt) are marketed as positive. Black section below shows spherical Earth image with white text: '...and our world is a floating pear that came from nothing.' Uses pear-shaped Earth image (slightly elongated at bottom) to mock globe Earth model, suggesting it's another absurd globalization narrative alongside wars/drugs/debt propaganda.
