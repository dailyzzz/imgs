3:T9df,Person in ice cave with text about water level versus convexity argument. Atmospheric photograph with philosophical text overlaid making flat Earth water level argument. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows silhouette of person standing in opening of ice cave or glacier tunnel. Person appears small against massive ice formation, positioned in center looking outward. Ice walls visible on sides - brilliant white/light blue glacial ice with textured surface showing layers, cracks, formations. Opening frames view of outside landscape visible as bright light area. Sky beyond shows gradient from white to deep blue suggesting daytime with clear conditions. Person's silhouette backlit creating dramatic contrast - appears to be standing, possibly wearing jacket or backpack. Ice formations create natural arch/tunnel framing the scene. Blue lighting dominates image with cooler tones - characteristic of glacier/ice cave photography where thick ice filters sunlight creating ethereal blue glow. Text overlay in white centered on lower portion of image: 'If the Earth is spherical then it follows that the surface of all Earth's water, including the massive oceans, must maintain a certain degree of convexity. But this is contrary to the fundamental physical nature of water to always be and remain level!' Statement makes classic flat Earth argument about water finding its level. Claims convex water surface contradicts water's nature. Core misunderstanding: 'level' doesn't mean flat in absolute sense - means perpendicular to gravitational force direction. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface. Water DOES curve following Earth's sphere while remaining 'level' locally at every point. Gravity pulls toward Earth's center, not uniformly downward in absolute sense. Every location's 'down' points toward planetary core. Therefore water surfaces curve globally while appearing level locally. Observable evidence of water curvature: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon (water curves between observer and ship), inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon distance, submarine and ship navigation using spherical trigonometry, need for locks in Panama/Suez canals accounting for different 'sea level' (both tangent to sphere but different absolute heights). Image location in ice cave/glacier ironic since glaciers flow downhill following gravity, demonstrating water responds to gravitational field consistent with spherical Earth4:T8e8,Wernher von Braun Operation Paperclip Nazi rocket scientist collage arguing NASA founded by Nazis. Multi-panel historical photograph collage highlighting Wernher von Braun's Nazi past and role founding NASA space program. Top section shows two black and white photographs from 1940s Nazi Germany. Left photo: von Braun in dark suit standing among Nazi military officers in Wehrmacht uniforms with caps, military decorations visible. Right photo: Close-up of von Braun in civilian dark suit surrounded by Nazi SS officers in uniform with peaked caps showing Nazi insignia. Photos document his role as technical director of Nazi V-2 rocket program at Peenemünde. Large white text spanning top: 'WERNHER VON BRAUN'. Red text below: 'NAZI ROCKET SCIENTIST'. Middle section shows photographs from post-war America. Left: von Braun in sunglasses standing at Cape Canaveral with rocket launch structures visible in background. Center: Large Saturn V rocket engines/components showing massive F-1 engine bells used in Apollo moon missions. Right: von Braun in suit examining rocket hardware. White text: 'ESCAPING CHARGES IN THE NUREMBERG TRIALS HE WAS LATER SMUGGLED INTO THE U.S. UNDER OPERATION: PAPERCLIP'. Bottom section shows NASA era photos. Left: Elderly von Braun in NASA facility. Center: Row of Saturn V rockets displayed vertically. Right: von Braun in suit standing before rockets. Large white text: 'WHERE HE WAS MADE 1ST DIRECTOR OF NASA'S MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER'. Lower right: 'Nick Havok' signature. Collage presents historical facts about Operation Paperclip - secret program recruiting German scientists after WWII, including von Braun and team. Von Braun used slave labor from Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp during V-2 production, causing thousands of deaths. His SS membership and knowledge of atrocities controversial. However, his technical contributions to US space program undeniable - Saturn V development enabled Apollo moon landings. Meme implies NASA fundamentally tainted by Nazi origins, suggesting space program continues Nazi deception/propaganda. While historical connection factual, modern NASA evolved far beyond von Braun, includes diverse international scientists, operates transparently with public missions verified by independent nations5:T9b2,Antarctic ice shelves collage with 'Why don't we fall off the edge?' question. Four-panel photographic collage showing Antarctic ice formations with flat Earth edge question. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'WHY DON'T WE FALL OFF THE EDGE?' Four panels arranged 2x2 grid showing dramatic Antarctic scenery. Top left: Aerial view of red icebreaker ship navigating through broken sea ice and dark blue-black ocean water. Ship appears small against vast seascape with white ice floes scattered across water surface. Gray overcast sky. Top right: Massive tabular iceberg floating in calm ocean - distinctive flat-topped ice formation with vertical white-cream colored walls showing horizontal stratification layers. Iceberg appears house-sized with perfectly vertical cliffs. Deep teal-blue water, lighter blue-gray sky. Bottom left: Enormous ice shelf wall viewed from water level - massive vertical cliff face of pure white glacial ice extending horizontally across frame. Perfectly flat top edge like ruler-straight line against dark gray sky. Vertical striations and texture visible in ice face. Dark navy ocean water at base. Perspective emphasizes scale and geometric flatness of ice shelf edge. Bottom right: Another tabular iceberg with steep vertical walls - irregular angular shape floating in turquoise-blue water. White-cream ice shows layered structure. Lower right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in white text. Collage uses images of Antarctic ice shelves - particularly tabular icebergs and ice shelf edges with their characteristic flat tops and vertical faces - to suggest visual metaphor for 'edge of flat Earth'. Flat-topped icebergs result from ice shelf calving where chunks break off Antarctic ice sheet floating on ocean. Flat tops represent former surface of ice sheet. However, these are simply floating ice formations, not edge of world. Images show Antarctica's coastline where continental ice meets ocean, not planetary boundary. In flat Earth model, Antarctica forms ice wall around perimeter preventing people from reaching edge. However, Antarctica is well-explored continent at Earth's South Pole, circumnavigated many times, with permanent research stations from numerous countries. Ships regularly sail around it. No ice wall exists preventing circumnavigation. Gravity prevents 'falling off' - on sphere, 'down' points toward planetary center from all surface locations, so no edge exists to fall from0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-308","title":"Other 308","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747465_465960070270399_9062437940598786058_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-307","title":"Other 307","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745930_466668016866271_3802006221260945192_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-309","title":"Other 309","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747902_467916246741448_492441545354721726_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
