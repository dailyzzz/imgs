3:T465,Black background with white text quote and azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map icon. Left side shows white-bordered square containing high-contrast black and white flat Earth map projection with North Pole at center, continents visible in black silhouettes against white background. Bottom left text reads 'Investigate flat earth.' in gray sans-serif font. Right side displays white text quote: 'There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation.' Attribution below: '(Herbert Spencer)' in parentheses. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo in gray. Quote from philosopher Herbert Spencer argues that dismissing ideas without investigation ensures ignorance. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests people reject flat Earth theory due to prejudice rather than genuine examination of evidence. Argues mainstream dismissal of flat Earth is emotional/social conformity rather than rational scientific evaluation. Calls for open-minded investigation before forming conclusions4:T491,Historical black and white photograph from 1955 showing Admiral Richard E. Byrd in television interview setting. Two men seated in dark leather chairs - left figure (civilian) wearing dark suit, glasses, and bow tie holds notepad, appears to be interviewer. Right figure (Admiral Byrd) wears light-colored military dress uniform with rank insignia, medals and decorations visible on chest. Behind them on wall is large azimuthal equidistant map projection showing flat Earth model with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map clearly visible above 'ATLANTIC OCEAN' text. Bottom text overlay: 'ADMIRAL BYRD IN FRONT OF AN AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT MAP - 1955'. Getty Images watermark 'NBC NewsWire' visible. Bottom corner shows '1450110923' and 'memes.com'. Admiral Byrd was famous polar explorer who led expeditions to Antarctica. Flat Earth proponents cite his use of azimuthal equidistant projection as evidence he knew true shape of Earth. However, this map projection is standard for polar navigation/aviation regardless of belief in spherical Earth. Image suggests official military/government use of flat Earth map model in 1950s television broadcasts5:T502,Educational indoctrination meme featuring young woman in black graduation cap and gown. Graduate has long brown hair, holds small colorful desktop globe in both hands in front of chest. Globe shows blue oceans, green/yellow/pink continents with country labels visible. Light gray/white background creates clean portrait composition. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom section shows George Orwell quote in smaller white text: '"Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me." - George Orwell' with 'fb.com/fematters' attribution below. Argues spherical Earth belief stems from childhood education indoctrination rather than personal investigation or evidence. Uses graduation imagery to symbolize completion of systematic programming. Orwell quote questions blind acceptance of scientific consensus by general public who haven't personally verified claims. Suggests educational system teaches obedience to authority rather than critical thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-145","title":"Other 145","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439156_451896538343419_2749766266179285728_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-144","title":"Other 144","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439062_453778468155226_3501745846254491879_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-146","title":"Other 146","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439456_474835499382856_8730171841154972512_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
