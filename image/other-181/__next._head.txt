5:T504,Apollo Lunar Module construction materials skepticism meme. Shows close-up photograph of Apollo LM (Lunar Module) in space or on moon with black space background. Module displays distinctive gold/bronze metallic thermal foil covering, angular geometric shape with flat panels, landing legs visible at bottom. Gray/silver structural elements, black shadows create harsh contrast. Module appears fragile, makeshift with wrinkled foil, exposed framework, various protrusions and antennae. Top text in bold white letters: 'NASA CLAIMS THEY WENT TO THE MOON IN THIS...' Bottom text: 'IF YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE FOIL, TAPE, AND CURTAIN RODS.' Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skepticism questioning spacecraft's construction quality and materials. Mocks LM's appearance as flimsy, homemade-looking craft assembled from household materials. 'Curtain rods' reference disparages structural elements as looking like bathroom fixtures rather than space-grade engineering. Argues module appears too primitive/fragile to survive space travel, radiation, moon landing. Conspiracy theorists point to wrinkled foil and visible tape as evidence of studio prop rather than functional spacecraft. Questions how such apparently crude construction could withstand claimed journey0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 181 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo Lunar Module construction materials skepticism meme.
