13:T504,Apollo Lunar Module construction materials skepticism meme. Shows close-up photograph of Apollo LM (Lunar Module) in space or on moon with black space background. Module displays distinctive gold/bronze metallic thermal foil covering, angular geometric shape with flat panels, landing legs visible at bottom. Gray/silver structural elements, black shadows create harsh contrast. Module appears fragile, makeshift with wrinkled foil, exposed framework, various protrusions and antennae. Top text in bold white letters: 'NASA CLAIMS THEY WENT TO THE MOON IN THIS...' Bottom text: 'IF YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE FOIL, TAPE, AND CURTAIN RODS.' Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skepticism questioning spacecraft's construction quality and materials. Mocks LM's appearance as flimsy, homemade-looking craft assembled from household materials. 'Curtain rods' reference disparages structural elements as looking like bathroom fixtures rather than space-grade engineering. Argues module appears too primitive/fragile to survive space travel, radiation, moon landing. Conspiracy theorists point to wrinkled foil and visible tape as evidence of studio prop rather than functional spacecraft. Questions how such apparently crude construction could withstand claimed journey14:T4fa,Salar de Uyuni salt flats perfect mirror with curvature question. Shows spectacular photograph of Bolivia's salt flats during rainy season. Thin layer of water creates flawless mirror reflection making sky and ground indistinguishable. Upper half shows dramatic cloudscape - brilliant blue sky with massive white and gray cumulus clouds scattered across. Darker storm clouds visible on left. Lower half shows perfect mirror reflection of entire sky scene in still water. Lone silhouetted figure walks across middle of frame, body and reflection creating symmetrical composition. Person appears to walk between two identical skies. Horizon line where actual sky meets reflection is nearly invisible. Salt flat extends in all directions appearing completely flat and level. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHERE DOES THE CURVE START?' Bottom right watermark 'thetrutherfactory'. Uses one of nature's most perfect mirror surfaces to question Earth's curvature. Argues if Earth curves, the perfectly flat mirror reflection extending for miles shouldn't be possible. Questions at what distance curvature should become visible. Salar de Uyuni spans 10,582 square kilometers - flat Earth proponents argue this vast flat surface contradicts spherical Earth model15:T4b8,Space photography Hollywood basement conspiracy meme. Black space background. Upper portion shows International Space Station (ISS) with distinctive white/gray modules, gold solar panel arrays extending outward, various components and structures visible against black void. Lower portion shows Space Shuttle orbiter in white with black heat tiles, distinctive delta wing shape, tail vertical stabilizer, approaching or near curved Earth showing blue oceans, white clouds, brown-green landmasses. Top text in bold white letters: 'SPACE MAY BE THE FINAL FRONTIER'. Bottom text: 'BUT IT'S MADE IN A HOLLYWOOD BASEMENT.' References Red Hot Chili Peppers song 'Californication' lyrics about Hollywood's manufactured reality. Argues all space imagery (ISS, shuttle, Earth photos) is filmed in movie studios rather than actual space. 'Hollywood basement' suggests low-budget deception - not even main soundstage but basement. Implies space program is entertainment production rather than scientific endeavor. Questions authenticity of all NASA/space agency imagery as special effects and CGI rather than real photography from orbit. Connects space exploration to Hollywood's history of creating convincing illusions9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-181","title":"Other 181","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12523054_455800094619730_8223789282222809336_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-180","title":"Other 180","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12514038_454174674782272_4416362959406589445_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-182","title":"Other 182","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12524295_458833000983106_1675931569722510132_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
