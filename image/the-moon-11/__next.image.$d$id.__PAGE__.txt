Left panel captioned 'My first cell phone, weighs 14 pounds, range 5 miles, 1966 near Nha Be, Vietnam' shows soldier in green helmet operating large military field radio equipment (PRC-25 or similar backpack radio) with long antenna while sitting on ground. Right panel titled '1969' shows black and white photo of President Richard Nixon in suit using telephone at desk with moon landing footage visible on TV screen behind him, captioned 'Hello Neil and Buzz...' Highlights apparent technological paradox: bulky 1966 military radio with 5-mile range versus claimed 1969 real-time telephone communication across 240,000 miles to astronauts on moon, questioning feasibility of Earth-Moon voice communication given limited terrestrial radio technology just 3 years earlier."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
