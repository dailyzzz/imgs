'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in large bold white letters at top. White curved airplane engine cowling visible in lower left foreground. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level extending across entire width of image where dark ocean or land meets sky. Sky shows spectacular gradient from deep blue-purple at top transitioning through lighter blue in middle to brilliant orange-yellow-red sunset colors at horizon. Thin bright orange-red band marks exact horizon line. Colors create natural ombre effect. Ocean or landscape below appears as dark blue-gray mass. Image taken at high altitude (30,000+ feet). Despite high altitude view, horizon appears completely flat with no visible curvature, which flat Earth proponents use as evidence against spherical Earth. Argues human eye should detect curvature at commercial flight altitudes if Earth were globe. Beautiful natural colors contrast with controversial message"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-128","title":"Other 128","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12313615_440639949469078_3316048427749114436_n.jpg","description":"Antique book cover resting against beige and brown brick wall. Dark teal or blue-green hardcover book with gold embossed lettering. Title reads 'IS THE BIBLE FROM HEAVEN?' at top. Center shows geometric diagram/symbol resembling flat Earth model or cosmology chart with dome and circular design. Below diagram asks 'IS THE EARTH A GLOBE?' Book appears worn with age, showing vintage binding. Questioning rhetorical titles imply both questions have same answer - suggesting Bible's cosmology describes flat stationary Earth rather than spinning globe. Historical flat Earth literature from religious perspective. Book likely from late 1800s or early 1900s when flat Earth movement had religious following. Argues biblical cosmology contradicts heliocentric globe model, presenting dichotomy between scriptural authority and modern astronomy"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-130","title":"Other 130","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321512_479749088891497_152611109440113677_n.jpg","description":"Parody of iconic NASA logo on black background. Shows circular blue sphere (representing Earth or space) with white orbital ring/swoosh and white stars scattered across surface. Instead of 'NASA' text, large white letters spell 'LIARS' in NASA's signature font style. Red vector/chevron swoosh crosses diagonally through circle matching NASA logo design. Top text in light blue reads 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' in clean sans-serif font. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text with 'fb.com/fematters' social media handle below. Perfect mimicry of NASA's logo design language but replacing agency name with accusation of dishonesty. Implies space agency deliberately deceives public about Earth's shape and nature of space. Encourages independent research into flat Earth theory. Visual rhetoric uses authority and recognition of NASA branding to undermine that same authority by calling them liars"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
