'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in large bold white letters at top. White curved airplane engine cowling visible in lower left foreground. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level extending across entire width of image where dark ocean or land meets sky. Sky shows spectacular gradient from deep blue-purple at top transitioning through lighter blue in middle to brilliant orange-yellow-red sunset colors at horizon. Thin bright orange-red band marks exact horizon line. Colors create natural ombre effect. Ocean or landscape below appears as dark blue-gray mass. Image taken at high altitude (30,000+ feet). Despite high altitude view, horizon appears completely flat with no visible curvature, which flat Earth proponents use as evidence against spherical Earth. Argues human eye should detect curvature at commercial flight altitudes if Earth were globe. Beautiful natural colors contrast with controversial message"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Other 129"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Stunning aerial sunset photograph taken from airplane window showing view over engine nacelle/cowling.
