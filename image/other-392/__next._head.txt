5:T1e99,Globe illustration with world landmarks wishing for 2016 to be "the year when people remembered that science is a method of investigation and not a belief system." Flat Earth meme appropriating scientific skepticism language to position flat Earth as legitimate inquiry versus mainstream science as dogmatic belief. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Artistic globe illustration with famous landmarks positioned around Earth, combined with motivational New Year's wish text criticizing mainstream science as belief system. CENTRAL GLOBE: Stylized spherical Earth illustration showing continents and oceans. Blue planet representation with recognizable continental shapes. Clouds/atmosphere visible around globe. Artistic rendering rather than photographic image. Ironically uses globe illustration in flat Earth content - though image criticizes mainstream science, not specifically globe Earth shape. WORLD LANDMARKS: Famous structures positioned around globe as if standing on surface: STATUE OF LIBERTY (New York, USA): Green copper statue visible on left side. Classic torch-bearing figure representing American liberty. LEANING TOWER OF PISA (Italy): Distinctive tilted white marble tower. Medieval Italian architecture landmark. BIG BEN/ELIZABETH TOWER (London, UK): Iconic clock tower from UK Parliament. Gothic Revival architecture style. EIFFEL TOWER (Paris, France): Iron lattice tower, most famous Parisian landmark. SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE: Distinctive shell-shaped roof structure visible. Landmarks represent global human achievement and civilization - suggests worldwide scope of discussion about science. AIRPLANE: Commercial aircraft flying across top of image. Suggests international travel and modern technology. Also represents aerial perspective of Earth. SKY BACKGROUND: Blue sky with white clouds. Bright, optimistic atmospheric conditions. Suggests clarity, openness, enlightenment. TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "I WOULD LIKE 2016 TO BE THE YEAR" - New Year's wish format (image dated from 2016 based on Facebook timestamp pattern). RIGHT SIDE TEXT: "When people remembered that science is a method of investigation," - First part of core message. BOTTOM TEXT: "AND NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM" - Conclusion of argument. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SCIENCE IS METHOD, NOT DOGMA: Image appropriates valid philosophical point - science IS a method (hypothesis, testing, revision) not a fixed set of conclusions. Flat Earthers argue that mainstream "scientists" treat conclusions (spherical Earth, evolution, etc.) as sacred beliefs rather than testable hypotheses. Calling something "science" doesn't make it true - only evidence and testing do. 2) SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT AS RELIGION: Implication is that modern science has become faith-based belief system where questioning established conclusions is treated as heresy. Scientists who challenge consensus face career consequences. Peer review becomes enforcement mechanism for orthodoxy. Scientific "consensus" is appeal to authority, not evidence. 3) FLAT EARTH AS TRUE SKEPTICISM: If science is method, then everything should be open to question - including Earth's shape. Flat Earthers claim they're applying scientific method by questioning assumptions. Demanding evidence for globe Earth is what scientists SHOULD do. Those who refuse to question globe are being religious, not scientific. 4) INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION: Image encourages people to investigate claims themselves rather than trust authorities. Don't believe Earth is round because scientists say so - test it yourself. Personal observation and experiment should override expert consensus. TRUE NATURE OF SCIENCE: While image makes superficially valid point (science IS method), it misrepresents how science actually works: 1) SCIENCE DOES QUESTION ASSUMPTIONS: Scientific paradigm shifts happen regularly (plate tectonics, quantum mechanics, relativity). Scientists who overturn established theories WIN Nobel Prizes, don't face persecution. Difference: Successful challenges come with BETTER EVIDENCE and PREDICTIONS, not just contrarianism. 2) CONSENSUS BASED ON EVIDENCE: Scientific consensus on Earth's shape isn't "belief" - it's conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. Consensus can change when evidence warrants - but requires evidence, not assertion. Globe Earth "consensus" is actually verified millions of times daily by navigation, aviation, telecommunications, astronomy. 3) EXPERTISE MATTERS: "Do your own research" sounds democratic but ignores that some questions require specialized knowledge. Amateur investigations without proper methodology often reach wrong conclusions. Dunning-Kruger effect: Less knowledge = more confidence in incorrect conclusions. 4) FALSIFIABILITY: Scientific claims must be falsifiable - and globe Earth IS testable and has survived every test. Flat Earth claims are NOT falsifiable - any evidence against them is dismissed as fake. Which approach is more "scientific"? FALSE EQUIVALENCE: Image creates false equivalence between: Flat Earth believers questioning everything (presented as scientific skepticism). Scientists accepting evidence-based conclusions (presented as religious faith). But: Accepting conclusions supported by vast evidence isn't "belief" - it's rational. Rejecting evidence to maintain preferred conclusion IS belief-based thinking. Flat Earth community rejects photographic evidence, physics, navigation, astronomy - that's dogmatism, not skepticism. APPROPRIATION OF SKEPTICISM: Flat Earth community strategically uses language of skepticism and scientific method while practicing opposite: Claim to question everything - but don't question flat Earth assumptions. Claim to want evidence - but reject all evidence for globe Earth as "fake." Claim to use scientific method - but don't conduct controlled experiments with proper methodology. Claim mainstream science is biased - but use extreme confirmation bias themselves. This isn't skepticism - it's selective doubt applied only to conclusions they dislike while accepting preferred conclusions uncritically. 2016 CONTEXT: Image appears to be from early 2016 based on "2016 to be the year" framing. 2016 saw significant growth in flat Earth community via YouTube and social media. "Post-truth" discourse and distrust of institutions was expanding. Image reflects moment when flat Earth movement was gaining mainstream attention. VISUAL RHETORIC: Globe with landmarks is aspirational, positive imagery - world civilization and human achievement. Motivational New Year's wish format feels optimistic, constructive. Message sounds reasonable without context - who could disagree that science is method? Clean, professional design suggests legitimate source. Doesn't explicitly mention flat Earth - works as gateway content attracting those skeptical of institutions before introducing specific flat Earth claims. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works because: Core claim (science = method) is technically true. Doesn't immediately reveal flat Earth agenda. Appeals to values most people share (questioning, evidence). Creates feeling of intellectual sophistication. Positions flat Earthers as true scientists, mainstream as dogmatists. Effective entry point for flat Earth recruitment - agree with reasonable premise, then accept flat Earth conclusions as logical extension. IRONY: Image uses globe illustration to criticize "belief" in globe Earth. Calls for questioning assumptions while assuming flat Earth without evidence. Demands scientific method while flat Earth fails basic scientific testing. Claims others are dogmatic while flat Earth community rejects all contrary evidence. Meta-irony: Message about science being method (not belief) is correct - and when properly applied to flat Earth claim, scientific method conclusively demonstrates Earth is spherical.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 392 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Globe illustration with world landmarks wishing for 2016 to be \"the year when people remembered that science is a method of investigation and not a belief sy..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 392"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Globe illustration with world landmarks wishing for 2016 to be \"the year when people remembered that science is a method of investigation and not a belief sy..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12973038_488663814666691_6263949441578117412_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
