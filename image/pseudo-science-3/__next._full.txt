13:T41a,Statistical probability comparison meme with playing cards image. Hand holding playing cards showing royal flush (Ace through 10 of hearts) against green card table background. Three probability statements in white text: 'The probability of getting FIVE royal flushes in a row is 0.000000000000000000000000668157876' with exponent notation '14352475950670290899384801%. If that happened, you would reasonably conclude that the game is somehow rigged.' Second: 'The probability of functional sequence of amino acids in several known proteins arising from chance is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%, or 1 in 10^63.' Third: 'The probability of a functional simple cell to arise without intelligent design, given all the ingredients is 1 in 10^57600!' Uses extremely low probability comparisons to argue biological complexity requires intelligent design, claiming random chance cannot explain protein formation or cellular origin, comparing it to impossibly unlikely card game scenarios that would indicate rigging.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-3","title":"Pseudo Science 3","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/16143146_10212397816360942_4280357342415459445_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with photograph of antique brass compass on aged map with sepia tones.
