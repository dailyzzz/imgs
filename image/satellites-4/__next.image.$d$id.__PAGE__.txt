Right column shows remote natural areas: snow-capped mountain range peaks (top), orange/tan sand dunes desert (middle), dense green forest interior (bottom left), calm blue ocean/sea water (bottom right). Bottom text: 'The Further You Travel From Highways and Cities, The Harder It Is To Get A GPS Signal. Why Doesn't \"Worldwide Coverage\" Include Mountains, Deserts, Forests, And Oceans? It's Because You're Connecting To A Land Based Cell Tower With a 50 Mile Range. SATELLITES DO NOT EXIST.' Argues GPS relies on terrestrial cell towers rather than orbiting satellites, explaining why signal is lost in remote areas without infrastructure."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
