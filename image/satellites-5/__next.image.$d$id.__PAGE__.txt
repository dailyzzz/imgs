Left column shows urban/developed areas: city skyline with purple twilight (top), busy highway with traffic (middle), suburban residential neighborhood with houses (bottom left), paved road through orange desert landscape (bottom right). Right column shows remote natural areas: snow-capped mountain range peaks (top), orange/tan sand dunes desert (middle), dense green forest interior (bottom left), calm blue ocean/sea water (bottom right). Bottom text: 'The Further You Travel From Highways and Cities, The Harder It Is To Get A GPS Signal. Why Doesn't \"Worldwide Coverage\" Include Mountains, Deserts, Forests, And Oceans? It's Because You're Connecting To A Land Based Cell Tower With a 50 Mile Range. SATELLITES DO NOT EXIST.' Argues GPS relies on terrestrial cell towers rather than orbiting satellites, explaining why signal is lost in remote areas without infrastructure."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-4","title":"Satellites 4","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37226813_2041384562775002_4209538485222113280_n.jpeg","description":"Mobile phone screenshot of Google search results showing NASA Super Pressure Balloon launch. Shows browser at google.com with search interface (ALL, IMAGES, VIDEOS, NEWS, MAPS tabs). Main result shows large white inflated balloon being prepared on ground with yellow launch equipment/crane, people working, mountains in background. Google result labeled 'NASA' with title 'NASA Super Pressure Balloon Begins Globetrotting Journey | ...' and subtitle 'Scientific Balloons · Super Pressure Balloon launch'. Copyright notice and 'RELATED IMAGES' section visible with thumbnail images. Bottom shows related NASA.gov result. Image suggests NASA uses high-altitude balloons for atmospheric research, potentially conflated with orbital satellites in flat Earth arguments.

Search interface shows tabs (ALL, IMAGES, VIDEOS, NEWS, MAPS). Results display 5x5 grid of 25+ satellite images: various CGI renderings and artistic illustrations of satellites with solar panels orbiting Earth, ISS, communications satellites, GPS satellites, all showing polished 3D computer-generated appearance rather than actual photographs. Blue Earth with white clouds visible in many images. Black space backgrounds. Multiple duplicate or similar-looking satellite designs. Suggests all publicly available satellite imagery is computer-generated illustrations rather than authentic space photography, questioning existence or accessibility of real satellite photographs."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
