5:Tcd5,Apollo 11 moon landing hoax claims collage showing alleged impossibilities. Three-panel infographic questioning authenticity of Apollo 11 lunar landing photographs. Title banner across top in italicized serif font on gold/tan background: 'Apollo 11' (left) and 'IMPOSSIBILITIES' (right). Top left panel shows gold/tan background with black text: 'Module's Descent Engine with a thrust of up to 5 tons LEFT NO LANDING CRATER'. Top center displays iconic Apollo 11 Lunar Module photograph on moon's surface. Gold-foil wrapped descent stage with ladder visible, four landing pads resting on gray lunar regolith. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible on lunar surface. American flag planted nearby. Surface shows gray moon dust with footprints. Black sky above. Scene shows characteristic harsh lighting and shadows from unfiltered sunlight. Top right panel on gold/tan background states: 'LANDING FOOT WITH NO TRACE OF MOON DUST' (likely lowered by a crane in place on the movie set)' - parenthetical suggests film set rather than moon. Bottom left shows close-up photograph of Lunar Module descent stage from below - golden-foil thermal insulation with 'UNITED STATES' text visible, structural supports, thruster bells pointing downward. Harsh shadows visible on surface below. No visible blast crater beneath engine despite claimed 5-ton thrust. Bottom center shows 'Deesillustration.com' watermark. Bottom right displays close-up photograph of LM landing pad foot - circular dish-shaped foot covered in crinkled gold foil, approximately 3 feet diameter. Pad sits on gray lunar surface with disturbed regolith around it showing compression pattern. Surrounding surface appears dusty and disturbed but landing pad itself appears relatively clean without thick coating of dust. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Collage presents common moon landing hoax arguments: 1) Descent engine's 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust should have created crater in lunar surface, 2) Landing pads should be covered in moon dust blown during landing. However, both claims misunderstand lunar conditions: 1) Lunar surface is hard compacted regolith beneath thin dust layer - not soft like beach sand. Engine throttled down to ~3,000 lbf during final descent to reduce impact. Exhaust dispersed across wide area creating shallow depression visible in photos but not deep crater. Vacuum environment means no air to create turbulent blast. 2) Dust WAS disturbed during landing (visible in film footage as spray radiating outward), but in vacuum with no air resistance, dust particles followed ballistic trajectories away from landing site rather than settling back on pads. Some dust accumulated but not thick coating. Landing pads show expected appearance given vacuum environment physics. Multiple independent analyses of Apollo photos, lunar samples (842 pounds returned), retroreflectors placed on moon still used for laser ranging, testimony from 400,000 NASA workers, verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary tracking missions), satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible all confirm moon landings occurred. Photograph analysis claiming 'impossibilities' misunderstands lunar environment physics or applies Earth-based intuitions to airless low-gravity conditions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 326 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo 11 moon landing hoax claims collage showing alleged impossibilities.
