13:Tcd5,Apollo 11 moon landing hoax claims collage showing alleged impossibilities. Three-panel infographic questioning authenticity of Apollo 11 lunar landing photographs. Title banner across top in italicized serif font on gold/tan background: 'Apollo 11' (left) and 'IMPOSSIBILITIES' (right). Top left panel shows gold/tan background with black text: 'Module's Descent Engine with a thrust of up to 5 tons LEFT NO LANDING CRATER'. Top center displays iconic Apollo 11 Lunar Module photograph on moon's surface. Gold-foil wrapped descent stage with ladder visible, four landing pads resting on gray lunar regolith. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible on lunar surface. American flag planted nearby. Surface shows gray moon dust with footprints. Black sky above. Scene shows characteristic harsh lighting and shadows from unfiltered sunlight. Top right panel on gold/tan background states: 'LANDING FOOT WITH NO TRACE OF MOON DUST' (likely lowered by a crane in place on the movie set)' - parenthetical suggests film set rather than moon. Bottom left shows close-up photograph of Lunar Module descent stage from below - golden-foil thermal insulation with 'UNITED STATES' text visible, structural supports, thruster bells pointing downward. Harsh shadows visible on surface below. No visible blast crater beneath engine despite claimed 5-ton thrust. Bottom center shows 'Deesillustration.com' watermark. Bottom right displays close-up photograph of LM landing pad foot - circular dish-shaped foot covered in crinkled gold foil, approximately 3 feet diameter. Pad sits on gray lunar surface with disturbed regolith around it showing compression pattern. Surrounding surface appears dusty and disturbed but landing pad itself appears relatively clean without thick coating of dust. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Collage presents common moon landing hoax arguments: 1) Descent engine's 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust should have created crater in lunar surface, 2) Landing pads should be covered in moon dust blown during landing. However, both claims misunderstand lunar conditions: 1) Lunar surface is hard compacted regolith beneath thin dust layer - not soft like beach sand. Engine throttled down to ~3,000 lbf during final descent to reduce impact. Exhaust dispersed across wide area creating shallow depression visible in photos but not deep crater. Vacuum environment means no air to create turbulent blast. 2) Dust WAS disturbed during landing (visible in film footage as spray radiating outward), but in vacuum with no air resistance, dust particles followed ballistic trajectories away from landing site rather than settling back on pads. Some dust accumulated but not thick coating. Landing pads show expected appearance given vacuum environment physics. Multiple independent analyses of Apollo photos, lunar samples (842 pounds returned), retroreflectors placed on moon still used for laser ranging, testimony from 400,000 NASA workers, verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary tracking missions), satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible all confirm moon landings occurred. Photograph analysis claiming 'impossibilities' misunderstands lunar environment physics or applies Earth-based intuitions to airless low-gravity conditions14:Tba8,Star trail long-exposure photograph showing circular patterns around celestial pole. Spectacular astrophotography image capturing hours of star movement through long-exposure time-lapse technique. Sky dominates frame showing hundreds of circular concentric star trails in vibrant colors - blue, cyan, teal, green, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple creating rainbow spectrum effect. Star trails form perfect circular arcs centered on point slightly left of center representing celestial pole (approximately where Polaris, North Star, is located). Each trail represents single star's apparent path across sky as Earth rotates. Trails range from tight circles near pole to wider arcs farther away. Colors indicate different star temperatures and atmospheric effects. Longer trails suggest hours-long exposure (likely 2-4+ hours). Center point shows slight gap where Polaris itself appears as small circle rather than point. Lower portion shows terrestrial landscape - silhouette of bare dead tree with branching limbs standing prominently against colorful sky on right side. Tree appears leafless with gnarled angular branches creating stark black profile. Left side shows silhouettes of smaller trees or bushes creating dark horizon line. Body of water (lake or river) visible as dark calm surface in foreground reflecting faint colors. Rocky or earthen shore visible in immediate foreground on right. Horizon shows gradient of warm colors - orange, yellow fading into darker blue-green above suggesting photograph captured from sunset through night into dawn, or twilight period. Lower left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white sans-serif font. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community shares star trail photographs claiming circular motion around fixed point proves stars rotate above stationary flat Earth rather than Earth rotating beneath stars. However, star trails actually demonstrate Earth's rotation. From Northern Hemisphere, stars appear to circle Polaris because observer on rotating Earth sees celestial sphere appear to rotate in opposite direction. Polaris sits nearly aligned with Earth's rotational axis, so appears stationary while other stars trace circles around it. Southern Hemisphere observers see stars circle southern celestial pole (no bright pole star there). This phenomenon only makes sense on rotating sphere - if Earth were stationary disc with local rotating dome of stars, different mechanism would be required and observers at different locations would see different centers of rotation, which they don't. Star trail photography used by astronomers for centuries to demonstrate and measure Earth's rotation rate. Circular patterns prove spherical rotating Earth, not flat stationary plane. Foucault pendulum provides complementary evidence - pendulum's swing plane rotates due to Earth's rotation beneath it. Both phenomena demonstrate same physical reality: Earth rotates on axis once per ~23.93 hours (sidereal day)15:Ta9f,Facebook notification meme showing social media activity explosion after discovering flat Earth. Humorous meme depicting dramatic increase in Facebook notifications after becoming flat Earth believer. Blue Facebook-themed background mimics social media interface. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'BEFORE DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Upper section shows Facebook interface elements in darker blue silhouette style: left shows two-person icon (friends/people), center shows speech bubble icon (messages), right shows globe/world icon (notifications) with small red notification badge showing number '7' suggesting minimal activity. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'AFTER DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Lower section shows same three Facebook icons but with dramatically increased notification numbers in bright orange-red badges: friends icon shows '419', messages icon shows '91', globe/notifications icon shows '134' - representing exponential increase in social media engagement. Meme humorously captures experience of flat Earth believers who become extremely active in online debates and discussions. After discovering flat Earth theory, person presumably begins posting about it frequently, leading to flood of responses from friends, family, and strangers. High notification counts suggest: 1) Friend requests or tags from other flat Earthers (419), 2) Direct messages from people debating or questioning beliefs (91), 3) Post notifications from intense comment threads (134). Meme resonates because flat Earth believers often report becoming consumed by topic, spending hours in online debates, watching conspiracy videos, joining Facebook groups, commenting on mainstream science posts. Controversial beliefs naturally generate engagement - mix of fellow believers providing encouragement and skeptics offering counterarguments. Many report losing friendships or facing social consequences but finding new community among fellow believers. Humorous tone suggests self-awareness about obsessive engagement. Format reflects reality that conspiracy theory beliefs often accompanied by intense online activity - researching 'evidence', sharing memes, debating critics, seeking validation from like-minded individuals. Social media algorithms may amplify this by showing more flat Earth content once user engages with it, creating echo chamber effect. Psychology research shows conspiracy theory believers often form tight-knit online communities where shared marginalized beliefs create strong social bonds. Meme functions as both self-deprecating humor and implicit brag about dedication to 'truth-seeking' despite social pushback9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-326","title":"Other 326","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795283_471213729745033_7497933477636279075_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-325","title":"Other 325","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12794964_473340079532398_4010653388263023867_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-327","title":"Other 327","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795299_468758903323849_6910434711150921852_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
