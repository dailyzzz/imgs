Right side shows photograph of clear glass cylinder containing multiple colored liquid layers stacked by density (from top to bottom: lamp oil, rubbing alcohol, vegetable oil, water, dish soap, milk, 100% maple syrup, corn syrup, honey) with various objects suspended at different levels (ping pong ball at top, soda cap, beads, cherry tomato, die, popcorn kernel, bolt at bottom).
