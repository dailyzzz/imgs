Left side asks 'Why do some objects float and others sink?' with two bullet points: 'If an object has a density lower than that of the surrounding liquid or gas, it will float' and 'OPPOSITE: If an object has a density higher than that of the liquid or gas, it will sink'. Right side shows photograph of clear glass cylinder containing multiple colored liquid layers stacked by density (from top to bottom: lamp oil, rubbing alcohol, vegetable oil, water, dish soap, milk, 100% maple syrup, corn syrup, honey) with various objects suspended at different levels (ping pong ball at top, soda cap, beads, cherry tomato, die, popcorn kernel, bolt at bottom). Demonstrates Archimedes' principle and density stratification visually through everyday materials."},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-26","title":"Gravity 26","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/83797969_619826631925482_7708450682583384064_n.jpeg","description":"Educational physics diagram titled 'Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation' with dark background. Top section explains: 'G=6.67 x 10⁻¹¹ m³/(kg s²) this is the value of G, the gravitational constant. We call it \"Big G.\" Little g is for the pull of gravity on a particular planet or mass.' Shows comparative gravitational acceleration values: 'On Earth, g = 9.8 m/s² On the Moon, g = 1.6 m/s² On Jupiter, if there were a solid surface you could stand on, you would experience g as 21.9 m/s². This extra force would turn your 100 lbs into 236 lbs.'

Below shows g = The Acceleration Due to Gravity with value g = 9.80 m/s² (approximately!) on Earth's surface, noting 'g varies with location'.
