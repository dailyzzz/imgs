3:T5fc,Density and buoyancy diagram explaining floating objects without gravity. Shows educational physics diagram on black background with light blue fluid section at bottom. Illustrates scientific principle of buoyancy as alternative to gravitational explanation. Top section (black) shows large gray downward-pointing arrow labeled 'Density' at top. Left side displays 'm subscript object' in yellow/orange text with notation '(mass of the object)' below in orange. Yellow-orange dashed rectangle frames spherical object in center. Sphere shown in tan-beige-brown gradient showing three-dimensional shading. Sphere labeled 'ρ subscript object' with notation '(density of the object)' in gray. Sphere partially submerged at interface between black top section and light blue bottom section representing fluid. Bottom section (light blue) represents fluid medium. Lower left shows 'ρ subscript fluid' in black text with notation '(density of the fluid)' below. Bottom center displays large light blue upward-pointing arrow labeled 'Buoyancy' in white text at bottom. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in light gray. Diagram demonstrates Archimedes principle: object floats or sinks based on density relationship between object and surrounding fluid. Flat Earth proponents argue this explains rising/falling without requiring gravity - objects simply seek their natural density level in medium. Claims hot air balloons rise because hot air is less dense than cold air, not because they overcome gravitational force4:T5d2,Airplane window view of snowy landscape with flat horizon questioning denial of senses. Shows photograph taken from commercial aircraft window seat at cruising altitude (approximately 30,000-40,000 feet). View looks down and outward at winter landscape below. Lower half displays terrain with snow-covered ground creating white patches interspersed with darker forested or bare ground areas creating mottled brown-gray-white pattern. Shows valleys, hills, possible river systems creating meandering patterns through landscape. Geographic features suggest mountainous or hilly region with snow accumulation in valleys and on peaks. Upper half shows sky - gradient from darker blue at top transitioning to lighter blue-gray near horizon. Thin white cloud layer visible at middle distance. Most significant feature: horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight where land meets sky, extending across entire width of image at approximately eye level. No visible curvature despite high altitude vantage point. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark in light blue translucent text. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE'. Bottom text: 'TO DENY YOUR OWN SENSES?' Flat Earth argument emphasizes trusting direct sensory observation over scientific authority. Claims if Earth were truly spherical, curvature should be observable from airplane altitude, but horizon appears flat validating personal empirical evidence over theoretical models5:T5da,Antarctic ice shelf with false-color green terrain showing massive ice wall. Shows aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape with unusual green false-color processing. Left side and foreground dominated by bright green colored terrain representing ice shelf or Antarctic landmass - vivid lime-green to forest-green coloring creates striking artificial appearance. Green surface shows topographic features, slopes, undulations suggesting three-dimensional terrain. Center features massive white ice cliff or wall - sheer vertical face where ice shelf meets ocean or lower elevation. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Wall shows brilliant white coloring with blue-gray shadows and stratified layers visible. Some sections show irregular breaks where ice has calved. Right side and upper portion shows flat gray-white surface representing ocean, sea ice, or cloud cover extending to horizon. Surface appears uniform with slight texture. Far background displays snow-covered mountain peaks in pale blue-gray - two distinct peaks visible rising above horizon line. Sky shows light blue gradient suggesting clear polar conditions. No text or watermarks visible. Image processing likely uses satellite or aerial survey data with false-color to enhance terrain features. Green coloring helps differentiate ice elevation zones. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic ice imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter surrounding flat Earth disc0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-252","title":"Other 252","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698648_463798983819841_2655086343656313495_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-251","title":"Other 251","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698463_461734087359664_377936747346123944_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-253","title":"Other 253","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698719_461770264022713_8561603609258010225_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
