5:T5fc,Density and buoyancy diagram explaining floating objects without gravity. Shows educational physics diagram on black background with light blue fluid section at bottom. Illustrates scientific principle of buoyancy as alternative to gravitational explanation. Top section (black) shows large gray downward-pointing arrow labeled 'Density' at top. Left side displays 'm subscript object' in yellow/orange text with notation '(mass of the object)' below in orange. Yellow-orange dashed rectangle frames spherical object in center. Sphere shown in tan-beige-brown gradient showing three-dimensional shading. Sphere labeled 'ρ subscript object' with notation '(density of the object)' in gray. Sphere partially submerged at interface between black top section and light blue bottom section representing fluid. Bottom section (light blue) represents fluid medium. Lower left shows 'ρ subscript fluid' in black text with notation '(density of the fluid)' below. Bottom center displays large light blue upward-pointing arrow labeled 'Buoyancy' in white text at bottom. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in light gray. Diagram demonstrates Archimedes principle: object floats or sinks based on density relationship between object and surrounding fluid. Flat Earth proponents argue this explains rising/falling without requiring gravity - objects simply seek their natural density level in medium. Claims hot air balloons rise because hot air is less dense than cold air, not because they overcome gravitational force0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 252 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Density and buoyancy diagram explaining floating objects without gravity.
