Top illustration shows curved line representing Earth's curvature with points labeled 'B' on left and 'A' on right. Curved arc between them labeled '5 miles' showing height of arc. Straight line distance across top of arc labeled '6 miles'. Diagram includes small structures at points B and A (possibly buildings or observation points) labeled with 'C' above. Bottom illustration shows flat horizontal line between same points B and A with straight '6 miles' distance labeled, representing flat Earth model. Visual demonstrates geometric difference: on curved surface, straight-line distance (6 miles) differs from arc length, while on flat surface they would be same. Illustrates how curvature should create measurable difference in distances if Earth is spherical versus flat"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-124","title":"Other 124","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12307440_439888942877512_731251387358927024_o.jpg","description":"Dramatic seascape photograph with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text overlay in large bold white letters across lower third. Shows powerful ocean scene with dark gray storm clouds dominating upper half of image. Brilliant golden-orange sunlight breaks through gaps in clouds creating dramatic crepuscular rays (god rays) streaming down through atmosphere. Rays appear to converge and diverge from breaks in cloud cover. Middle section shows darker gray clouds with bright yellow-orange illumination behind them. Lower portion shows calm blue-gray ocean water extending to horizon line. Horizon appears perfectly flat and level where water meets sky. Image uses dramatic natural lighting and atmospheric effects to create visually striking composition supporting flat Earth messaging. Crepuscular rays create sense of sun being relatively close to Earth rather than 93 million miles away"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-126","title":"Other 126","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12308608_475646285968444_7789915605264561803_n.jpg","description":"Tropic Thunder movie meme featuring Robert Downey Jr. as Lincoln Osiris, Black character wearing military combat helmet with camouflage pattern and chin strap. Character has unlit cigarette or toothpick in mouth, facial expression shows skeptical or questioning look with wide eyes staring at camera. Blurred green foliage background suggests jungle or forest setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN'T SEE THE CURVATURE BECAUSE THE EARTH IS TOO BIG?' Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN SEE SHIPS SAIL OVER THE HORIZON?' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters' and 'JM' logo. Meme points out perceived logical contradiction in mainstream explanation for why Earth's curvature isn't visible from ground level (too large to perceive) versus claim that ships disappearing over horizon proves curvature. Argues if Earth is too big to see curvature, horizon effects shouldn't be observable either. Uses Downey's skeptical expression to convey disbelief in contradictory reasoning"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
