3:T502,Educational indoctrination meme featuring young woman in black graduation cap and gown. Graduate has long brown hair, holds small colorful desktop globe in both hands in front of chest. Globe shows blue oceans, green/yellow/pink continents with country labels visible. Light gray/white background creates clean portrait composition. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom section shows George Orwell quote in smaller white text: '"Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me." - George Orwell' with 'fb.com/fematters' attribution below. Argues spherical Earth belief stems from childhood education indoctrination rather than personal investigation or evidence. Uses graduation imagery to symbolize completion of systematic programming. Orwell quote questions blind acceptance of scientific consensus by general public who haven't personally verified claims. Suggests educational system teaches obedience to authority rather than critical thinking4:T465,Black background with white text quote and azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map icon. Left side shows white-bordered square containing high-contrast black and white flat Earth map projection with North Pole at center, continents visible in black silhouettes against white background. Bottom left text reads 'Investigate flat earth.' in gray sans-serif font. Right side displays white text quote: 'There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation.' Attribution below: '(Herbert Spencer)' in parentheses. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo in gray. Quote from philosopher Herbert Spencer argues that dismissing ideas without investigation ensures ignorance. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests people reject flat Earth theory due to prejudice rather than genuine examination of evidence. Argues mainstream dismissal of flat Earth is emotional/social conformity rather than rational scientific evaluation. Calls for open-minded investigation before forming conclusions5:T4cd,Satirical composite image showing massive crowd bowing in worship toward giant inflatable globe above US Capitol building. Shows green lawn of National Mall with hundreds of people in various colored clothing (blue, green, white, black, yellow, purple shirts) all bowing forward on hands and knees in prayer/prostration position facing Capitol. White neoclassical US Capitol building with iconic dome visible in background under blue sky with white clouds. Trees line sides of scene. Massive light blue inflatable globe balloon hovers/floats above Capitol building showing South America continent prominently in brown/green. Globe appears weathered or patched. Top right watermark 'fb.com/fematters' and 'JM' logo. Bottom text in huge bold white letters: 'BALLIEVERS'. Satirical portage compares belief in spherical Earth to religious worship/idolatry. 'Ballievers' is pun on 'ball' (sphere) and 'believers', suggesting globe Earth acceptance is faith-based rather than evidence-based. Image mocks those who accept mainstream cosmology as unquestioning devotees engaged in quasi-religious submission to false god (globe Earth). Crowd's uniform bowing suggests herd mentality and social conformity rather than independent thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-146","title":"Other 146","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439456_474835499382856_8730171841154972512_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-145","title":"Other 145","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439156_451896538343419_2749766266179285728_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-147","title":"Other 147","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440282_476185589247847_4628853777349366684_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
