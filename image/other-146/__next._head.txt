5:T502,Educational indoctrination meme featuring young woman in black graduation cap and gown. Graduate has long brown hair, holds small colorful desktop globe in both hands in front of chest. Globe shows blue oceans, green/yellow/pink continents with country labels visible. Light gray/white background creates clean portrait composition. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom section shows George Orwell quote in smaller white text: '"Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me." - George Orwell' with 'fb.com/fematters' attribution below. Argues spherical Earth belief stems from childhood education indoctrination rather than personal investigation or evidence. Uses graduation imagery to symbolize completion of systematic programming. Orwell quote questions blind acceptance of scientific consensus by general public who haven't personally verified claims. Suggests educational system teaches obedience to authority rather than critical thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 146 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational indoctrination meme featuring young woman in black graduation cap and gown.
