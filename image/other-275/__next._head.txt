5:T849,Flat Earth cosmology electromagnetic spectrum diagram with sun and moon frequencies. Educational diagram showing visible light spectrum in context of flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Main section on black background divided into vertical colored bands representing rainbow spectrum from red to violet. Top row shows seven circles representing celestial bodies: Six labeled 'SUN' in gradually changing yellow-cream tones corresponding to color below, plus one labeled 'MOON' in white/pale yellow over purple band. Below circles, white section labeled 'FREQUENCY INTERVAL' lists specific frequencies: 480 THz (terahertz), 510 THz, 540 THz, 610 THz, 670 THz, 750 THz reading left to right under respective colors. Middle shows white waveform illustrations overlaid on spectrum demonstrating increasing frequency - waves become more compressed (shorter wavelength) moving left to right. Arrows indicate 'INCREASING ENERGY' pointing right and 'INCREASING WAVELENGTH' pointing left. Bottom dark section labeled 'WAVELENGTH INTERVAL' shows corresponding wavelengths: 635 nm (nanometers), 590 nm, 560 nm, 490 nm, 450 nm, 400 nm. Color bands progress: deep red/maroon (left), brown/orange, olive/yellow-green, bright green, cyan/turquoise, blue, deep blue/purple, violet (right). Lower beige border shows 'SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION'. Diagram attempts to connect sun's light to specific frequencies and wavelengths in flat Earth model, suggesting sun emits light at different frequencies that we perceive as colors. Also includes moon in spectrum implying moon generates its own light. However, scientifically: Sun emits broad continuous spectrum (blackbody radiation ~5778K) containing all visible wavelengths simultaneously, not discrete frequencies. Moon doesn't generate light - reflects sunlight. Listed frequencies/wavelengths are correct for visible spectrum (red ~700nm/430THz to violet ~400nm/750THz), but diagram misrepresents how sun and moon relate to spectrum. Real sun emits across entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, with peak in visible range0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 275 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth cosmology electromagnetic spectrum diagram with sun and moon frequencies.
