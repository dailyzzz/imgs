3:T849,Flat Earth cosmology electromagnetic spectrum diagram with sun and moon frequencies. Educational diagram showing visible light spectrum in context of flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Main section on black background divided into vertical colored bands representing rainbow spectrum from red to violet. Top row shows seven circles representing celestial bodies: Six labeled 'SUN' in gradually changing yellow-cream tones corresponding to color below, plus one labeled 'MOON' in white/pale yellow over purple band. Below circles, white section labeled 'FREQUENCY INTERVAL' lists specific frequencies: 480 THz (terahertz), 510 THz, 540 THz, 610 THz, 670 THz, 750 THz reading left to right under respective colors. Middle shows white waveform illustrations overlaid on spectrum demonstrating increasing frequency - waves become more compressed (shorter wavelength) moving left to right. Arrows indicate 'INCREASING ENERGY' pointing right and 'INCREASING WAVELENGTH' pointing left. Bottom dark section labeled 'WAVELENGTH INTERVAL' shows corresponding wavelengths: 635 nm (nanometers), 590 nm, 560 nm, 490 nm, 450 nm, 400 nm. Color bands progress: deep red/maroon (left), brown/orange, olive/yellow-green, bright green, cyan/turquoise, blue, deep blue/purple, violet (right). Lower beige border shows 'SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION'. Diagram attempts to connect sun's light to specific frequencies and wavelengths in flat Earth model, suggesting sun emits light at different frequencies that we perceive as colors. Also includes moon in spectrum implying moon generates its own light. However, scientifically: Sun emits broad continuous spectrum (blackbody radiation ~5778K) containing all visible wavelengths simultaneously, not discrete frequencies. Moon doesn't generate light - reflects sunlight. Listed frequencies/wavelengths are correct for visible spectrum (red ~700nm/430THz to violet ~400nm/750THz), but diagram misrepresents how sun and moon relate to spectrum. Real sun emits across entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, with peak in visible range4:T819,Large azimuthal equidistant projection map displayed on urban building. Photograph showing massive world map displayed on exterior wall of multi-story building in city setting. Map uses azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole - same projection commonly used by flat Earth community. Map appears as large circular disc with white/cream border showing compass directions with decorative sun symbols at cardinal points. North Pole at center (white) with continents radiating outward. Africa prominently displayed in orange/brown tones center-left. Asia in yellow-green tones across upper portion. Europe visible in smaller scale. North and South America in green tones on right side. Australia in yellow-orange lower portion. Antarctica not shown as continent - outer ring represents Antarctic region. Map shows political boundaries with countries in different colors. Ocean areas in light blue. Latitude/longitude grid lines visible as black curves radiating from center and concentric circles. Map appears to be large advertisement, mural, or educational display mounted on concrete/glass building facade. Building shows modern architecture with visible windows, air conditioning units. Street level visible at bottom showing pedestrians walking on sidewalk - approximately 6-8 people visible as small figures giving scale to massive map (appears 30-40 feet in diameter). Yellow taxi cab motion-blurred in foreground driving past on street. Street lamp and traffic infrastructure visible. Background shows more urban buildings. Sky appears overcast/hazy typical of city atmosphere. Map projection is legitimate cartographic tool used for aviation and radio communication because it accurately shows distances from center point. United Nations logo uses this projection. However, flat Earth community adopted this specific projection as 'true' map of Earth, misunderstanding that it's 2D representation of 3D sphere, not actual Earth shape. Projection severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center - Australia, South America, Antarctica appear stretched5:T83f,Australian surfer riding gravitational wave meme playing on upside-down Australia trope. Meme combining gravitational wave physics concept with flat Earth southern hemisphere joke. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'AUSTRALIAN MAN SURFS'. Image shows spectacular action surfing photograph taken from above showing surfer carving turn on large ocean wave. Surfer wears red wetsuit or rashguard with white/tan surfboard visible beneath feet. Wave shows beautiful turquoise-blue water with white foam spray arcing dramatically from surfer's turn creating crescent-shaped curtain of water. Surrounding ocean displays deep blue color with rippled texture. Photograph captures dynamic moment mid-maneuver showing skill and power. Foam and spray create artistic patterns in water. Lighting suggests sunny conditions with clear visibility. Perspective from directly above or slightly elevated gives bird's-eye view of surfing action. Bottom text: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme works on multiple levels: 1) References 2016 gravitational waves detection making science news, 2) Plays on 'upside-down Australia' joke where people in southern hemisphere are allegedly upside down on globe Earth, 3) Visual pun where curved arc of water spray resembles wave/waveform in physics sense. Flat Earth context: In flat Earth model, 'down' is same direction everywhere (toward disc), so Australia isn't upside down. Globe skeptics mock idea that Australians stand upside down (misunderstanding of gravity - 'down' means toward Earth's center from any surface point). Gravitational waves reference adds physics joke since flat Earth community rejects Einstein's relativity and gravitational wave detection. Meme suggests Australian's orientation on globe requires gravitational waves to stay attached. However, gravity pulls toward planetary center regardless of surface location - no special force needed. On sphere, all surface dwellers experience 'down' as toward core. Australian surfer experiences same gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²) as surfer anywhere else0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-275","title":"Other 275","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717757_464902123709527_7235288575083781581_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-274","title":"Other 274","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717740_465255460340860_1563648932534546304_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-276","title":"Other 276","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717831_463501427182930_424940914684462304_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
