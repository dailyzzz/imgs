5:T4d4,Portrait photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with quote overlay. Shows Einstein in his later years with characteristic wild white hair, gray mustache and goatee, deep facial wrinkles showing age and wisdom. Wearing dark gray suit jacket and light blue collared shirt. Hands clasped together in contemplative gesture near face. Warm brown/sepia background gives thoughtful atmosphere. Einstein gazes slightly off-camera with gentle, knowing expression. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo. White text overlay at bottom reads: '"I have come to believe that the motion of the Earth cannot be detected by any optical experiment."— Albert Einstein'. Quote taken from Einstein's work on relativity, suggesting Earth's motion through space is undetectable through direct observation. Flat Earth proponents use this quote to argue if motion cannot be detected, perhaps Earth is stationary rather than moving through space. Context: Einstein's actual point was about relative motion and frames of reference in special/general relativity, not Earth being stationary. Quote mined to support flat Earth perspective by implying scientific authority (Einstein) acknowledged problems with Earth's supposed motion0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 143 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Portrait photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with quote overlay.
