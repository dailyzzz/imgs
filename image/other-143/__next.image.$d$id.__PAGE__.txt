3:T4d4,Portrait photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with quote overlay. Shows Einstein in his later years with characteristic wild white hair, gray mustache and goatee, deep facial wrinkles showing age and wisdom. Wearing dark gray suit jacket and light blue collared shirt. Hands clasped together in contemplative gesture near face. Warm brown/sepia background gives thoughtful atmosphere. Einstein gazes slightly off-camera with gentle, knowing expression. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo. White text overlay at bottom reads: '"I have come to believe that the motion of the Earth cannot be detected by any optical experiment."— Albert Einstein'. Quote taken from Einstein's work on relativity, suggesting Earth's motion through space is undetectable through direct observation. Flat Earth proponents use this quote to argue if motion cannot be detected, perhaps Earth is stationary rather than moving through space. Context: Einstein's actual point was about relative motion and frames of reference in special/general relativity, not Earth being stationary. Quote mined to support flat Earth perspective by implying scientific authority (Einstein) acknowledged problems with Earth's supposed motion4:T760,Historical newspaper article from Oamaru Mail, Volume XXVII, Issue 8305, dated 11 June 1904. Green header banner reads 'New Astronomical Theories' with subtitle 'Oamaru Mail, Volume XXVII, Issue 8305, 11 June 1904.' Article titled 'New Astronomical Theories' discusses flat Earth theory proposed by Mr. M'Clelland. Text excerpt: 'A correspondent in an American paper, writing from St. Catherines, Ontario, says it is asserted that on the Niagara peninsula, the truth still of Canada of which town is the centre, five out of six persons believe that the sun we live on is flat, and not spherical; and one of the proponents of the theory is John S. M'Clelland, city clerk of St. Catherines, formerly editor of a daily newspaper here. Mr M'Clelland is well educated and has made an earnest study of astronomy. After much investigation he concluded that the earth floats on water instead of air; that the sun is no bigger than it looks to the naked eye, and is only a few thousand miles above the earth. The sun, Mr M'Clelland thinks, rises from the ocean to shine on the world forth above it. The sun's intensity is not sufficient to heat the whole mass at once, and thus when it is at one end of the world the other end darkness and ice is accounted for. Mr M'Clelland points to the fact that the sun and moon are both seen shining at the same time, as unanswerable evidence that the earth is not a ball-like in shape. He scouts the gravitation theory. There Dr Hamilton of some sort draws, just like magnets. Another theory is merely an invention of astronomers to try to get out of a hole, as he calls it, that the earth is a globe.' Article continues discussing M'Clelland's theories about gravity, moon phases, and challenges to heliocentric model. Describes debate with Hamilton astronomer about whether Earth is flat. Historical documentation of early 20th century flat Earth advocacy5:T491,Historical black and white photograph from 1955 showing Admiral Richard E. Byrd in television interview setting. Two men seated in dark leather chairs - left figure (civilian) wearing dark suit, glasses, and bow tie holds notepad, appears to be interviewer. Right figure (Admiral Byrd) wears light-colored military dress uniform with rank insignia, medals and decorations visible on chest. Behind them on wall is large azimuthal equidistant map projection showing flat Earth model with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map clearly visible above 'ATLANTIC OCEAN' text. Bottom text overlay: 'ADMIRAL BYRD IN FRONT OF AN AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT MAP - 1955'. Getty Images watermark 'NBC NewsWire' visible. Bottom corner shows '1450110923' and 'memes.com'. Admiral Byrd was famous polar explorer who led expeditions to Antarctica. Flat Earth proponents cite his use of azimuthal equidistant projection as evidence he knew true shape of Earth. However, this map projection is standard for polar navigation/aviation regardless of belief in spherical Earth.
