3:Tba8,Star trail long-exposure photograph showing circular patterns around celestial pole. Spectacular astrophotography image capturing hours of star movement through long-exposure time-lapse technique. Sky dominates frame showing hundreds of circular concentric star trails in vibrant colors - blue, cyan, teal, green, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple creating rainbow spectrum effect. Star trails form perfect circular arcs centered on point slightly left of center representing celestial pole (approximately where Polaris, North Star, is located). Each trail represents single star's apparent path across sky as Earth rotates. Trails range from tight circles near pole to wider arcs farther away. Colors indicate different star temperatures and atmospheric effects. Longer trails suggest hours-long exposure (likely 2-4+ hours). Center point shows slight gap where Polaris itself appears as small circle rather than point. Lower portion shows terrestrial landscape - silhouette of bare dead tree with branching limbs standing prominently against colorful sky on right side. Tree appears leafless with gnarled angular branches creating stark black profile. Left side shows silhouettes of smaller trees or bushes creating dark horizon line. Body of water (lake or river) visible as dark calm surface in foreground reflecting faint colors. Rocky or earthen shore visible in immediate foreground on right. Horizon shows gradient of warm colors - orange, yellow fading into darker blue-green above suggesting photograph captured from sunset through night into dawn, or twilight period. Lower left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white sans-serif font. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community shares star trail photographs claiming circular motion around fixed point proves stars rotate above stationary flat Earth rather than Earth rotating beneath stars. However, star trails actually demonstrate Earth's rotation. From Northern Hemisphere, stars appear to circle Polaris because observer on rotating Earth sees celestial sphere appear to rotate in opposite direction. Polaris sits nearly aligned with Earth's rotational axis, so appears stationary while other stars trace circles around it. Southern Hemisphere observers see stars circle southern celestial pole (no bright pole star there). This phenomenon only makes sense on rotating sphere - if Earth were stationary disc with local rotating dome of stars, different mechanism would be required and observers at different locations would see different centers of rotation, which they don't. Star trail photography used by astronomers for centuries to demonstrate and measure Earth's rotation rate. Circular patterns prove spherical rotating Earth, not flat stationary plane. Foucault pendulum provides complementary evidence - pendulum's swing plane rotates due to Earth's rotation beneath it. Both phenomena demonstrate same physical reality: Earth rotates on axis once per ~23.93 hours (sidereal day)4:Tb52,Child blocking ears meme with Professor Brian Cox social media post about blocking conspiracy theorists. Internet meme showing frustrated child combined with screenshot mocking physicist Brian Cox's response to conspiracy theorists. Top text in large bold white outlined letters on light background: 'WHEN YOU CAN'T DEBATE THE GLOBE SO ALL YOU HAVE ARE INSULTS'. Main image shows young boy (approximately 7-10 years old) making exaggerated frustrated expression with eyes squeezed tightly shut, mouth open showing teeth in grimace of annoyance. Both hands raised with index fingers plugged into ears in classic 'I can't hear you' gesture - childish way of blocking out unwanted information. Child wears black t-shirt. White background suggests studio photograph or isolated image. Expression and pose convey refusal to listen, shutting out opposing viewpoints, immature response to disagreement. Lower portion shows Facebook post screenshot. Profile picture shows person wearing winter hat/beanie. Name reads 'Professor Brian Cox' with timestamp '9 hrs' and globe icon indicating public post. Post text reads: 'Amusing myself by blocking everyone who thinks either moon landings fake or Earth flat #futilegesturesthatneverthelessmakeushappy'. Hashtag references futile but satisfying actions. Right side shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution in black box. Meme criticizes Professor Brian Cox (British physicist, TV presenter, professor at University of Manchester, known for science communication programs like 'The Universe' and 'Human Universe') for blocking flat Earth believers and moon landing deniers rather than engaging in debate. Positions his blocking as childish refusal to discuss evidence, equivalent to child plugging ears. Implies Cox can't defend globe Earth through reasoned argument so resorts to blocking/insults. However, Cox likely blocked users not due to inability to debate, but because: 1) Professional scientists receive overwhelming volume of conspiracy theory comments making meaningful discussion impossible, 2) Most social media flat Earth debates involve bad-faith arguments, moving goalposts, rejection of evidence, 3) Cox has addressed these topics extensively in his programs and books with evidence, 4) Sometimes blocking is appropriate boundary-setting rather than admission of defeat. Cox is accomplished physicist who regularly explains evidence for spherical Earth, space exploration, physics of planetary formation. His decision to block persistent conspiracy theorists represents time management rather than inability to debate. Meme tries to position blocking as weakness when it may be reasonable response to unproductive repeated arguments. However, format resonates because condescending dismissal without engagement can feel unsatisfying to those genuinely questioning. Balance needed between patient education and boundary-setting with bad-faith actors5:Tcd5,Apollo 11 moon landing hoax claims collage showing alleged impossibilities. Three-panel infographic questioning authenticity of Apollo 11 lunar landing photographs. Title banner across top in italicized serif font on gold/tan background: 'Apollo 11' (left) and 'IMPOSSIBILITIES' (right). Top left panel shows gold/tan background with black text: 'Module's Descent Engine with a thrust of up to 5 tons LEFT NO LANDING CRATER'. Top center displays iconic Apollo 11 Lunar Module photograph on moon's surface. Gold-foil wrapped descent stage with ladder visible, four landing pads resting on gray lunar regolith. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible on lunar surface. American flag planted nearby. Surface shows gray moon dust with footprints. Black sky above. Scene shows characteristic harsh lighting and shadows from unfiltered sunlight. Top right panel on gold/tan background states: 'LANDING FOOT WITH NO TRACE OF MOON DUST' (likely lowered by a crane in place on the movie set)' - parenthetical suggests film set rather than moon. Bottom left shows close-up photograph of Lunar Module descent stage from below - golden-foil thermal insulation with 'UNITED STATES' text visible, structural supports, thruster bells pointing downward. Harsh shadows visible on surface below. No visible blast crater beneath engine despite claimed 5-ton thrust. Bottom center shows 'Deesillustration.com' watermark. Bottom right displays close-up photograph of LM landing pad foot - circular dish-shaped foot covered in crinkled gold foil, approximately 3 feet diameter. Pad sits on gray lunar surface with disturbed regolith around it showing compression pattern. Surrounding surface appears dusty and disturbed but landing pad itself appears relatively clean without thick coating of dust. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Collage presents common moon landing hoax arguments: 1) Descent engine's 10,000 lbf (45 kN) thrust should have created crater in lunar surface, 2) Landing pads should be covered in moon dust blown during landing. However, both claims misunderstand lunar conditions: 1) Lunar surface is hard compacted regolith beneath thin dust layer - not soft like beach sand. Engine throttled down to ~3,000 lbf during final descent to reduce impact. Exhaust dispersed across wide area creating shallow depression visible in photos but not deep crater. Vacuum environment means no air to create turbulent blast. 2) Dust WAS disturbed during landing (visible in film footage as spray radiating outward), but in vacuum with no air resistance, dust particles followed ballistic trajectories away from landing site rather than settling back on pads. Some dust accumulated but not thick coating. Landing pads show expected appearance given vacuum environment physics. Multiple independent analyses of Apollo photos, lunar samples (842 pounds returned), retroreflectors placed on moon still used for laser ranging, testimony from 400,000 NASA workers, verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary tracking missions), satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible all confirm moon landings occurred. Photograph analysis claiming 'impossibilities' misunderstands lunar environment physics or applies Earth-based intuitions to airless low-gravity conditions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-325","title":"Other 325","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12794964_473340079532398_4010653388263023867_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-324","title":"Other 324","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792190_471789219687484_3939437447536827211_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-326","title":"Other 326","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795283_471213729745033_7497933477636279075_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
