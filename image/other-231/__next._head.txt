5:T5b1,Challenger crew comparison photo suggesting survivors. Shows official 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger STS-51-L crew photograph in black and white. Seven astronauts in NASA flight suits pose in two rows - four standing in back row, three kneeling in front holding helmets. American flag with stars visible upper left. Crew members wear blue NASA jumpsuits with mission patches, name tags. Shuttle model visible bottom left. Image overlaid with circular insets showing color photographs of faces - several crew members have white-bordered circular photos superimposed showing older individuals allegedly identified as same people decades later. Top text reads: 'The "Challenger crew"- 30 years on?' One circle contains only question mark suggesting missing person. Conspiracy theory claims Challenger crew members survived 1986 explosion and are living under different identities. Proponents point to people with similar names and appearances working in academia and other fields. Arguments cite lack of visible aging in some cases, similar facial features, matching names. However, investigation shows these are different people with coincidentally similar names. Theory suggests Challenger disaster was staged false flag event. Mainstream history confirms all seven crew members perished when external tank exploded 73 seconds after launch on January 28, 1986. Debris and remains were recovered. Families held funerals. Theory disrespects victims and families0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 231 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Challenger crew comparison photo suggesting survivors.
