5:T43d,Educational meme about the Nile River with aerial photograph and wordplay. Header 'THE NILE' in white text, followed by green text: 'A RIVER THAT FLOWS NORTH OVER 4,000 MILES AGAINST THE SUPPOSED CURVE OF THE GLOBE. THIS IMPOSSIBILITY FURTHER PROVES THE EARTH IS FLAT AND WATER ALWAYS FLOWS DOWNHILL TO FIND ITS LEVEL'. Main image shows stunning aerial view of winding Nile River cutting through green landscape with agricultural fields visible on both sides. River appears as bright blue meandering path through lush green terrain under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom section shows large text 'DE-NIAL' (pun on 'denial' and 'the Nile'), followed by smaller text 'WHEN YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THIS FACT AND CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU LIVE ON A GIANT SPINNING BALL'. Photo credit 'Nick Havok'. Argues that Nile River flowing northward for 4,000+ miles contradicts spherical Earth model because water should not be able to flow 'uphill' over curved surface. Claims river's ability to flow such distance proves Earth is flat plane where water simply flows downhill following gravity to seek level0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 12 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational meme about the Nile River with aerial photograph and wordplay.
