3:T43d,Educational meme about the Nile River with aerial photograph and wordplay. Header 'THE NILE' in white text, followed by green text: 'A RIVER THAT FLOWS NORTH OVER 4,000 MILES AGAINST THE SUPPOSED CURVE OF THE GLOBE. THIS IMPOSSIBILITY FURTHER PROVES THE EARTH IS FLAT AND WATER ALWAYS FLOWS DOWNHILL TO FIND ITS LEVEL'. Main image shows stunning aerial view of winding Nile River cutting through green landscape with agricultural fields visible on both sides. River appears as bright blue meandering path through lush green terrain under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom section shows large text 'DE-NIAL' (pun on 'denial' and 'the Nile'), followed by smaller text 'WHEN YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THIS FACT AND CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU LIVE ON A GIANT SPINNING BALL'. Photo credit 'Nick Havok'. Argues that Nile River flowing northward for 4,000+ miles contradicts spherical Earth model because water should not be able to flow 'uphill' over curved surface. Claims river's ability to flow such distance proves Earth is flat plane where water simply flows downhill following gravity to seek level4:T428,Three-panel soccer ball meme demonstrating water retention on different surfaces. Top panel shows inflated white soccer ball with classic black pentagon pattern on grass, labeled 'BALL DOESN'T HOLD WATER'. Middle panel shows same ball completely deflated and collapsed inward, wrinkled white leather with black patches visible, labeled 'BUT A FLAT BALL DOES'. Bottom panel shows completely flattened deflated ball pressed flat on dark surface, black panels spread out in irregular pattern. Humorous analogy arguing that spherical surfaces don't retain water (water runs off curved ball), but flat surfaces do hold water (deflated flat ball could theoretically hold water like shallow dish). Applies this observation to Earth: if Earth were spherical like inflated ball, oceans should run off curved surface, but since water stays in place, Earth must be flat like deflated ball. Uses everyday object (soccer ball) to make intuitive argument about water behavior on curved versus flat surfaces, suggesting flat Earth better explains water retention than globe model0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-12","title":"Water Level 12","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/23519351_376084966173386_5095148856683849441_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-11","title":"Water Level 11","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18447588_125962204632470_7584539329049491921_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme showing identical ocean scenes with different labels. Both panels display same photograph of deep blue ocean with small two-masted sailboat on horizon under light blue sky with scattered white clouds. Top panel labeled 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in black text. Bottom panel labeled 'NOT SEA CURVE' in black text. Images appear identical, emphasizing point that ocean surface appears perfectly flat and level at horizon, not curved. Simple visual argument that terminology 'sea level' accurately describes observable reality (flat/level water surface), while 'sea curve' would be inaccurate description since no visible curvature can be observed. Uses wordplay to highlight that even mainstream terminology acknowledges water's levelness. Sailboat provides scale reference showing distant horizon appears as straight flat line where ocean meets sky, with no visible drop or curvature despite distance"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-13","title":"Water Level 13","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/30582401_10213503635522657_7296528551136722944_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
