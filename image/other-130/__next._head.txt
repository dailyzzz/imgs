Instead of 'NASA' text, large white letters spell 'LIARS' in NASA's signature font style. Red vector/chevron swoosh crosses diagonally through circle matching NASA logo design. Top text in light blue reads 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' in clean sans-serif font. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text with 'fb.com/fematters' social media handle below. Perfect mimicry of NASA's logo design language but replacing agency name with accusation of dishonesty. Implies space agency deliberately deceives public about Earth's shape and nature of space. Encourages independent research into flat Earth theory.
