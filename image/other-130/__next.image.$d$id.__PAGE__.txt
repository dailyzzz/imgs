3:T41b,Satirical composite image showing 'Earthrise' from moon with Disney theme. Bottom half shows gray lunar surface with craters and rough terrain in black and white, mimicking famous Apollo moon photographs. Upper half shows black space. Rising above lunar horizon is light blue children's inflatable globe ball decorated with Disney characters - Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy positioned around globe with playful poses. Globe shows simplified world map with 'WALT DISNEY WORLD' text visible. Bottom right shows NASA logo altered with red slash and 'LIARS' text. Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical image mocking NASA's Apollo Earthrise photographs by replacing majestic Earth with cheap Disney toy globe, suggesting NASA's space imagery is as authentic as children's cartoon globes. Implies moon landings were staged theatrical productions, comparing NASA to Disney entertainment company. Uses Mickey Mouse iconography to suggest space program is fantasy/fiction for children rather than legitimate science0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-130","title":"Other 130","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321512_479749088891497_152611109440113677_n.jpg","description":"Parody of iconic NASA logo on black background. Shows circular blue sphere (representing Earth or space) with white orbital ring/swoosh and white stars scattered across surface. Instead of 'NASA' text, large white letters spell 'LIARS' in NASA's signature font style. Red vector/chevron swoosh crosses diagonally through circle matching NASA logo design. Top text in light blue reads 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' in clean sans-serif font. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text with 'fb.com/fematters' social media handle below. Perfect mimicry of NASA's logo design language but replacing agency name with accusation of dishonesty. Implies space agency deliberately deceives public about Earth's shape and nature of space. Encourages independent research into flat Earth theory. Visual rhetoric uses authority and recognition of NASA branding to undermine that same authority by calling them liars"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-129","title":"Other 129","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12316390_439178006281939_392989869745422685_n.jpg","description":"Stunning aerial sunset photograph taken from airplane window showing view over engine nacelle/cowling. 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in large bold white letters at top. White curved airplane engine cowling visible in lower left foreground. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level extending across entire width of image where dark ocean or land meets sky. Sky shows spectacular gradient from deep blue-purple at top transitioning through lighter blue in middle to brilliant orange-yellow-red sunset colors at horizon. Thin bright orange-red band marks exact horizon line. Colors create natural ombre effect. Ocean or landscape below appears as dark blue-gray mass. Image taken at high altitude (30,000+ feet). Despite high altitude view, horizon appears completely flat with no visible curvature, which flat Earth proponents use as evidence against spherical Earth. Argues human eye should detect curvature at commercial flight altitudes if Earth were globe. Beautiful natural colors contrast with controversial message"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-131","title":"Other 131","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321694_487124251487314_3168701071416758240_n.jpg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
