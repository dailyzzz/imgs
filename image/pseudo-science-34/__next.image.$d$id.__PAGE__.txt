3:T4bb,Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipment. Background shows green chalkboard covered with white chemical formulas and equations (CH³, HB₃, Log, Ph²). Foreground displays colorful chemistry glassware: conical flasks with blue, red/orange, clear liquids, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers with colored solutions on wooden lab bench. Top text in large white letters: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED'. Bottom text: 'THAT YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED.' Satirical meta-commentary on public trust in scientific authority and announcements. Can be interpreted multiple ways: critique of blind faith in science without understanding methodology, skepticism about sensationalized science journalism, or anti-science sentiment questioning all scientific findings. In flat Earth context, used to argue people uncritically accept mainstream scientific claims (like globe Earth) without personal verification. Ironically, meme itself relies on comedic appeal rather than reasoned argument, using cute cat to make philosophical point about epistemology and trust in expert authority.4:T5b3,Meme featuring iconic black and white close-up photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with characteristic wild white hair, mustache, and beard, wearing tweed jacket, looking directly at camera with penetrating gaze and slight expression. Top text in large white letters with black outline: 'I CONCLUDED THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY ANY OPTICAL EXPERIMENT.' Bottom text: 'BUT JUST IGNORE THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO USE MY OTHER THEORIES TO PROVE THE GLOBE' with 'mematic.net' watermark. Quote references Einstein's discussion of principle of relativity - that uniform motion cannot be detected through optical experiments conducted within moving reference frame (basis of special relativity). Meme presents this as contradiction: if Einstein admitted Earth's motion cannot be optically detected, how can his other theories (general relativity, spacetime curvature) prove spherical Earth? Misrepresents Einstein's work: inability to detect absolute motion doesn't mean Earth is stationary, rather that all inertial reference frames are equivalent and motion is relative. Einstein fully accepted heliocentric model and Earth's spherical shape; his relativity theories explain why uniform motion is undetectable while maintaining Earth orbits Sun. Selective quote mining to create false inconsistency in Einstein's work, ignoring that relativity theory reconciles experimental results with Earth's motion through relative reference frames concept.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-34","title":"Pseudo Science 34","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/49482117_2302257723138301_8409580767687999488_n.jpeg","description":"Black and white historical photograph of Louis Pasteur seated in formal Victorian-era attire with quote overlay reading 'Little science takes you away from God but more of it takes you to Him.' attributed to '-Louis Pasteur the founder of microbiology and immunology.'"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-33","title":"Pseudo Science 33","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/48412960_2290666314297442_5016630150867976192_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-35","title":"Pseudo Science 35","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/49896135_2202232179815287_3727622684796780544_n-1.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
