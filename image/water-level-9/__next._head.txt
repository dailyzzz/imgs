Bottom third shows photograph of deep blue ocean with small white sailboat on horizon line under light blue sky with white clouds. Photo credit 'Nick Havok' in bottom left corner. Presents syllogistic argument: if water demonstrably doesn't curve (as observable in containers, lakes, oceans), and Earth's surface is 70% water, then Earth must be flat rather than spherical. Uses mathematical equation format to present logical deduction from two premises to conclusion. Combines observable property of water (always seeks level) with Earth's composition to conclude planet must be flat plane. Sailboat photograph emphasizes flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, supporting visual claim of non-curved water surface extending to distance"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Water Level 9"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Simple logic meme with gradient blue background showing ocean scene.
