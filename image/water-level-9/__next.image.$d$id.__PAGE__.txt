3:T455,Four-panel educational meme titled 'ALL THESE THINGS' at top and 'CANNOT WORK ON THE GLOBE' at bottom. Top left shows submarine periscope emerging from calm ocean water with label 'PERISCOPE'. Top right shows lighthouse on rocky coast during stormy weather with label 'LIGHTHOUSE'. Bottom left shows mechanical gyroscope device with labeled parts: 'Gyroscope frame', 'Spin axis', 'Gimbal', and 'Rotor' with label 'GYROSCOPE'. Bottom right shows sundial on grass with shadow cast by sun with label 'SUNDIAL'. Argues these four technologies only function properly on flat Earth: periscopes work because water is level allowing straight-line viewing; lighthouses are visible beyond supposed curvature distance; gyroscopes maintain orientation without accounting for Earth's rotation; sundials work using sun's movement rather than Earth's rotation. Claims these practical instruments prove flat, stationary Earth and would fail or require compensation if Earth were rotating sphere. Questions why navigation and timekeeping tools designed for flat plane work perfectly without adjusting for curvature or rotation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-9","title":"Water Level 9","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18402805_125962337965790_3495852714320985349_n.jpeg","description":"Simple logic meme with gradient blue background showing ocean scene. Top two-thirds displays white text in equation format: 'WATER DOESN'T CURVE + EARTH IS 70% WATER = EARTH IS FLAT' using large bold letters with black outlines. Bottom third shows photograph of deep blue ocean with small white sailboat on horizon line under light blue sky with white clouds. Photo credit 'Nick Havok' in bottom left corner. Presents syllogistic argument: if water demonstrably doesn't curve (as observable in containers, lakes, oceans), and Earth's surface is 70% water, then Earth must be flat rather than spherical. Uses mathematical equation format to present logical deduction from two premises to conclusion. Combines observable property of water (always seeks level) with Earth's composition to conclude planet must be flat plane. Sailboat photograph emphasizes flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, supporting visual claim of non-curved water surface extending to distance"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-8","title":"Water Level 8","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/16266229_10212397836681450_3016190395013929116_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-10","title":"Water Level 10","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18402993_1403563083015348_933471735534434861_n.jpeg","description":"Meme featuring person standing in shallow ocean water wearing blue tie-dye or gradient shirt, facing camera with serious expression. Ocean horizon visible in background with calm blue water and light cloudy sky. Top text reads 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND.' Middle text states 'AND WATER ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL.' Bottom text asks 'SO WTF IS CURVING?' with red text credit 'SHADOW THUNDERCLOUD'. Person appears to be partially submerged up to waist/chest level in water. Presents logical argument: if water naturally seeks level (demonstrable physical property), and Earth is 71% water, then Earth's surface should be predominantly flat/level rather than curved. Questions how majority-water planet can have curved surface when water's fundamental property is to maintain level horizontal surface. Uses ocean backdrop to emphasize vast quantities of supposedly level water covering Earth"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
