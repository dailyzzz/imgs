3:T5c9,Missing milk carton parody featuring Earth's missing curvature. Shows 3D rendered illustration of classic red and white milk carton design against plain white background. Carton displays traditional gable-top shape with triangular peaked roof and small rectangular tab at top. Left side panel shows vertical red and white stripes with large red text 'MILK' repeated vertically. Front panel features missing person poster format with red header 'MISSING' at top. Below header shows black band with white text 'CURVATURE'. Center displays photograph of Earth from space - classic Blue Marble style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents visible against black space background. Bottom right of photo shows 'JM' signature watermark. Below photo, red text reads 'Have you Seen me?' in friendly font. Lower section contains mock missing person details in black italicized text: 'LAST SPOTTED ON NEVER' with 'NEVER' emphasized. Next line: 'IF FOUND: PLEASE CONTACT NASA' with 'NASA' in capital letters. Final line: 'REWARD: CREDIBILITY' with 'CREDIBILITY' in capital letters. Left panel shows vertical text reading 'HOMOGENIZED PASTEURIZED' in red. Satirical image mocks inability to observe Earth's curvature from ground level despite spherical Earth model. Suggests curvature is theoretical construct never actually witnessed in reality. 'Reward: Credibility' implies finding observable curvature would restore NASA's trustworthiness4:T63b,Antarctic tabular ice shelf with geometric cliff faces meeting dark ocean. Shows stunning aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf from elevated viewpoint. Lower right foreground displays pristine white snow-covered ice shelf surface extending across bottom of frame - flat geometric plane with slight undulations and surface textures visible. Most dramatic feature is massive vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets ocean - clean straight edge running across image showing sheer drop from flat top surface to water level. Ice cliff appears 50-100 feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified horizontal layers of compressed ice and snow in brilliant white and pale blue bands. Wall face shows some irregularities, cracks, overhangs, and icicle-like formations along edge where ice has partially calved. Left side and upper portion shows dark teal-blue ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, and small white icebergs floating on surface creating textured pattern. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast against bright white ice. Middle distance shows larger tabular icebergs and ice floes in various sizes. Far background displays distant ice shelf formations extending to horizon. Sky shows light blue-gray gradient suggesting overcast polar conditions. Bottom left corner shows 'www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk' watermark indicating British Antarctic Survey photography. No other text visible. Professional nature documentation. Image used by flat Earth proponents as visual representation of alleged Antarctic ice wall surrounding flat Earth disc perimeter5:T604,Apollo command module water training mockingly labeled as gravitational waves. Shows vintage NASA training photograph at outdoor facility. Large white Apollo command module mockup floating in bright turquoise-blue swimming pool. Module displays conical shape with gray heat shield base, white upper section, small windows visible, yellow equipment or framework attached to top. Pool appears to be large rectangular training tank with concrete edges. Multiple people in water - several wearing light-colored flight suits or training gear floating on yellow inflatable rafts positioned around module. One person appears to be practicing water egress procedures. Another person swimming in water. Personnel on pool deck visible in background wearing white shirts. Background shows brown fence, utility poles, power lines, open flat landscape suggesting desert or coastal training facility (likely Ellington Field or similar NASA site). Sky shows overcast gray-blue conditions. Lower left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom center shows large white text with black outline: 'GRAVITY WAVES'. Image satirizes 2016 LIGO gravitational wave detection announcement by showing literal water waves in NASA training pool. Moon landing skeptics point to Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory underwater training as evidence spacewalk footage was filmed in pools rather than space. Suggests 'gravity waves' are just water ripples from astronaut pool training rather than cosmic phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general relativity0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-248","title":"Other 248","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698243_464898840376522_6791307062651726646_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-247","title":"Other 247","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697381_461770147356058_5884868133883643800_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-249","title":"Other 249","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698457_465227530343653_6140738402944405606_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
