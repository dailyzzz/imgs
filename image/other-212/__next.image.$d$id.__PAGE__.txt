3:T590,Neil deGrasse Tyson meme with 'pear-anoia' pun about Earth's shape. Shows Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and science communicator, in professional portrait against plain gray-green gradient background. Tyson wears dark navy blue suit jacket, light blue dress shirt, dark blue tie with small pattern or planets/stars design. Has characteristic wide friendly smile showing teeth, short dark hair with gray at sides, thin mustache. Both hands raised toward camera with palms facing outward in emphatic gesture or stop motion. Gold ring visible on finger. Body language suggests enthusiastic explanation or demonstration. Translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark visible across chest area. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'PEAR-ANOIA WILL DESTROYA'. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature watermark. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is not perfect sphere but actually 'pear-shaped' or 'oblate spheroid' - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator. Flat Earth community mocked this statement, claiming it shows inconsistency in official narrative (sometimes sphere, sometimes pear, sometimes oblate spheroid). Pun combines 'pear' + 'paranoia' suggesting Tyson's pear-shaped Earth claims will ultimately destroy credibility of mainstream astronomy. Word 'destroya' suggests Tyson's own statements undermine the globe Earth model through contradictions and overcomplications4:T5a0,Halloween skeleton decorations meme about waiting for globe Earth proof. Shows exterior daytime photograph of gray-blue house with white trim. Wooden steps/stairs leading up to doorway entrance with screen door. Multiple plastic Halloween skeleton decorations arranged on and around stairs in various waiting poses. Approximately 8-10 realistic-looking beige-white skeleton figures positioned as if sitting, standing, leaning against railings and walls in patient, bored poses. One skeleton sits hunched over on steps, another stands with arms raised, several lean against white wooden railing and siding. Green foliage/trees visible left side. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'FLATEARTHERS WAITING FOR PROOF'. Center shows small 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT WE LIVE ON A SPINNING BALL'. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Self-aware humor from flat Earth community acknowledging mainstream perception that they're stubbornly waiting for impossible proof. Skeleton imagery suggests they've been waiting so long they've died and decomposed - represents endless wait. Ironically reverses burden of proof argument - while mainstream science has provided extensive evidence for spherical rotating Earth, flat Earthers claim they're still waiting for satisfactory proof. Suggests no amount of evidence will convince them. Humor disarms criticism by embracing the waiting skeleton metaphor5:T58b,Scumbag Steve meme criticizing physics evidence for globe Earth. Shows young man in indoor setting wearing tan/brown sideways scumbag hat, white t-shirt. Has somewhat dazed or smug facial expression looking slightly off-camera. Background shows beige/tan walls, Christmas tree visible with decorations and lights, typical residential interior. Light coloring and composition create casual, candid photo aesthetic. Top text in white bold Impact font with black outline: 'BELIEVES PHYSICS OFFERS EVIDENCE OF GLOBE EARTH'. Bottom left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in same font style: 'CAN'T PROVIDE ANY'. Bottom left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Uses Scumbag Steve meme format (originated 2011) depicting naive, hypocritical, or annoying person making contradictory claims. Criticizes globe Earth believers who claim physics proves spherical Earth but allegedly cannot provide convincing demonstrations. Flat Earth argument suggests mainstream science relies on abstract mathematics and theories rather than direct observable proof. Implies physics models are mathematical constructs that don't necessarily reflect reality. Questions concepts like gravity, orbital mechanics, centrifugal force as unproven assumptions rather than demonstrated facts. Reverses burden of proof by suggesting those who believe in globe model cannot actually explain or prove the physics they claim supports it0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-212","title":"Other 212","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12640333_458537694345970_2693304563078920792_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-211","title":"Other 211","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633746_460550940811312_5807645605894336062_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-213","title":"Other 213","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12642488_461070304092709_2267447020385932588_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
