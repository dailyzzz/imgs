5:T590,Neil deGrasse Tyson meme with 'pear-anoia' pun about Earth's shape. Shows Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and science communicator, in professional portrait against plain gray-green gradient background. Tyson wears dark navy blue suit jacket, light blue dress shirt, dark blue tie with small pattern or planets/stars design. Has characteristic wide friendly smile showing teeth, short dark hair with gray at sides, thin mustache. Both hands raised toward camera with palms facing outward in emphatic gesture or stop motion. Gold ring visible on finger. Body language suggests enthusiastic explanation or demonstration. Translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark visible across chest area. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'PEAR-ANOIA WILL DESTROYA'. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature watermark. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is not perfect sphere but actually 'pear-shaped' or 'oblate spheroid' - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator. Flat Earth community mocked this statement, claiming it shows inconsistency in official narrative (sometimes sphere, sometimes pear, sometimes oblate spheroid). Pun combines 'pear' + 'paranoia' suggesting Tyson's pear-shaped Earth claims will ultimately destroy credibility of mainstream astronomy. Word 'destroya' suggests Tyson's own statements undermine the globe Earth model through contradictions and overcomplications0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 212 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Neil deGrasse Tyson meme with 'pear-anoia' pun about Earth's shape.
