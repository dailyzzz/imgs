3:T4cd,Satirical composite image showing massive crowd bowing in worship toward giant inflatable globe above US Capitol building. Shows green lawn of National Mall with hundreds of people in various colored clothing (blue, green, white, black, yellow, purple shirts) all bowing forward on hands and knees in prayer/prostration position facing Capitol. White neoclassical US Capitol building with iconic dome visible in background under blue sky with white clouds. Trees line sides of scene. Massive light blue inflatable globe balloon hovers/floats above Capitol building showing South America continent prominently in brown/green. Globe appears weathered or patched. Top right watermark 'fb.com/fematters' and 'JM' logo. Bottom text in huge bold white letters: 'BALLIEVERS'. Satirical portage compares belief in spherical Earth to religious worship/idolatry. 'Ballievers' is pun on 'ball' (sphere) and 'believers', suggesting globe Earth acceptance is faith-based rather than evidence-based. Image mocks those who accept mainstream cosmology as unquestioning devotees engaged in quasi-religious submission to false god (globe Earth). Crowd's uniform bowing suggests herd mentality and social conformity rather than independent thinking4:T502,Educational indoctrination meme featuring young woman in black graduation cap and gown. Graduate has long brown hair, holds small colorful desktop globe in both hands in front of chest. Globe shows blue oceans, green/yellow/pink continents with country labels visible. Light gray/white background creates clean portrait composition. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU BELIEVE IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TAUGHT IT IN SCHOOL'. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom section shows George Orwell quote in smaller white text: '"Just why do we believe that the earth is round? I am not speaking of the few thousand astronomers, geographers and so forth who could give ocular proof, or have a theoretical knowledge of the proof, but of the ordinary newspaper-reading citizen, such as you or me." - George Orwell' with 'fb.com/fematters' attribution below. Argues spherical Earth belief stems from childhood education indoctrination rather than personal investigation or evidence. Uses graduation imagery to symbolize completion of systematic programming. Orwell quote questions blind acceptance of scientific consensus by general public who haven't personally verified claims. Suggests educational system teaches obedience to authority rather than critical thinking5:T488,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to look downwards at the horizon'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-147","title":"Other 147","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440282_476185589247847_4628853777349366684_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-146","title":"Other 146","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439456_474835499382856_8730171841154972512_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-148","title":"Other 148","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440454_455797657953307_2589827333278940772_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
