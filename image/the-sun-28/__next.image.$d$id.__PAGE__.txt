Top section contains white text: 'Heliocentric is the model where the earth goes around the sun. The term was first used by the Pathagorean cult in 200 BC after it returned to Greece from Egypt. Helios in the ancient Egyptian is Horus, the sun god. Centric means center. So heliocentric means centered on the god Horus. We are being taught a 2200 year old cultic, math worshiping religion as science.' Bottom section shows large red text 'And this doesn't concern you at all?' alongside orrery-style physical model with yellow sun sphere, green/turquoise planetary spheres on wire orbital paths mounted on stand. References provided: 'http://www.edenics.net/english-word-origins.aspx?word=HELIOCENTRIC' and 'http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html'. Argues heliocentric model has occult/religious origins tied to ancient Egyptian sun worship, suggesting scientific astronomy is disguised paganism rather than empirical science"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-27","title":"The Sun 27","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36795489_10216135389641222_5604780129113866240_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel educational diagram comparing Eratosthenes' measurement method with solar eclipse geometry. Top panel titled 'Parallel rays of sunlight' shows curved Earth with blue surface labeled 'Alexandria'. Red parallel sun rays from right hit Earth's curved surface at angle, with two vertical sticks/gnomons shown: one casting shadow in Alexandria, another upright in Syene (no shadow). Angle 'α' marked between vertical stick and sun ray. Demonstrates Eratosthenes' 240 BC method of measuring Earth's circumference using shadow angles. Large yellow text reads 'Eratosthenes vs. Eclipse'. Bottom panel titled 'Converging rays of sunlight' shows solar eclipse diagram with sun (left), moon casting shadow cone toward Earth (right), labeled with 'PARTIAL ECLIPSE', 'TOTAL ECLIPSE', 'UMBRA', 'PENUMBRA', 'MOON', 'EARTH', with orbital paths marked. Compares parallel sun rays (used by Eratosthenes, assuming distant sun) with converging rays during eclipse, questioning consistency of solar distance model"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-29","title":"The Sun 29","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36998512_10211342512538466_844150391527440384_n.jpeg","description":"Philosophical meme questioning perception and belief about Earth's shape using sunset imagery. Shows beautiful sunset photograph over ocean with bright white-yellow sun low on horizon, golden reflection path stretching across dark reddish-brown water toward viewer. Sky displays dramatic gradient from warm peachy-yellow near sun through deeper orange to reddish-brown tones higher up with layered clouds. Top white text reads 'Only lifelong indoctrination can make a person see a sunset like this' and bottom text states 'And still believe we live on this!' with inset spherical Earth image (showing Americas, white clouds, blue oceans) in lower right corner. Argues that accepting spherical Earth despite observing flat horizon at sunset requires cultural conditioning/indoctrination rather than direct observation. Suggests visual evidence of flat horizon contradicts sphere model, implying people have been taught to ignore sensory evidence in favor of heliocentric worldview"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
