5:T832,Ken Jeong angry teacher meme about flat Earth researchers. Popular meme format using actor Ken Jeong's character Mr. Chow or similar role showing exaggerated frustration. Image shows Asian man (appears to be Ken Jeong) in classroom setting wearing maroon/burgundy shirt. He has intense angry expression with eyes squinted shut, mouth open yelling, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. Right hand raised to side of head holding small white piece of paper or note in pinched fingers. Expression suggests extreme exasperation or rage. Background shows blurred green chalkboard/blackboard suggesting classroom or teaching environment. Body language indicates theatrical overreaction to something said. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO RESEARCH FLAT EARTH'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text: 'BEFORE THEY GET UPSET AND START TELLING ME I'M WRONG'. Meme format typically used for 'Here's a list of people who...' jokes where list is very short (single small paper) or nonexistent. In this context, suggests flat Earthers get immediately defensive when their beliefs challenged, refusing to accept contrary evidence. Implies flat Earth believers haven't actually researched topic before committing to belief - they became emotionally invested first, then get angry when contradicted rather than examining evidence objectively. Common criticism of conspiracy theorists: strong emotional reactions to challenges rather than calm logical discourse. However, many flat Earthers claim extensive research led them to conclusion - countless YouTube videos, forums, books, experiments (though often flawed methodology or confirmation bias). Meme captures frustration of debunkers who present evidence (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, time zones, seasons, circumnavigation, satellite communications) only to face angry dismissal rather than rational discussion. Ken Jeong's over-the-top expression amplifies comedic effect suggesting disproportionate emotional response to simple facts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 281 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Ken Jeong angry teacher meme about flat Earth researchers.
