3:T832,Ken Jeong angry teacher meme about flat Earth researchers. Popular meme format using actor Ken Jeong's character Mr. Chow or similar role showing exaggerated frustration. Image shows Asian man (appears to be Ken Jeong) in classroom setting wearing maroon/burgundy shirt. He has intense angry expression with eyes squinted shut, mouth open yelling, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. Right hand raised to side of head holding small white piece of paper or note in pinched fingers. Expression suggests extreme exasperation or rage. Background shows blurred green chalkboard/blackboard suggesting classroom or teaching environment. Body language indicates theatrical overreaction to something said. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO RESEARCH FLAT EARTH'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text: 'BEFORE THEY GET UPSET AND START TELLING ME I'M WRONG'. Meme format typically used for 'Here's a list of people who...' jokes where list is very short (single small paper) or nonexistent. In this context, suggests flat Earthers get immediately defensive when their beliefs challenged, refusing to accept contrary evidence. Implies flat Earth believers haven't actually researched topic before committing to belief - they became emotionally invested first, then get angry when contradicted rather than examining evidence objectively. Common criticism of conspiracy theorists: strong emotional reactions to challenges rather than calm logical discourse. However, many flat Earthers claim extensive research led them to conclusion - countless YouTube videos, forums, books, experiments (though often flawed methodology or confirmation bias). Meme captures frustration of debunkers who present evidence (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, time zones, seasons, circumnavigation, satellite communications) only to face angry dismissal rather than rational discussion. Ken Jeong's over-the-top expression amplifies comedic effect suggesting disproportionate emotional response to simple facts4:T811,Artistic eye crying Earth teardrop about belief versus evidence. Digitally manipulated artistic photograph with philosophical message about cognitive bias. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence,'. Image shows close-up of human eye - most of image in black and white/grayscale showing detailed eye with long dark eyelashes, visible eye texture, wrinkled eyelid. Eye itself digitally enhanced with vivid colors: iris shows striking emerald green with teal-blue inner ring, both featuring radial pattern emanating from dark black pupil. White sclera bright and clear. Small white catchlight reflection in upper iris suggests light source. From lower eyelid, single large teardrop falls - this teardrop digitally composited to show spherical globe Earth. Teardrop displays photorealistic Earth image showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (visible: Asia, Australia, Africa, South America), white cloud formations, appearing as miniature planet encased in water droplet. Light refracts through teardrop creating slight distortion. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text continues quote: 'it's based on a deep seated need to believe.' Quote describes confirmation bias and emotional investment in beliefs independent of evidence. In flat Earth context, ironically accuses globe Earth believers of emotional attachment rather than rational assessment. Suggests people believe spherical Earth due to psychological need for mainstream acceptance, not evidence evaluation. However, this same criticism applies to flat Earth belief - often rooted in distrust of authority, desire to feel special knowledge, religious conviction, conspiracy mindset rather than objective evidence examination. Psychological projection - attributing one's own traits to others. Spherical Earth supported by overwhelming evidence anyone can verify. Crying Earth symbolizes sadness at being rejected despite evidence. Artistic metaphor for gap between evidence and belief5:T825,Flat Earth cosmology azimuthal equidistant projection labeled as United Nations map. Artistic rendering of world map using azimuthal equidistant projection viewed from North Pole perspective. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central image shows circular map on light background (appears like marble or textured white surface) surrounded by thin black double-line border frame. Map displays Earth's continents arranged radially from center point (North Pole shown as white circle with radiating lines). Continents shown in natural colors: green for vegetation/landmasses, tan/beige for deserts, white for ice/snow (Antarctica and Greenland). Oceans in gradient turquoise-teal-blue getting darker toward outer edge. North Pole at dead center with Arctic Ocean and Greenland visible. Moving outward clockwise from top: Asia (Russia, China, Japan visible in tan-green), Africa (shown in tan-brown tones), Europe (small green landmass), North America (green, stretching along right side), South America (green-tan on lower right), Australia (visible as isolated landmass in green-tan), various Pacific islands scattered throughout ocean. Concentric circles and radial lines create latitude/longitude grid system. Small yellow dots appear at regular intervals around continents possibly representing cities or coordinate markers. Map edges fade into lighter background suggesting atmosphere or boundary. Bottom text on beige border: 'UNITED NATIONS MAP'. Projection is legitimate cartographic tool (official UN emblem uses it) designed to show accurate distances from center point - useful for radio communications, aviation planning from specific location. However, severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center. Antarctica appears as ring around entire perimeter (in reality it's continent smaller than South America). Australia and South America appear enormous. This projection does NOT prove flat Earth - it's mathematical transformation of spherical surface to 2D plane, like Mercator projection. All map projections involve distortion trade-offs0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-281","title":"Other 281","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729190_465943886938684_6995591824522989875_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-280","title":"Other 280","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729160_463934640472942_5933021468034405396_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-282","title":"Other 282","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729232_464902337042839_4150015327768630377_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
