Plaque displays flat Earth cosmology diagram on left showing three-tiered universe: Upperworld (with birds and celestial beings), Earth (central flat plane with animals like deer and cat), and Underworld (with serpents and underground creatures). Extensive descriptive text explains that first Americans were nomadic groups crossing Bering Strait from Asia to North America 30,000-8000 BC, developing permanent settlements and creating common cultural landscape. Text describes how indigenous Americans honored their ancestors through religious beliefs incorporating elements of environment, imagining world on horizontal plane with four cardinal directions honored by movements of sun, moon, and stars.
