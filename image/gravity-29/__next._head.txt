5:T4a4,Educational science diagram titled 'Archimedes Principle' with blue header and white background. Top bullet point defines: 'Archimedes Principle - The buoyant force acting in a substance in a fluid at rest is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the substance.' Shows formula 'Fᵦ = weight of displaced fluid' with red circle highlighting it, followed by 'or' and formula 'Fᵦ = ρ · g · v' with red circle around 'g', annotated with 'THIS FORMULA WAS ADDED MUCH LATER THAN ARCHIMEDES'. Bottom section shows biographical comparison with text 'THEORY OF GRAVITY DIDNT COME OUT UNTIL NEWTON'. Left shows 'Archimedes of Syracuse' with Wikipedia link noting he lived c. 287 - c. 212 BC and was Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Right shows 'Sir Isaac Newton' with PRS link noting he lived December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27 and was English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist. Right side includes diagram of beaker with ice cube showing buoyant force and water displacement. Argues that buoyancy formula containing 'g' (gravity) was added anachronistically after Newton, implying Archimedes' original principle worked without gravity concept.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 29 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational science diagram titled 'Archimedes Principle' with blue header and white background.
