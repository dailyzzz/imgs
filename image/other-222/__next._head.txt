5:T580,Earth size comparison from different distances questioning NASA consistency. Shows two space photographs on black background comparing Earth's apparent size. Top section labeled 'Earth from 240,000 miles away' shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph from Apollo 8 mission (1968) - partial Earth rising above gray lunar surface/horizon. Earth appears as blue-white crescent showing cloud patterns, oceans, partial view of planet against pure black space. Bottom section labeled 'Earth from 1,000,000 miles away' shows full disk Earth photograph - complete spherical Earth with blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents. However, image shows unusual circular hole or missing data in center revealing gray/tan surface below, making Earth appear like donut or ring. Bottom text asks: 'Any questions??' Image questions why Earth appears larger when photographed from greater distance (1 million miles) compared to closer distance (240,000 miles), violating basic perspective principles. Flat Earth skeptics use this to argue NASA photographs are inconsistent, doctored, or fabricated. The hole in center of distant Earth image particularly suspicious - could indicate image manipulation, missing data, or processing artifact. However, comparison may use different camera lenses, focal lengths, or cropping that affect apparent size. Different missions used different photographic equipment affecting field of view0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 222 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Earth size comparison from different distances questioning NASA consistency.
