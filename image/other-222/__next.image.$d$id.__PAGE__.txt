3:T580,Earth size comparison from different distances questioning NASA consistency. Shows two space photographs on black background comparing Earth's apparent size. Top section labeled 'Earth from 240,000 miles away' shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph from Apollo 8 mission (1968) - partial Earth rising above gray lunar surface/horizon. Earth appears as blue-white crescent showing cloud patterns, oceans, partial view of planet against pure black space. Bottom section labeled 'Earth from 1,000,000 miles away' shows full disk Earth photograph - complete spherical Earth with blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents. However, image shows unusual circular hole or missing data in center revealing gray/tan surface below, making Earth appear like donut or ring. Bottom text asks: 'Any questions??' Image questions why Earth appears larger when photographed from greater distance (1 million miles) compared to closer distance (240,000 miles), violating basic perspective principles. Flat Earth skeptics use this to argue NASA photographs are inconsistent, doctored, or fabricated. The hole in center of distant Earth image particularly suspicious - could indicate image manipulation, missing data, or processing artifact. However, comparison may use different camera lenses, focal lengths, or cropping that affect apparent size. Different missions used different photographic equipment affecting field of view4:T757,Lighthouse visibility argument challenging Earth curvature. Shows tall lighthouse photograph against light blue sky with white clouds. Lighthouse has distinctive tiered architecture - cylindrical red-brown brick base tower with multiple ornate balconies/galleries stacked vertically, topped with black metal lantern room and white dome cap. Seabirds flying around structure. Walkway/jetty extends from base into calm turquoise-blue ocean water. Upper left contains text block explaining flat Earth lighthouse argument: 'If, in fact, the earth were a round ball as is supposed, there is simply no way to explain how lighthouses can be seen from such great distances at sea. This phenomenon can be experienced by modern mariners today. The only interpretation of the phenomenon of being able to see lighthouses and other structures many miles out at sea is that the earth is flat. Knowledge of the fact are examples of lighthouses that could, in fact, be seen at great distances. Those lighthouses should have been well below the level curvature of the earth and thus out sight if the earth were round.' Second text block provides specific examples: 'The Egerø Light, on west point of Island, south coast of Norway, is fitted up with the first order of the dioptric lights, is visible 28 statute miles, and the altitude above high water is 154 feet. On making the proper calculation it will be found that this light ought to be sunk below the horizon 230 feet.' Third text block: 'The Dunkerque Light, on the south coast of France, is 194 feet high, and is visible 28 statute miles. The ordinary calculation shows that it ought to be 190 feet below the horizon.' Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Classic flat Earth argument claiming lighthouse visibility at distances exceeding predicted by Earth curvature calculations using standard formula 8 inches per mile squared5:T59a,Three bridge photographs demonstrating horizon as convergence line. Black background with white text header at top: 'The "horizon" is a line of convergence.' Three photographs arranged horizontally showing long bridges or causeways from driver's perspective. Left image shows aerial view of cable-stayed bridge with single tall white pylon/tower, white roadway stretching into distance over blue water, surrounded by green land. Sky gradient light to medium blue. Center image shows ground-level view driving on bridge roadway - white concrete lanes with yellow center line, gray barriers on sides, overcast sky, water visible both sides. Getty Images watermark visible. Right image shows similar ground-level bridge view - tan/beige roadway with white center line, water on both sides, light blue sky with white clouds, bridge appears to extend straight to horizon. White text at bottom: 'Not the curvature of a ball.' All three images show straight horizontal lines where water meets sky at eye level. Flat Earth argument claims what mainstream science calls 'horizon' caused by Earth's curvature is actually vanishing point where parallel lines appear to converge due to perspective, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at distance. Claims bridges appear to rise to meet horizon due to perspective compression, not because they follow Earth's curve. Argues true curve would show bridge descending away from observer0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-222","title":"Other 222","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654660_461478704051869_130185143645037755_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-221","title":"Other 221","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654551_461814537351619_2880259156299938939_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-223","title":"Other 223","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654673_463012263898513_1204418471088636272_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
