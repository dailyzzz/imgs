3:T422,Two-panel educational meme about cosmological curvature models with white background. Top text asks 'So which shape of space do you believe in?' Shows three geometric models with black gridlines: Top sphere labeled 'BALL' with 'Spherical Universe, Constant positive curvature' and notation 'Ω₀>1' with yellow boxes showing density equations 'Ω₀ = ρ/ρc' and 'ρc = 3H²/8πG' and 'ρ > ρc'. Middle shows saddle/hyperbolic shape labeled 'TOILET PAPER ROLL' with 'Hyperbolic Universe, Constant negative curvature' and 'Ω₀<1' with yellow box 'ρ < ρc'. Bottom shows flat plane labeled 'FLAT' with 'Flat Universe' and 'Ω₀=1' with yellow box 'ρ = ρc'. Bottom panel shows photograph of calm blue ocean horizon with white text 'Choose wisely.' Presents cosmological models (spherical, hyperbolic, flat universe based on density parameters) alongside literal interpretation, with ocean horizon image suggesting observable flatness supports flat universe model. Conflates cosmological curvature of spacetime with physical flatness of Earth's surface.4:T4d1,Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing glasses and priest's collar, standing at chalkboard with mathematical equations and diagrams. Top text in large white letters: 'OH, YOU LIKE THE BIG BANG THEORY?' Chalkboard shows cosmological calculations with symbols including 'e', 'M', and arrow. Bottom text in large white letters: 'THANK A CATHOLIC PRIEST' with 'quickmeme.com' watermark. Meme highlights that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître in 1927, suggesting religious origin undermines theory's scientific credibility. Often used to argue modern cosmology is religious dogma rather than empirical science, or that Catholic Church controls scientific narrative. Ironically, Lemaître was accomplished physicist whose theory was initially met with skepticism but later confirmed by observational evidence (cosmic microwave background, galactic redshift). His priesthood and scientific work were separate domains. Meme implies religious affiliation invalidates scientific contributions, ad hominem fallacy attacking messenger rather than addressing evidence for expanding universe model.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-27","title":"Pseudo Science 27","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/39027551_1827516517325001_442898797090045952_n.jpeg","description":"Meme using Renaissance portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus with dark background.

Top text in large white letters: 'COPERNICUS'. Bottom text: 'OPEN CIRCUS'. Simple pun/wordplay meme mocking Copernican heliocentric model by breaking name into 'OPEN CIRCUS', implying heliocentric astronomy is circus act or absurd performance rather than legitimate science. Dismisses Copernicus's revolutionary astronomical work through ridicule, suggesting Sun-centered solar system model is theatrical fraud.
