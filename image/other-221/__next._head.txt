5:T757,Lighthouse visibility argument challenging Earth curvature. Shows tall lighthouse photograph against light blue sky with white clouds. Lighthouse has distinctive tiered architecture - cylindrical red-brown brick base tower with multiple ornate balconies/galleries stacked vertically, topped with black metal lantern room and white dome cap. Seabirds flying around structure. Walkway/jetty extends from base into calm turquoise-blue ocean water. Upper left contains text block explaining flat Earth lighthouse argument: 'If, in fact, the earth were a round ball as is supposed, there is simply no way to explain how lighthouses can be seen from such great distances at sea. This phenomenon can be experienced by modern mariners today. The only interpretation of the phenomenon of being able to see lighthouses and other structures many miles out at sea is that the earth is flat. Knowledge of the fact are examples of lighthouses that could, in fact, be seen at great distances. Those lighthouses should have been well below the level curvature of the earth and thus out sight if the earth were round.' Second text block provides specific examples: 'The Egerø Light, on west point of Island, south coast of Norway, is fitted up with the first order of the dioptric lights, is visible 28 statute miles, and the altitude above high water is 154 feet. On making the proper calculation it will be found that this light ought to be sunk below the horizon 230 feet.' Third text block: 'The Dunkerque Light, on the south coast of France, is 194 feet high, and is visible 28 statute miles. The ordinary calculation shows that it ought to be 190 feet below the horizon.' Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Classic flat Earth argument claiming lighthouse visibility at distances exceeding predicted by Earth curvature calculations using standard formula 8 inches per mile squared0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 221 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Lighthouse visibility argument challenging Earth curvature.
