Shows sun moving in concentric circular paths over flat plane, marked with 'Tropic of Cancer 23.5°N' and 'Tropic of Capricorn 23.5°S' as circles. Center marked 'North Pole' with outer ring 'ICE WALL'. Diagram indicates 'Summer in the North' with sun in outer orbit and 'Winter in the North' with sun in tighter inner circle. Labels show '24hr Daylight' and '24hr Darkness' zones. Illustrates flat Earth model of sun's annual movement creating seasons through changing circular orbit radius rather than axial tilt, with sun remaining local and close to Earth surface, circling above flat plane between tropics throughout year"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
