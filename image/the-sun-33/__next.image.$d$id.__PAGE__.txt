3:T451,Three-part comparison meme contrasting heliocentric CGI with flat Earth sun model. Top section shows CGI planetary size comparison with text 'This CGI image destroys the Heliocentric model of a massive Sun 93 million miles away'. Large yellow sun sphere shown with Jupiter, Saturn, and smaller planets in row below with downward arrow. Blue text on sun reads 'IF THE SUN WERE ACTUALLY THIS MASSIVE AND ITS LIGHT COMING FROM THAT FAR AWAY, A SIMPLE 23° TILT OF EARTH WOULD BE INSIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THIS SCALE, AND THERE WOULD NOT EVEN BE THE SLIGHTEST TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION AROUND THIS TINY SPEC OF A PEBBLE YOU CALL EARTH'. Middle section labeled 'This is a REAL photo of the small local Sun above the Flat Earth' shows bright star-like point source with lens flare/rays against dark blue background. Bottom shows text 'Sun Hotspot' in red with arrow pointing to bright spot on flat blue surface with gradient. Caption 'Demonstrating how we have seasons and temperat fluctuation across Earth'. Argues massive distant sun cannot create seasons via 23° tilt, but small local sun creating hotspot can0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-33","title":"The Sun 33","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/44422190_1946385932149172_1826894120656830464_n.jpeg","description":"Two-part meme questioning why we don't see walls of light if sun is 93 million miles away.

Bottom section states 'DOESN'T THE LIGHT TRAVEL PAST EARTH ALSO AND WOULDN'T WE SEE WALLS OF LIGHT 360° AROUND OUR NIGHT HORIZON?' Questions why night sky is dark if sunlight travels past Earth continuously. Argues that if sun's light travels 93 million miles to reach Earth, light should continue past Earth illuminating space behind it, creating visible light walls around entire night horizon. Challenges heliocentric explanation of day/night cycle by suggesting light rays should be visible from all angles if traveling through space"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-32","title":"The Sun 32","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/44395314_1946384088816023_8846836905464037376_n.jpeg","description":"Meme using 'You Are Here' concept with Earth model to question heliocentric model physics.

According to this scale, The Sun's light from 93 million miles away would hit this tiny spec of a dot all at once It doesn't matter if you tilt the dot 23° or if you turned it 90° on its side.. There would be NO seasons and not even a temperature difference from anywhere' followed by emoji figures and 'on the Earth.' Questions how distant sun could create seasonal temperature variations and different climate zones on small Earth if sunlight arrives essentially parallel from such distance. Argues scaled model demonstrates impossibility of axial tilt creating seasons when sun is 93 million miles away, suggesting heliocentric model physics don't work at stated distances"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-34","title":"The Sun 34","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/45823317_10216085286676552_4650631716715626496_n.jpeg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
