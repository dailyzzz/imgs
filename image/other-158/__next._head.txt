5:T530,Serene sunset photograph over large body of water with superior mirage question. Shows brilliant orange-yellow sun partially visible above horizon with gray-orange clouds above. Sun creates golden reflection column stretching vertically down across calm water surface toward viewer. Sky transitions from peachy-orange near sun through tan/beige tones to darker gray at top. Multiple dark birds silhouetted in flight - one upper left, one upper right, one middle-right, one lower center. Distant city skyline visible as thin dark silhouette on horizon to left of sun. Foreground shows dark shoreline with silhouettes of people - person sitting/crouching on left, two figures standing together on right. Water appears almost mirror-smooth with gentle ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level. Large bold white text at bottom: 'SUPERIOR MIRAGE?' Questions whether sun's appearance at sunset/sunrise is optical illusion (superior mirage) caused by atmospheric refraction rather than actual position. Superior mirages occur when temperature inversions bend light rays, making objects appear higher than actual location. Flat Earth proponents question whether sun truly sets below horizon or merely appears to due to perspective and atmospheric effects, suggesting sun circles above flat plane rather than Earth rotating0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 158 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Serene sunset photograph over large body of water with superior mirage question.
