3:T530,Serene sunset photograph over large body of water with superior mirage question. Shows brilliant orange-yellow sun partially visible above horizon with gray-orange clouds above. Sun creates golden reflection column stretching vertically down across calm water surface toward viewer. Sky transitions from peachy-orange near sun through tan/beige tones to darker gray at top. Multiple dark birds silhouetted in flight - one upper left, one upper right, one middle-right, one lower center. Distant city skyline visible as thin dark silhouette on horizon to left of sun. Foreground shows dark shoreline with silhouettes of people - person sitting/crouching on left, two figures standing together on right. Water appears almost mirror-smooth with gentle ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level. Large bold white text at bottom: 'SUPERIOR MIRAGE?' Questions whether sun's appearance at sunset/sunrise is optical illusion (superior mirage) caused by atmospheric refraction rather than actual position. Superior mirages occur when temperature inversions bend light rays, making objects appear higher than actual location. Flat Earth proponents question whether sun truly sets below horizon or merely appears to due to perspective and atmospheric effects, suggesting sun circles above flat plane rather than Earth rotating4:T519,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple-lavender tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Multiple layers of pink-orange clouds create dramatic sky. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to took downwards at the horizon.' [Note: text contains typo 'took' instead of 'look']. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe5:T4c8,Dramatic ocean sunset photograph with claim about scientific proof. Shows vast dark blue-gray ocean water in foreground extending to horizon. Sky dominates upper two-thirds of image with spectacular cloud formations - dark gray storm clouds with bright pink-orange-coral illumination from setting sun breaking through gaps. Brilliant yellow-orange glow visible at horizon line creating natural backlight. Pink and orange colors reflect off cloud undersides creating dramatic atmospheric effect. Horizon appears perfectly flat where dark ocean meets illuminated sky. White text overlay in center reads: 'There is an abundance of science that has PROVED the flat earth model but nothing has ever proven curvature or a globe.' Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Makes bold empirical claim that scientific evidence supports flat Earth while no evidence proves spherical Earth or curvature. Argues burden of proof lies with globe Earth proponents to demonstrate curvature, suggesting flat appearance is default observable reality requiring no proof. Uses dramatic natural scene to create emotional appeal - viewer sees flat horizon, reinforcing message that direct observation supports flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-158","title":"Other 158","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12487091_450548285144911_6905234098492399288_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-157","title":"Other 157","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12485943_454879928045080_1353300195191586290_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-159","title":"Other 159","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489280_454501514749588_7952754270576694147_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
