3:T494,Moon landing conspiracy meme questioning photography logistics. Shows black and white photograph supposedly from Apollo moon landing. Image displays lunar surface with gray rocky/dusty terrain in foreground. Apollo Lunar Module (LM) visible in upper right with gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, distinctive angular shape, landing legs. Deep black space/sky as backdrop with no visible stars. Photograph appears taken from external vantage point on moon's surface showing both terrain and spacecraft. Top text in bold white letters: 'HERE IS A PICTURE OF JUST BEFORE NASA LANDED ON THE MOON.' Bottom text: 'THE ONLY PROBLEM IS.....WHO TOOK THE PICTURE?' Bottom right watermark 'mematic.net'. Conspiracy argument questions who photographed lunar module if astronauts were inside about to land. Suggests either photo is fake/staged or other entities were already on moon. Ignores explanation that photo could be from orbiting command module, previous missions, or remote cameras. Moon landing skeptics use photographic inconsistencies and logical questions to cast doubt on Apollo program authenticity. Implies NASA's moon landing narrative contains logical impossibilities4:T4ee,Gleason's New Standard Map of the World from 1892, famous azimuthal equidistant projection. Vintage aged paper with worn edges and stains. Top header reads 'GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD' with subtitle 'ON THE PROJECTION OF J. S. CHRISTOPHER, MODERN COLLEGE OF "IT IS" BLACKHEATH, ENGLAND.' Left side panel labeled 'LONGITUDE AND TIME CALCULATOR'. Right side shows 'PATENT ALLOWED' with list of countries and date notation. Large circular map dominates center with North Pole at center point. Continents radiate outward: pink/red (Europe, Asia portions), yellow (Asia, Australia), light green (Africa), pale yellow-green (Americas). Blue oceans with latitude/longitude grid lines. Outer ring in bright coral-pink/red marked with Roman numerals I through XII representing 24-hour time zones. Bottom shows two smaller circular diagrams labeled 'JUNE SOLSTICE' (left) and 'DECEMBER SOLSTICE' (right) illustrating seasonal sun positions. Publisher info at bottom: 'PUBLISHED BY THE BUFFALO ELECTROTYPE AND ENGRAVING CO. BUFFALO N.Y., U.S.A.' Bottom banner 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. This projection is scientifically valid for aviation/navigation but frequently cited by flat Earth proponents as historical evidence authorities once knew Earth's true flat shape5:T4cb,Astronaut helmet visor reflection with Leonardo da Vinci quote. Top half shows close-up of white space helmet with large curved visor. Reflection in visor shows Earth's horizon - flat-appearing horizon line where brown/tan landmass meets deep blue space/sky. Thin bright blue atmospheric layer visible at horizon. Black space with stars visible in background. Space suit's white fabric visible on sides with ribbed texture. Center of visor reflection shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Black background below helmet contains white italicized quote: '"If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings." ~ Leonardo da Vinci'. Quote encourages empiricism and personal observation over accepting authority. Applied to flat Earth context, argues direct observation (horizon appears flat in space) should override scientific authority (Earth is sphere). Uses da Vinci's reputation as Renaissance polymath to legitimize questioning mainstream science. Suggests astronauts' own observations from space would reveal flat Earth if not constrained by NASA narrative0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-171","title":"Other 171","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12508904_455108838022189_6170034040395692587_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-170","title":"Other 170","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12507547_455544007978672_592590146440083155_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-172","title":"Other 172","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12509638_461855387347534_1925348195871509269_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
