5:T494,Moon landing conspiracy meme questioning photography logistics. Shows black and white photograph supposedly from Apollo moon landing. Image displays lunar surface with gray rocky/dusty terrain in foreground. Apollo Lunar Module (LM) visible in upper right with gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, distinctive angular shape, landing legs. Deep black space/sky as backdrop with no visible stars. Photograph appears taken from external vantage point on moon's surface showing both terrain and spacecraft. Top text in bold white letters: 'HERE IS A PICTURE OF JUST BEFORE NASA LANDED ON THE MOON.' Bottom text: 'THE ONLY PROBLEM IS.....WHO TOOK THE PICTURE?' Bottom right watermark 'mematic.net'. Conspiracy argument questions who photographed lunar module if astronauts were inside about to land. Suggests either photo is fake/staged or other entities were already on moon. Ignores explanation that photo could be from orbiting command module, previous missions, or remote cameras. Moon landing skeptics use photographic inconsistencies and logical questions to cast doubt on Apollo program authenticity. Implies NASA's moon landing narrative contains logical impossibilities0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 171 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Moon landing conspiracy meme questioning photography logistics.
