5:T409,Meme criticizing popular science communicators Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye. Shows split image with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson on left wearing dark suit with yellow tie, gesturing with hands while speaking, with blurred colorful bokeh background. Right side shows Bill Nye in brown/tan jacket holding microphone with serious expression. Top text in bold white letters: 'YOU MIGHT BE A SHEEPLE IF...' Bottom text states 'YOU BELIEVE A FAILED ACTOR AND FAILED COMEDIAN ARE SCIENTISTS.' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Attacks credibility of mainstream science popularizers by dismissing their scientific credentials and reducing them to entertainment backgrounds. References Bill Nye's background as comedian/TV personality and Neil deGrasse Tyson's media presence. Uses 'sheeple' (sheep + people) insult suggesting those who trust these figures are blindly following authority without critical thinking. Implies mainstream science education is entertainment propaganda rather than legitimate scientific discourse0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 132 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Meme criticizing popular science communicators Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye.
