3:T409,Meme criticizing popular science communicators Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye. Shows split image with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson on left wearing dark suit with yellow tie, gesturing with hands while speaking, with blurred colorful bokeh background. Right side shows Bill Nye in brown/tan jacket holding microphone with serious expression. Top text in bold white letters: 'YOU MIGHT BE A SHEEPLE IF...' Bottom text states 'YOU BELIEVE A FAILED ACTOR AND FAILED COMEDIAN ARE SCIENTISTS.' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Attacks credibility of mainstream science popularizers by dismissing their scientific credentials and reducing them to entertainment backgrounds. References Bill Nye's background as comedian/TV personality and Neil deGrasse Tyson's media presence. Uses 'sheeple' (sheep + people) insult suggesting those who trust these figures are blindly following authority without critical thinking. Implies mainstream science education is entertainment propaganda rather than legitimate scientific discourse4:T41b,Satirical composite image showing 'Earthrise' from moon with Disney theme. Bottom half shows gray lunar surface with craters and rough terrain in black and white, mimicking famous Apollo moon photographs. Upper half shows black space. Rising above lunar horizon is light blue children's inflatable globe ball decorated with Disney characters - Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy positioned around globe with playful poses. Globe shows simplified world map with 'WALT DISNEY WORLD' text visible. Bottom right shows NASA logo altered with red slash and 'LIARS' text. Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical image mocking NASA's Apollo Earthrise photographs by replacing majestic Earth with cheap Disney toy globe, suggesting NASA's space imagery is as authentic as children's cartoon globes. Implies moon landings were staged theatrical productions, comparing NASA to Disney entertainment company. Uses Mickey Mouse iconography to suggest space program is fantasy/fiction for children rather than legitimate science0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-132","title":"Other 132","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12322609_508175386048867_1537640828806982945_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-131","title":"Other 131","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321694_487124251487314_3168701071416758240_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-133","title":"Other 133","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12339665_442607069272366_5021460751468119153_o.jpg","description":"Water level argument over dramatic ocean/beach sunset scene. Shows dark stormy sky with layers of gray, blue, and purple clouds. Orange-golden sunlight breaks through clouds creating atmospheric lighting. Dark ocean water visible in lower portion with small waves. Horizon line appears flat where ocean meets cloudy sky. White text overlay in elegant font reads: 'Whenever experiments have been tried on the surface of standing water, this surface has always been found to be level. If the Earth were a globe, the surface of all standing water would be convex.' Bottom text in bold white capitals: 'THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROOF THAT EARTH IS NOT A GLOBE.' Argues that still water's observable flatness contradicts spherical Earth, since curved surface would require water to bulge/curve. Presents water's levelness as empirical evidence through direct observation and experimentation. Claims scientific method (experiments on standing water) proves flat Earth rather than theoretical globe model"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
