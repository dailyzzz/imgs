3:T5b0,B.o.B rapper Twitter screenshots defending flat Earth position. Shows composite image with B.o.B promotional photo and Twitter posts. Large background image shows B.o.B (Bobby Ray Simmons Jr.), American rapper, in professional portrait. Wears black fedora hat, white shirt, silver chain necklace, looking to side with thoughtful expression. Text overlays show 'B.o.B' in large white letters. Right side displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Foreground shows three Twitter screenshots from verified account @bobatl with blue checkmark. Top tweet dated '4:20 PM - 25 Jan 2016' reads: 'Once you go flat, you never go back'. Second tweet shows profile image and username 'B.o.B @bobatl' with text: 'I'm going up against the greatest liars in history ... you've been tremendously deceived'. Third tweet from same account reads: 'Don't believe what I say, research what I say'. In January 2016, B.o.B sparked controversy by promoting flat Earth theory on Twitter, engaging in public debate with Neil deGrasse Tyson. B.o.B cited various arguments including lack of visible curvature, questioning official NASA imagery, and lighthouse visibility distances. Tyson responded with scientific explanations, leading to rap battle diss track 'Flatline' where B.o.B attacked mainstream science. Incident brought flat Earth theory into mainstream pop culture discussion. B.o.B's 'research what I say' encourages independent investigation rather than accepting authority4:T5a5,Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle wheel on moon surface with visible tire tracks. Shows Apollo moon mission photograph of LRV (Lunar Roving Vehicle/moon buggy) on lunar surface. Visible portion shows vehicle's wire-mesh wheel in center-right - distinctive tire made of woven metal wire creating chevron/zigzag tread pattern for traction in lunar regolith. Wheel appears silver-gray metallic. Attached to wheel is white/light gray landing leg or strut structure, mechanical components, and what appears to be astronaut's boot in white spacesuit material upper right. Lunar surface shows fine gray dust/regolith with visible tire tracks impressed into surface - two white arrows point to clear tread marks showing chevron pattern pressed into moon dust, one track in foreground left, another in background right. Surface appears uniformly gray with small rocks and pebbles scattered throughout. Top displays large white bold text: 'GOT TRACKS?' in impact font with black outline. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark. Photograph intended to show evidence of moon landings through tire tracks. Moon hoax skeptics question why tracks are so crisp and well-defined in vacuum with no atmospheric moisture to hold shape. Also question why dust doesn't stick to astronaut boots or why rover doesn't throw up dust plumes like it should in low gravity one-sixth Earth's. Argue photographs show inconsistencies with expected lunar environment behavior5:T5bf,Child with globe on head educational indoctrination image. Shows young boy standing in classroom in front of green chalkboard. Boy appears age 7-9, has short brown hair, wears light blue collared button-up shirt. Most striking element: standard desktop globe positioned directly on top of his head like hat - globe shows blue oceans, tan-brown-green continents, sits on traditional bronze/gold stand base. Boy's expression appears serious, slightly confused, looking toward camera with wide eyes and neutral mouth. Hands raised at sides in uncertain gesture. Background shows teal-green chalkboard with white frame, worn and marked from use. Side walls visible in gray-blue color. Top of image displays large white bold text: 'INDOCTRINATION'. Center shows translucent 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text in white letters reads: 'Because when something is true and correct, it must be hammered into the brains of defenseless children'. Image criticizes public education system for teaching globe Earth model to children before they develop critical thinking skills. Globe physically placed on child's head symbolizes forced imposition of worldview. Argues if Earth really were sphere, children would naturally discover this through observation rather than requiring repeated instruction. Claims educational system indoctrinates rather than educates. Suggests starting education with globe Earth as given fact prevents independent inquiry into Earth's actual shape0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-228","title":"Other 228","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661895_459877520878654_5572573329277913670_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-227","title":"Other 227","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661856_461369637396109_4173555124706847413_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-229","title":"Other 229","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661939_460924460773960_4001955883715102484_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
