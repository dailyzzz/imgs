5:T292f,Four-panel comparison questioning what medium space shuttle pushes against in vacuum. Visual argument comparing propulsion methods of vehicles operating in different mediums (air, water, vacuum) with text suggesting space travel is impossible without medium to push against. Format presents logical progression building to rhetorical question about spacecraft propulsion. Image divided into four horizontal panels stacked vertically, each showing vehicle in its operating environment with explanatory text. Panel backgrounds show photographic images of each vehicle/environment creating realistic presentation. Top panel: Commercial airliner in flight above clouds. Background shows jet aircraft (appears to be wide-body twin-engine passenger plane, possibly Boeing 787 or Airbus A350) in white livery banking or turning left. Aircraft photographed from slightly behind and below showing underside, wings, engines. Airplane positioned against sky background with thick white cloud layer visible below aircraft. Clear blue sky above clouds. Aircraft appears at cruising altitude (30,000-40,000 feet) above weather. Wing shows distinctive swept-back design with engines mounted in pods beneath. Text overlay in upper right in black sans-serif font on white semi-transparent background: "Airplane thrust pushes off air." Statement describes how jet engines work - engines intake air, compress it, mix with fuel, combust, and expel exhaust out back creating thrust via Newton's third law (for every action, equal and opposite reaction). Airplane pushes air backward, air pushes airplane forward. Second panel: Military submarine surfaced, moving through ocean. Background shows submarine at surface creating wake - appears to be nuclear-powered attack submarine (possibly US Los Angeles-class or similar) in dark gray/black color. Submarine's sail (conning tower) visible with crew members standing on top, suggesting submarine at periscope depth or fully surfaced. Submarine's hull creates white foam wake visible behind, indicating forward motion through water. Ocean water appears bright turquoise blue suggesting tropical or subtropical location. Sky shows light blue color with some clouds. White wake creates dramatic V-shape behind submarine emphasizing vessel pushing through water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "Submarines push off water." Statement describes submarine propulsion - propeller (or pump-jet) pushes water backward, creating forward thrust. Water serves as medium submarine pushes against. Third panel: Speedboat on lake or calm ocean creating spray. Background shows recreational powerboat in motion - appears to be performance boat with sleek design, painted in red and white with chrome/metallic accents. Boat number "226" visible on hull. Boat skimming across water surface at high speed creating dramatic white spray and wake. Boat's bow raised above water (planing configuration) typical of high-speed powerboats. Multiple outboard engines visible at stern. Background shows calm water surface in blue-green tones with slight ripples, suggesting lake or protected bay. Sky appears clear with light clouds. Boat creating impressive white rooster tail wake behind, demonstrating thrust pushing water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on right side: "Boats push off water too." Statement emphasizes same principle as submarines - propeller pushes water backward, water pushes boat forward. "Too" creates pattern suggesting all vehicles require medium to push against. Fourth/Bottom panel: Space Shuttle orbiter in space with Earth visible below. Background shows NASA Space Shuttle (appears to be Discovery, Atlantis, or Endeavour based on configuration) photographed from another spacecraft (likely ISS or separate shuttle). Shuttle appears in classic white thermal protection tile configuration with black nose and wing leading edges. Vertical stabilizer shows "United States" text and American flag. Shuttle payload bay appears open showing black interior. Shuttle positioned against spectacular backdrop of Earth from orbit - blue oceans visible with white cloud formations creating swirling patterns below. Earth's curved horizon visible showing atmospheric glow - thin blue line separating Earth from black space. Space appears absolutely black above Earth's atmosphere. Shuttle at orbital altitude (likely 200-300 miles) in microgravity environment. Shuttle shows no exhaust plumes (engines not firing during orbital coast). Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "WTF does the space shuttle push off?" Rhetorical question using vulgar intensifier ("what the f*ck") suggesting confusion, frustration, or challenge. Questions how shuttle creates thrust in space vacuum where no air or water exists to push against. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Argument's premise: Three vehicles (airplane, submarine, boat) operate by pushing against medium (air, water, water). Space shuttle operates in vacuum with no medium, therefore appears to defy physics. How does shuttle maneuver if nothing to push against? Suggests space travel is impossible or faked. However, argument reveals fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law and rocket propulsion: 1) ROCKET PROPULSION BASICS: Rockets don't push against external medium - they carry their own propellant. Rocket engine expels mass (exhaust) in one direction, creating equal and opposite reaction force propelling rocket in opposite direction. Rocket pushes exhaust backward, exhaust pushes rocket forward. No external medium needed. 2) NEWTON'S THIRD LAW: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Applies universally regardless of surrounding medium. Airplane engines work better in atmosphere because they intake air as propellant, but rockets carry both fuel AND oxidizer, making them independent of environment. 3) SPACE SHUTTLE SPECIFIC: Orbiter uses multiple propulsion systems: Main engines (three RS-25 engines) burn during ascent providing thrust by expelling exhaust, not by pushing against air (engines work identically in vacuum, actually more efficiently without atmospheric pressure). Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods contain engines burning hypergolic propellants for orbital adjustments, burns, deorbit. Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters positioned around orbiter provide attitude control (roll, pitch, yaw) by firing small bursts expelling gas. All systems work via mass expulsion, no external medium required. 4) VACUUM ADVANTAGE: Rocket engines actually work MORE efficiently in vacuum than atmosphere. In atmosphere, exhaust plume must push against external air pressure reducing efficiency. In vacuum, exhaust expands freely with no back-pressure, maximizing thrust. This is why rocket engines have different nozzle designs for sea level versus vacuum - vacuum engines have larger expansion nozzles for maximum efficiency. 5) CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM: Physics principle states total momentum conserved in closed system. Before firing, rocket + propellant have momentum zero (or steady velocity in orbital reference frame). After firing, exhaust has momentum in one direction, rocket has equal and opposite momentum in other direction. Total momentum remains constant. No external medium needed for momentum conservation. Comparison with airplanes/boats is misleading: Those vehicles use surrounding medium as reaction mass for convenience/efficiency (air/water abundant, no need to carry it). But they're still using Newtonian physics - engines create pressure differential pushing fluid backward, fluid pushes vehicle forward. Rockets simply bring their own reaction mass (propellant) instead of using environmental medium. Meme's "WTF" framing creates false puzzle: Sets up pattern (three vehicles push against medium) then presents space shuttle as exception that breaks pattern. But pattern itself is misconception - all four vehicles operate on same physics principle (Newton's third law via mass expulsion). Space shuttle is only vehicle shown working correctly by carrying its own reaction mass rather than depending on environmental medium. Historical evidence confirms rocket propulsion in vacuum: Robert Goddard tested first liquid-fueled rocket 1926, conducted vacuum chamber experiments proving rockets work without atmosphere. V-2 rockets reached 100+ km altitude in 1940s, beyond atmosphere. Sputnik 1 (1957), first artificial satellite, required rocket propulsion in vacuum to reach orbit. Thousands of satellites maintain orbits using onboard thrusters, observable from ground. Apollo missions used Service Module engine burns in lunar orbit (perfect vacuum) for trajectory corrections. Evidence observable to anyone: Satellites visible crossing night sky wouldn't remain in orbit without periodic thrust adjustments using onboard propulsion. International Space Station performs periodic reboost burns using Progress spacecraft thrusters or onboard thrusters to maintain orbital altitude, counteracting atmospheric drag. These burns occur in near-vacuum and are scheduled/announced in advance, observable by amateur astronomers tracking ISS. Image's effectiveness comes from exploiting intuitive misunderstanding: In daily life, we experience propulsion through mediums (walking pushes against ground, swimming pushes against water, cars push against road via tires). Vacuum propulsion is counterintuitive because it's outside common experience. But counterintuitive doesn't mean impossible - many physics principles are counterintuitive (quantum mechanics, relativity, even gravity). Education corrects intuition with evidence and mathematical models. "WTF" phrasing appeals to common sense but reflects lack of physics education rather than actual problem with space travel. Proper response to "WTF does space shuttle push off?" is: "It pushes its own exhaust backward. No external medium needed. Newton's third law works universally." Irony: Meme uses photo of actual space shuttle in actual orbit (photographed from ISS or other spacecraft) as evidence space travel doesn't work. Photo itself is proof shuttle reached orbit using the very propulsion physics meme questions. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) reveals worldview: rejecting rocket propulsion in vacuum is prerequisite for rejecting space travel generally, which is prerequisite for rejecting satellite imagery of spherical Earth, which supports flat Earth belief. Chain of reasoning requires denying well-established physics.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 368 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Four-panel comparison questioning what medium space shuttle pushes against in vacuum.
