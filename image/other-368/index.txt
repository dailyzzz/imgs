13:T292f,Four-panel comparison questioning what medium space shuttle pushes against in vacuum. Visual argument comparing propulsion methods of vehicles operating in different mediums (air, water, vacuum) with text suggesting space travel is impossible without medium to push against. Format presents logical progression building to rhetorical question about spacecraft propulsion. Image divided into four horizontal panels stacked vertically, each showing vehicle in its operating environment with explanatory text. Panel backgrounds show photographic images of each vehicle/environment creating realistic presentation. Top panel: Commercial airliner in flight above clouds. Background shows jet aircraft (appears to be wide-body twin-engine passenger plane, possibly Boeing 787 or Airbus A350) in white livery banking or turning left. Aircraft photographed from slightly behind and below showing underside, wings, engines. Airplane positioned against sky background with thick white cloud layer visible below aircraft. Clear blue sky above clouds. Aircraft appears at cruising altitude (30,000-40,000 feet) above weather. Wing shows distinctive swept-back design with engines mounted in pods beneath. Text overlay in upper right in black sans-serif font on white semi-transparent background: "Airplane thrust pushes off air." Statement describes how jet engines work - engines intake air, compress it, mix with fuel, combust, and expel exhaust out back creating thrust via Newton's third law (for every action, equal and opposite reaction). Airplane pushes air backward, air pushes airplane forward. Second panel: Military submarine surfaced, moving through ocean. Background shows submarine at surface creating wake - appears to be nuclear-powered attack submarine (possibly US Los Angeles-class or similar) in dark gray/black color. Submarine's sail (conning tower) visible with crew members standing on top, suggesting submarine at periscope depth or fully surfaced. Submarine's hull creates white foam wake visible behind, indicating forward motion through water. Ocean water appears bright turquoise blue suggesting tropical or subtropical location. Sky shows light blue color with some clouds. White wake creates dramatic V-shape behind submarine emphasizing vessel pushing through water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "Submarines push off water." Statement describes submarine propulsion - propeller (or pump-jet) pushes water backward, creating forward thrust. Water serves as medium submarine pushes against. Third panel: Speedboat on lake or calm ocean creating spray. Background shows recreational powerboat in motion - appears to be performance boat with sleek design, painted in red and white with chrome/metallic accents. Boat number "226" visible on hull. Boat skimming across water surface at high speed creating dramatic white spray and wake. Boat's bow raised above water (planing configuration) typical of high-speed powerboats. Multiple outboard engines visible at stern. Background shows calm water surface in blue-green tones with slight ripples, suggesting lake or protected bay. Sky appears clear with light clouds. Boat creating impressive white rooster tail wake behind, demonstrating thrust pushing water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on right side: "Boats push off water too." Statement emphasizes same principle as submarines - propeller pushes water backward, water pushes boat forward. "Too" creates pattern suggesting all vehicles require medium to push against. Fourth/Bottom panel: Space Shuttle orbiter in space with Earth visible below. Background shows NASA Space Shuttle (appears to be Discovery, Atlantis, or Endeavour based on configuration) photographed from another spacecraft (likely ISS or separate shuttle). Shuttle appears in classic white thermal protection tile configuration with black nose and wing leading edges. Vertical stabilizer shows "United States" text and American flag. Shuttle payload bay appears open showing black interior. Shuttle positioned against spectacular backdrop of Earth from orbit - blue oceans visible with white cloud formations creating swirling patterns below. Earth's curved horizon visible showing atmospheric glow - thin blue line separating Earth from black space. Space appears absolutely black above Earth's atmosphere. Shuttle at orbital altitude (likely 200-300 miles) in microgravity environment. Shuttle shows no exhaust plumes (engines not firing during orbital coast). Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "WTF does the space shuttle push off?" Rhetorical question using vulgar intensifier ("what the f*ck") suggesting confusion, frustration, or challenge. Questions how shuttle creates thrust in space vacuum where no air or water exists to push against. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Argument's premise: Three vehicles (airplane, submarine, boat) operate by pushing against medium (air, water, water). Space shuttle operates in vacuum with no medium, therefore appears to defy physics. How does shuttle maneuver if nothing to push against? Suggests space travel is impossible or faked. However, argument reveals fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law and rocket propulsion: 1) ROCKET PROPULSION BASICS: Rockets don't push against external medium - they carry their own propellant. Rocket engine expels mass (exhaust) in one direction, creating equal and opposite reaction force propelling rocket in opposite direction. Rocket pushes exhaust backward, exhaust pushes rocket forward. No external medium needed. 2) NEWTON'S THIRD LAW: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Applies universally regardless of surrounding medium. Airplane engines work better in atmosphere because they intake air as propellant, but rockets carry both fuel AND oxidizer, making them independent of environment. 3) SPACE SHUTTLE SPECIFIC: Orbiter uses multiple propulsion systems: Main engines (three RS-25 engines) burn during ascent providing thrust by expelling exhaust, not by pushing against air (engines work identically in vacuum, actually more efficiently without atmospheric pressure). Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods contain engines burning hypergolic propellants for orbital adjustments, burns, deorbit. Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters positioned around orbiter provide attitude control (roll, pitch, yaw) by firing small bursts expelling gas. All systems work via mass expulsion, no external medium required. 4) VACUUM ADVANTAGE: Rocket engines actually work MORE efficiently in vacuum than atmosphere. In atmosphere, exhaust plume must push against external air pressure reducing efficiency. In vacuum, exhaust expands freely with no back-pressure, maximizing thrust. This is why rocket engines have different nozzle designs for sea level versus vacuum - vacuum engines have larger expansion nozzles for maximum efficiency. 5) CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM: Physics principle states total momentum conserved in closed system. Before firing, rocket + propellant have momentum zero (or steady velocity in orbital reference frame). After firing, exhaust has momentum in one direction, rocket has equal and opposite momentum in other direction. Total momentum remains constant. No external medium needed for momentum conservation. Comparison with airplanes/boats is misleading: Those vehicles use surrounding medium as reaction mass for convenience/efficiency (air/water abundant, no need to carry it). But they're still using Newtonian physics - engines create pressure differential pushing fluid backward, fluid pushes vehicle forward. Rockets simply bring their own reaction mass (propellant) instead of using environmental medium. Meme's "WTF" framing creates false puzzle: Sets up pattern (three vehicles push against medium) then presents space shuttle as exception that breaks pattern. But pattern itself is misconception - all four vehicles operate on same physics principle (Newton's third law via mass expulsion). Space shuttle is only vehicle shown working correctly by carrying its own reaction mass rather than depending on environmental medium. Historical evidence confirms rocket propulsion in vacuum: Robert Goddard tested first liquid-fueled rocket 1926, conducted vacuum chamber experiments proving rockets work without atmosphere. V-2 rockets reached 100+ km altitude in 1940s, beyond atmosphere. Sputnik 1 (1957), first artificial satellite, required rocket propulsion in vacuum to reach orbit. Thousands of satellites maintain orbits using onboard thrusters, observable from ground. Apollo missions used Service Module engine burns in lunar orbit (perfect vacuum) for trajectory corrections. Evidence observable to anyone: Satellites visible crossing night sky wouldn't remain in orbit without periodic thrust adjustments using onboard propulsion. International Space Station performs periodic reboost burns using Progress spacecraft thrusters or onboard thrusters to maintain orbital altitude, counteracting atmospheric drag. These burns occur in near-vacuum and are scheduled/announced in advance, observable by amateur astronomers tracking ISS. Image's effectiveness comes from exploiting intuitive misunderstanding: In daily life, we experience propulsion through mediums (walking pushes against ground, swimming pushes against water, cars push against road via tires). Vacuum propulsion is counterintuitive because it's outside common experience. But counterintuitive doesn't mean impossible - many physics principles are counterintuitive (quantum mechanics, relativity, even gravity). Education corrects intuition with evidence and mathematical models. "WTF" phrasing appeals to common sense but reflects lack of physics education rather than actual problem with space travel. Proper response to "WTF does space shuttle push off?" is: "It pushes its own exhaust backward. No external medium needed. Newton's third law works universally." Irony: Meme uses photo of actual space shuttle in actual orbit (photographed from ISS or other spacecraft) as evidence space travel doesn't work. Photo itself is proof shuttle reached orbit using the very propulsion physics meme questions. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) reveals worldview: rejecting rocket propulsion in vacuum is prerequisite for rejecting space travel generally, which is prerequisite for rejecting satellite imagery of spherical Earth, which supports flat Earth belief. Chain of reasoning requires denying well-established physics.14:T21a8,Cognitive dissonance quote over ocean sunset image explaining resistance to evidence contradicting core beliefs. Inspirational image format combining dramatic nature photography with psychology quote commonly used in flat Earth communities to explain why people reject flat Earth evidence. Background shows spectacular ocean sunset or sunrise photograph. Lower portion displays calm ocean water surface appearing dark blue-gray with slight texture suggesting gentle waves or ripples. Water extends to horizon creating strong horizontal line dividing sea from sky. Horizon line perfectly straight cutting across center of image. Water surface reflects golden-yellow light from sun creating shimmering vertical column of reflected sunlight extending from horizon toward bottom of frame. Reflection appears as bright golden-yellow streak on water contrasting dramatically with darker surrounding ocean tones. Upper portion shows dramatic cloudy sky during golden hour. Heavy cloud cover dominates sky - thick gray-blue clouds creating layered formations across frame. Clouds show three-dimensional structure with darker undersides and brighter edges where sunlight breaks through. Gap in clouds at horizon allows sunlight to burst through creating spectacular light rays (crepuscular rays) radiating outward and upward from horizon point. Sun itself hidden behind clouds but light streams through opening creating golden-yellow glow illuminating cloud edges. Sun's rays appear as distinct beams spreading across sky - classic god rays or Jacob's ladder effect where atmospheric particles and cloud shadows create visible light beams. Sky shows gradient from bright golden-yellow near horizon where sun breaks through, to deeper blue-gray above where thick clouds block light. Overall lighting creates moody atmospheric scene with dramatic interplay of light and shadow. Ocean scene conveys sense of vast natural beauty, contemplative mood, transition between day and night suggesting metaphorical threshold or transformation. Text overlays in white sans-serif font span image width. Top shows title "Cognitive dissonance" in large letters serving as heading. Below title, lengthy quote fills center portion in smaller white text creating paragraph: "Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief." Quote defines cognitive dissonance - psychological discomfort experienced when confronted with information contradicting firmly held beliefs. Lower right shows attribution "— Frantz Fanon" crediting quote to psychiatrist and political philosopher (1925-1961), though quote attribution questionable - doesn't match Fanon's known writings style/topics. Lower left displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Lower center-right shows semi-transparent watermark text "Flat Earth Matters" in gray barely visible against ocean background. Image appears in flat Earth communities to preempt criticism and explain why people reject flat Earth claims. Argument operates as defensive inoculation against contrary evidence: 1) PREEMPTIVE DISMISSAL: By posting this, flat Earthers frame any disagreement as psychological denial rather than legitimate evaluation of evidence. If someone presents evidence for spherical Earth (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, satellite imagery), flat Earther can respond: "You're experiencing cognitive dissonance - you can't accept evidence contradicting your core globe Earth belief." Reverses burden of proof. 2) PROJECTION: Quote accurately describes cognitive dissonance but flat Earthers apply it to wrong group. Globe Earth believers shown evidence (photos from space, physics experiments, navigation data) that confirms rather than contradicts their belief. Flat Earthers are ones holding core belief (Earth is flat) and rationalizing/ignoring/denying contrary evidence (ships disappearing hull-first, time zones, seasons, different stars at different latitudes, GPS satellites, circumnavigation, physics of gravity). 3) PSYCHOLOGICAL INSIGHT AS WEAPON: Understanding cognitive dissonance is valuable psychological concept explaining why people resist changing beliefs despite evidence (applies to many contexts - political beliefs, religious views, personal relationships). But knowing about cognitive dissonance doesn't make one immune to it. Flat Earth movement exhibits classic cognitive dissonance - when shown evidence Earth is spherical, they rationalize it away as CGI, conspiracy, optical illusion, or government lies. Each piece of contrary evidence strengthens commitment to flat Earth belief through backfire effect. 4) IRONY: If flat Earthers truly understood cognitive dissonance and wanted to avoid it, they would examine their own resistance to overwhelming evidence for spherical Earth. Instead, they use concept as shield against criticism. This itself demonstrates cognitive dissonance - holding belief (we're immune to cognitive bias because we recognize it in others) that contradicts evidence (their behavior shows classic bias patterns). Quote attribution to Frantz Fanon is likely misattribution or paraphrase - Fanon wrote about colonialism, racism, revolutionary psychology, not specifically about cognitive dissonance in these terms. Cognitive dissonance theory developed by Leon Festinger (1957), social psychologist who studied UFO cult that predicted world ending on specific date. When prediction failed, believers didn't abandon belief but rationalized failure, showing cognitive dissonance in action. Festinger's work showed people preserve core beliefs by: denying contradictory evidence exists, reinterpreting evidence to fit belief, adding new beliefs to resolve contradiction, downgrading importance of contradiction. Flat Earth movement exhibits all these patterns. Ocean sunset background chosen for emotional appeal - beautiful nature photography creates positive feeling, making viewer more receptive to message. Dramatic lighting suggests revelation, breakthrough, seeing truth others miss. Golden rays breaking through clouds evoke enlightenment metaphor - light representing truth breaking through darkness of ignorance. Manipulative pairing of attractive imagery with dubious argument. Usage in flat Earth context reveals fundamental misunderstanding: Cognitive dissonance isn't about refusing to accept "truth" - it's about discomfort from holding contradictory beliefs simultaneously. People can experience cognitive dissonance and still be right (refusing to accept false claims that contradict accurate beliefs). Cognitive dissonance doesn't indicate who's correct, just who's experiencing psychological discomfort. Scientific method specifically designed to overcome cognitive biases including dissonance: require reproducible results, peer review, falsifiable hypotheses, data-driven conclusions regardless of researcher's preferences. Scientists actively try to prove themselves wrong, seek disconfirming evidence, update models when evidence warrants. Contrast with flat Earth approach: seek only confirming evidence, dismiss contrary evidence as conspiracy, never update model despite contradictions. Actual cognitive dissonance in flat Earth community: Must believe NASA has nearly unlimited resources for faking space (thousands of employees, decades of missions, hundreds of billions of dollars) while simultaneously being incompetent enough to leave obvious "mistakes" in footage flat Earthers claim to detect. Must believe all nations including hostile adversaries collaborate on space hoax while competing in every other domain. Must believe laws of physics work everywhere except where they prove spherical Earth. Maintaining these contradictory beliefs requires constant rationalization - textbook cognitive dissonance. Image represents psychological projection - accusing others of bias flat Earthers themselves demonstrate. By "educating" followers about cognitive dissonance, movement provides explanation for why family, friends, scientists reject flat Earth - not because it's wrong, but because they're psychologically unable to accept "truth." This framing protects flat Earth belief from falsification - any contrary evidence gets dismissed as cognitive dissonance in denier, never examined as potential falsification of flat Earth model.15:T2534,Obama official portrait parody contrasting science and belief with "I say round, you say flat / I have math, you have facts" wordplay. Humorous meme format using formal presidential portrait style to mock flat Earth movement's dismissal of mathematical evidence for spherical Earth. Image mimics official White House presidential portrait aesthetic - neutral gray gradient background suggesting professional photography studio setup typical of formal government portraits. Text overlays in large bold letters span width creating call-and-response structure. Top text reads "I SAY ROUND" in black uppercase letters. Just below, second line reads "YOU SAY FLAT" in matching style. Gap in center where portrait would be positioned. Bottom text continues: "I HAVE MATH" in black uppercase. Final line completes: "YOU HAVE FACTS" creating ironic contrast. Text positioned to leave central area clear for face, following traditional portrait composition. "Facts" is italicized for emphasis. Center contains manipulated photograph designed to look like official presidential portrait. Image shows Barack Obama's face from official White House portrait, but body replaced with muscular torso. Obama's head appears normal - recognizable presidential portrait showing professional lighting, neutral expression, dark suit with American flag pin typically worn in official photos. However, from neck down, image shows impossibly muscular bodybuilder physique wearing formal attire - dark suit jacket, white dress shirt, red necktie creating absurd juxtaposition between presidential face and exaggerated muscularity. Photoshop composite creates humorous visual metaphor: intellectual authority (Obama as president, representing education, science) combined with physical dominance (muscular body representing strength). Composite suggests "my argument so strong, I'm intellectually AND physically superior." Visual absurdity is intentional humor - nobody expects viewer to believe Obama actually has bodybuilder physique. Meme operates through wordplay and format subversion: 1) "I SAY ROUND, YOU SAY FLAT" - References classic call-and-response pattern ("you say goodbye, I say hello" from Beatles, or children's games where leader says one thing, group responds with opposite). Establishes dichotomy between speaker (defending spherical Earth) and addressee (flat Earther). "Round" versus "flat" is the central disagreement. 2) "I HAVE MATH, YOU HAVE FACTS" - Ironic twist where "math" positioned as superior to "facts." Surface reading suggests both sides have evidence (math versus facts), but meme's irony reveals that flat Earthers claim to have "facts" while rejecting mathematical proofs Earth is spherical. Real message: flat Earthers call opinions/beliefs "facts" while dismissing actual mathematical evidence as invalid. Suggests flat Earth movement operates on feelings and assertions ("facts" in scare quotes) rather than quantifiable proof (math). 3) AUTHORITY POSITIONING: Using Obama portrait invokes presidential authority, scientific literacy, education. Obama known for respecting science, evidence-based policy. His image represents educated establishment that accepts spherical Earth based on math and science. Contrast with flat Earth movement's anti-establishment, anti-intellectual positioning. Obama becomes avatar for "globe Earth believers" generally. 4) MUSCULAR BODY ADDITION: Photoshopped muscles add layer of humor making meme shareable beyond just clever wordplay. Also suggests dominance - "my argument defeats yours" expressed through physical superiority metaphor. Absurdist humor prevents meme from being purely preachy. 5) FORMAT SUBVERSION: Formal portrait style with serious governmental aesthetic combined with ridiculous body modification and mocking text creates contrast between serious appearance and humorous message. Mathematical evidence for spherical Earth is extensive: Trigonometry and geometry prove sphere through measurements of angles, distances, curvature. Ancient Greeks calculated Earth's circumference using shadows and geometry (Eratosthenes, 240 BCE). Navigation requires spherical trigonometry - ships/planes use great circle routes (shortest paths on sphere) that would make no sense on flat plane. Pilots and ship captains continuously verify spherical math through successful navigation. Trigonometric calculations predict exactly where celestial objects appear based on observer latitude/longitude on sphere - predictions confirmed by every observation. Flat Earth models cannot produce working mathematical predictions for sun/star positions, moon phases, eclipse timing, seasonal variations. Physics equations involving gravity, orbital mechanics, planetary motion all require spherical Earth - alter shape to flat and math breaks, predictions fail. Engineering disciplines (satellite communications, GPS, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine navigation) all depend on spherical Earth math - systems work perfectly confirming mathematical model. "YOU HAVE FACTS" ironically references flat Earth movement's claim they're the ones with "facts" and "evidence" while globe believers accept lies. But flat Earth "facts" are typically: misinterpreted photos, claims of seeing too far (ignoring atmospheric refraction), quote-mining, conspiracy theories about NASA, appeals to "common sense" over measurement. These aren't facts in scientific sense (independently verifiable observations), but assertions, beliefs, misunderstandings treated as facts. Real facts support spherical Earth: ships disappear hull-first over horizon (consistent with curved surface), different stars visible from different latitudes (impossible on flat plane), time zones exist because different locations experience sunlight at different times as sphere rotates, seasons occur due to axial tilt of sphere causing varying sunlight angles throughout year, photos from space show spherical Earth, gravity pulls toward center creating spherical shape for large bodies. Meme's humor effective because it captures frustration of trying to debate someone who rejects mathematical proofs: If someone dismisses geometry, trigonometry, physics calculations as invalid or faked, discussion becomes impossible. Math provides objective, verifiable framework - anyone can check calculations. "Facts" without math can be subjective, cherry-picked, misinterpreted. Saying "you have facts" sarcastically means "you have claims you call facts, but they're not supported by mathematics that would make them verifiable facts." Obama choice particularly apt because: His presidency emphasized science, appointed scientists to key positions, fought climate change denial with scientific evidence. His education (Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law) represents academic achievement and critical thinking skills flat Earth movement often dismisses as "indoctrination." He symbolizes political left/establishment that accepts scientific consensus, versus populist anti-establishment movements that reject expert opinion. Using his image positions flat Earth debate within broader culture wars between expertise/credentials versus common sense/outsider status. Muscular Photoshop addition could reference political cartoon traditions where leaders depicted with exaggerated features for symbolic meaning. Here muscles mean strength of argument, intellectual dominance. Or simply added for viral spread - absurdist humor increases sharing. Meme functions as in-group signaling for spherical Earth believers - sharing it says "I'm on the side with math, not just opinions." Also serves as dismissive response to flat Earth arguments - instead of lengthy scientific explanation, send this image summarizing position: "My side has rigorous mathematics, your side has feelings masquerading as facts." Effectiveness stems from economy - captures complex epistemological debate (how do we know what's true? Through measurement and math, or through intuition and assertions?) in simple four-line format. Weakness is preaching to choir - flat Earthers seeing this would likely dismiss it as smug, condescending, or would claim they DO have math (citing their misunderstood experiments or flawed calculations). Unlikely to change minds, but provides emotional satisfaction and humor to those frustrated by flat Earth movement's rejection of mathematical evidence. Visual composition draws eye to absurd muscular body first, then text, creating memorable impact. Formal portrait style makes manipulation more surprising, enhancing humor. Meme could be read as elitist or dismissive - suggesting flat Earthers too stupid to understand math. But can also be read as defending scientific literacy and mathematical reasoning as necessary tools for determining truth about physical reality. In debate where one side claims Earth is flat despite overwhelming mathematical evidence otherwise, some dismissiveness perhaps warranted. Ultimate message: Mathematical proofs are not opinions - they're verifiable, checkable calculations that anyone can perform and confirm. Flat Earth movement's resistance to mathematics reveals belief-based rather than evidence-based reasoning. Calling beliefs "facts" doesn't make them true if they can't be mathematically modeled or don't match measurements. Source shows typical meme font, layout conventions suggesting creation via online meme generator. Format easily replicable for other topics following "I say X, you say Y, I have A, you have B" structure with humorous authority figure portrait.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-368","title":"Other 368","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12841435_473299212869818_1728320907122071022_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-367","title":"Other 367","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12841323_473705942829145_7349913365457253245_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-369","title":"Other 369","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12885874_482934821906257_7991367714673482844_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

16:T292f,Four-panel comparison questioning what medium space shuttle pushes against in vacuum. Visual argument comparing propulsion methods of vehicles operating in different mediums (air, water, vacuum) with text suggesting space travel is impossible without medium to push against. Format presents logical progression building to rhetorical question about spacecraft propulsion. Image divided into four horizontal panels stacked vertically, each showing vehicle in its operating environment with explanatory text. Panel backgrounds show photographic images of each vehicle/environment creating realistic presentation. Top panel: Commercial airliner in flight above clouds. Background shows jet aircraft (appears to be wide-body twin-engine passenger plane, possibly Boeing 787 or Airbus A350) in white livery banking or turning left. Aircraft photographed from slightly behind and below showing underside, wings, engines. Airplane positioned against sky background with thick white cloud layer visible below aircraft. Clear blue sky above clouds. Aircraft appears at cruising altitude (30,000-40,000 feet) above weather. Wing shows distinctive swept-back design with engines mounted in pods beneath. Text overlay in upper right in black sans-serif font on white semi-transparent background: "Airplane thrust pushes off air." Statement describes how jet engines work - engines intake air, compress it, mix with fuel, combust, and expel exhaust out back creating thrust via Newton's third law (for every action, equal and opposite reaction). Airplane pushes air backward, air pushes airplane forward. Second panel: Military submarine surfaced, moving through ocean. Background shows submarine at surface creating wake - appears to be nuclear-powered attack submarine (possibly US Los Angeles-class or similar) in dark gray/black color. Submarine's sail (conning tower) visible with crew members standing on top, suggesting submarine at periscope depth or fully surfaced. Submarine's hull creates white foam wake visible behind, indicating forward motion through water. Ocean water appears bright turquoise blue suggesting tropical or subtropical location. Sky shows light blue color with some clouds. White wake creates dramatic V-shape behind submarine emphasizing vessel pushing through water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "Submarines push off water." Statement describes submarine propulsion - propeller (or pump-jet) pushes water backward, creating forward thrust. Water serves as medium submarine pushes against. Third panel: Speedboat on lake or calm ocean creating spray. Background shows recreational powerboat in motion - appears to be performance boat with sleek design, painted in red and white with chrome/metallic accents. Boat number "226" visible on hull. Boat skimming across water surface at high speed creating dramatic white spray and wake. Boat's bow raised above water (planing configuration) typical of high-speed powerboats. Multiple outboard engines visible at stern. Background shows calm water surface in blue-green tones with slight ripples, suggesting lake or protected bay. Sky appears clear with light clouds. Boat creating impressive white rooster tail wake behind, demonstrating thrust pushing water. Text overlay in white font with black outline on right side: "Boats push off water too." Statement emphasizes same principle as submarines - propeller pushes water backward, water pushes boat forward. "Too" creates pattern suggesting all vehicles require medium to push against. Fourth/Bottom panel: Space Shuttle orbiter in space with Earth visible below. Background shows NASA Space Shuttle (appears to be Discovery, Atlantis, or Endeavour based on configuration) photographed from another spacecraft (likely ISS or separate shuttle). Shuttle appears in classic white thermal protection tile configuration with black nose and wing leading edges. Vertical stabilizer shows "United States" text and American flag. Shuttle payload bay appears open showing black interior. Shuttle positioned against spectacular backdrop of Earth from orbit - blue oceans visible with white cloud formations creating swirling patterns below. Earth's curved horizon visible showing atmospheric glow - thin blue line separating Earth from black space. Space appears absolutely black above Earth's atmosphere. Shuttle at orbital altitude (likely 200-300 miles) in microgravity environment. Shuttle shows no exhaust plumes (engines not firing during orbital coast). Text overlay in white font with black outline on left side: "WTF does the space shuttle push off?" Rhetorical question using vulgar intensifier ("what the f*ck") suggesting confusion, frustration, or challenge. Questions how shuttle creates thrust in space vacuum where no air or water exists to push against. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Argument's premise: Three vehicles (airplane, submarine, boat) operate by pushing against medium (air, water, water). Space shuttle operates in vacuum with no medium, therefore appears to defy physics. How does shuttle maneuver if nothing to push against? Suggests space travel is impossible or faked. However, argument reveals fundamental misunderstanding of Newton's third law and rocket propulsion: 1) ROCKET PROPULSION BASICS: Rockets don't push against external medium - they carry their own propellant. Rocket engine expels mass (exhaust) in one direction, creating equal and opposite reaction force propelling rocket in opposite direction. Rocket pushes exhaust backward, exhaust pushes rocket forward. No external medium needed. 2) NEWTON'S THIRD LAW: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." Applies universally regardless of surrounding medium. Airplane engines work better in atmosphere because they intake air as propellant, but rockets carry both fuel AND oxidizer, making them independent of environment. 3) SPACE SHUTTLE SPECIFIC: Orbiter uses multiple propulsion systems: Main engines (three RS-25 engines) burn during ascent providing thrust by expelling exhaust, not by pushing against air (engines work identically in vacuum, actually more efficiently without atmospheric pressure). Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods contain engines burning hypergolic propellants for orbital adjustments, burns, deorbit. Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters positioned around orbiter provide attitude control (roll, pitch, yaw) by firing small bursts expelling gas. All systems work via mass expulsion, no external medium required. 4) VACUUM ADVANTAGE: Rocket engines actually work MORE efficiently in vacuum than atmosphere. In atmosphere, exhaust plume must push against external air pressure reducing efficiency. In vacuum, exhaust expands freely with no back-pressure, maximizing thrust. This is why rocket engines have different nozzle designs for sea level versus vacuum - vacuum engines have larger expansion nozzles for maximum efficiency. 5) CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM: Physics principle states total momentum conserved in closed system. Before firing, rocket + propellant have momentum zero (or steady velocity in orbital reference frame). After firing, exhaust has momentum in one direction, rocket has equal and opposite momentum in other direction. Total momentum remains constant. No external medium needed for momentum conservation. Comparison with airplanes/boats is misleading: Those vehicles use surrounding medium as reaction mass for convenience/efficiency (air/water abundant, no need to carry it). But they're still using Newtonian physics - engines create pressure differential pushing fluid backward, fluid pushes vehicle forward. Rockets simply bring their own reaction mass (propellant) instead of using environmental medium. Meme's "WTF" framing creates false puzzle: Sets up pattern (three vehicles push against medium) then presents space shuttle as exception that breaks pattern. But pattern itself is misconception - all four vehicles operate on same physics principle (Newton's third law via mass expulsion). Space shuttle is only vehicle shown working correctly by carrying its own reaction mass rather than depending on environmental medium. Historical evidence confirms rocket propulsion in vacuum: Robert Goddard tested first liquid-fueled rocket 1926, conducted vacuum chamber experiments proving rockets work without atmosphere. V-2 rockets reached 100+ km altitude in 1940s, beyond atmosphere. Sputnik 1 (1957), first artificial satellite, required rocket propulsion in vacuum to reach orbit. Thousands of satellites maintain orbits using onboard thrusters, observable from ground. Apollo missions used Service Module engine burns in lunar orbit (perfect vacuum) for trajectory corrections. Evidence observable to anyone: Satellites visible crossing night sky wouldn't remain in orbit without periodic thrust adjustments using onboard propulsion. International Space Station performs periodic reboost burns using Progress spacecraft thrusters or onboard thrusters to maintain orbital altitude, counteracting atmospheric drag. These burns occur in near-vacuum and are scheduled/announced in advance, observable by amateur astronomers tracking ISS. Image's effectiveness comes from exploiting intuitive misunderstanding: In daily life, we experience propulsion through mediums (walking pushes against ground, swimming pushes against water, cars push against road via tires). Vacuum propulsion is counterintuitive because it's outside common experience. But counterintuitive doesn't mean impossible - many physics principles are counterintuitive (quantum mechanics, relativity, even gravity). Education corrects intuition with evidence and mathematical models. "WTF" phrasing appeals to common sense but reflects lack of physics education rather than actual problem with space travel. Proper response to "WTF does space shuttle push off?" is: "It pushes its own exhaust backward. No external medium needed. Newton's third law works universally." Irony: Meme uses photo of actual space shuttle in actual orbit (photographed from ISS or other spacecraft) as evidence space travel doesn't work. Photo itself is proof shuttle reached orbit using the very propulsion physics meme questions. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) reveals worldview: rejecting rocket propulsion in vacuum is prerequisite for rejecting space travel generally, which is prerequisite for rejecting satellite imagery of spherical Earth, which supports flat Earth belief. Chain of reasoning requires denying well-established physics.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 368 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Four-panel comparison questioning what medium space shuttle pushes against in vacuum.
