3:T57c,Surreal awakening imagery with opening head revealing globe Earth. Shows digitally rendered 3D figure of dark silhouetted human head tilted back with top of cranium opening like hinged lid or door. Inside opened skull cavity sits photorealistic CGI globe Earth showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (North and South America visible), white cloud patterns, atmosphere glow. Earth appears to be emerging from or stored inside the head. Figure shows defined facial features - closed eyes, nose, lips in peaceful expression. Body visible below wearing dark clothing. Background shows gradient sky from light blue-white at top to darker blue-gray at bottom suggesting dawn or dusk. Top text in large white bold letters: 'THE WORLD IS WAKING UP, DON'T STAY ASLEEP'. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Image uses awakening/enlightenment metaphor suggesting people are discovering truth about Earth's shape. Implies mainstream worldview of globe Earth is mental programming or indoctrination stored in people's minds. Opening head symbolizes breaking free from conditioning, removing implanted beliefs, achieving consciousness. 'Don't stay asleep' references Matrix red pill concept and awakening to hidden reality. Suggests flat Earth awareness is spreading and viewers should join the enlightenment movement before being left behind in ignorance4:T647,Leonardo da Vinci quote about perception over sunset cliff landscape. Shows dramatic scenic photograph of person standing on rocky cliff edge at golden hour sunset. Person appears as dark silhouette wearing casual clothes (jacket, pants) standing with legs apart on prominent rock outcropping left side of frame. Large rocky cliff face or boulder visible on left edge. Foreground shows brown-gray rocky terrain with some sparse vegetation (grass, small bushes). Middle-ground stretches into hazy distant valley or plains area. Sky dominates upper two-thirds showing spectacular sunset - layers of clouds in purple-gray, pink, orange, and peachy tones. Bright yellow-orange sun disk visible on horizon right of center, slightly above horizon line. Warm golden-orange glow illuminates clouds from below. Top portion shows white text: 'There are three classes of people: Those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.' Attribution below: '— Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in light gray translucent text. Quote attributed to Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci suggests hierarchy of perception and understanding. Flat Earth proponents interpret themselves as 'those who see' - able to perceive truth without being shown. Mainstream believers are 'those who see when shown' - require authority to point out reality. Globe Earth believers are 'those who do not see' - refuse truth even when presented with evidence. Inspirational framing with person gazing at horizon suggests enlightenment, truth-seeking, and seeing beyond illusions5:T590,Satirical NASA parody collage with Neil deGrasse Tyson in cosmic setting. Shows complex composite image mocking space science establishment. Background displays vibrant nebula space scene with purple-pink-orange clouds, stars, galaxies. Upper left corner shows NASA logo parody - blue circular badge with red swoosh replaced by word 'LIARS' in red text. Center shows woman (likely science educator or Neil deGrasse Tyson in context) with dark curly hair, brown skin, wearing sparkly dark sleeveless vest/top, looking down at hands as if manipulating objects. Multiple celestial bodies float around her as if she's arranging props: photorealistic Earth globe showing Americas, gray Moon, tan Mars-like planet with cartoon ram/Aries symbol face and rainbow vomit, blue Neptune-like planet. Lower portion shows two astronauts in white NASA spacesuits with American flag patches and mission badges. Left astronaut holds sign reading 'It's all FAKE'. Right astronaut visible in typical EVA spacesuit. Bottom displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature. Image satirizes mainstream space science by suggesting space exploration is theatrical production with Neil deGrasse Tyson as stage manager arranging props. Astronaut's 'It's all FAKE' sign explicitly states moon landing hoax belief. Portrays cosmos as artificial set pieces that can be moved by hand rather than massive distant celestial bodies0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-209","title":"Other 209","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633665_461160384083701_2590785089438878047_o.png","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-208","title":"Other 208","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633498_458496047683468_3694862073385235037_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-210","title":"Other 210","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633729_458255607707512_7478934796738001520_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
