3:T476,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Coriolis Effect. Title at top reads 'The Coriolis Effect' in elegant gray font. Top panel shows military sniper in white winter camouflage and face covering looking through scope of large tactical rifle with suppressor, lying in prone shooting position. Snow or winter environment visible. White text overlay: 'SAYS THE EARTH SPINS UNDER A SNIPER'S BULLET'. Bottom panel shows vibrant collection of colorful hot air balloons floating in clear blue sky - including yellow/blue striped balloon on left, orange/black striped large balloon in center, blue balloon with stars, red balloon, balloons in various colors (yellow, green, blue, red, orange patterns). White text overlay: 'BUT IT DOESN'T SPIN UNDER THESE BALLOONS?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in cyan at bottom right. Meme argues if Coriolis Effect (Earth's rotation affecting moving objects) requires snipers to compensate for Earth's rotation when shooting long distances, then stationary hot air balloons should drift due to same rotation. Questions why balloons don't experience apparent motion if Earth rotates beneath them while suspended in air4:T4b4,NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph with annotations pointing out alleged copy-paste duplications. Shows classic spherical Earth image with deep blue oceans, white cloud formations, and green-brown landmass visible (appears to be Central/South America). Top text in white bold letters: 'NASA'S BLUE MARBLE EARTH IMAGE' and 'CTRL + C, CTRL + V' (keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste). Image marked with colored boxes and circles highlighting supposedly identical cloud patterns in different locations across photograph. Red rectangular boxes outline cloud formations on left side. White rectangular boxes mark patterns near bottom center. Purple circles with 'Ps' (Photoshop) indicators mark suspicious areas in upper portions. Cyan/turquoise rectangular boxes highlight patterns in middle and right sections. Yellow circles mark additional questionable areas on right side. Green rectangle marks clouds near visible landmass. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Argues NASA's iconic Blue Marble photograph contains cloned/duplicated cloud patterns, suggesting digital manipulation rather than authentic photograph. Implies Earth images are computer-generated composites rather than real photos from space5:T4a7,Meme about educational indoctrination featuring young student in vintage classroom setting. Shows boy with dark curly hair wearing white collared shirt with dark trim, resting face on hand with bored or skeptical expression while sitting at wooden school desk. Behind him visible green chalkboard with mathematical equations or writing in chalk. Aged photograph quality with muted bluish-gray tones gives nostalgic 1960s-70s classroom atmosphere. Top banner in gray reads 'THEY LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING' in white text. Bottom section shows red banner with white text quote: 'Illiteracy in the 21st century will not be about reading and writing, but about those who cannot unlearn what they were led to believe.' Attribution watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana' at bottom left. Argues modern education system indoctrinates rather than educates, specifically regarding globe Earth model. Suggests true literacy/intelligence requires ability to question and unlearn false information taught in schools. Uses disengaged student image to represent those trapped in educational programming. Quote emphasizes critical thinking and willingness to reject mainstream narratives as markers of genuine education0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-122","title":"Other 122","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12027550_476085282591211_231428007959650899_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-121","title":"Other 121","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10931148_487801094752963_857489831761663229_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-123","title":"Other 123","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12235136_476978399168566_5513070256571606414_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
