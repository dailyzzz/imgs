5:T476,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Coriolis Effect. Title at top reads 'The Coriolis Effect' in elegant gray font. Top panel shows military sniper in white winter camouflage and face covering looking through scope of large tactical rifle with suppressor, lying in prone shooting position. Snow or winter environment visible. White text overlay: 'SAYS THE EARTH SPINS UNDER A SNIPER'S BULLET'. Bottom panel shows vibrant collection of colorful hot air balloons floating in clear blue sky - including yellow/blue striped balloon on left, orange/black striped large balloon in center, blue balloon with stars, red balloon, balloons in various colors (yellow, green, blue, red, orange patterns). White text overlay: 'BUT IT DOESN'T SPIN UNDER THESE BALLOONS?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in cyan at bottom right. Meme argues if Coriolis Effect (Earth's rotation affecting moving objects) requires snipers to compensate for Earth's rotation when shooting long distances, then stationary hot air balloons should drift due to same rotation. Questions why balloons don't experience apparent motion if Earth rotates beneath them while suspended in air0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 122 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel comparison meme questioning Coriolis Effect.
