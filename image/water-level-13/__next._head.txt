5:T428,Three-panel soccer ball meme demonstrating water retention on different surfaces. Top panel shows inflated white soccer ball with classic black pentagon pattern on grass, labeled 'BALL DOESN'T HOLD WATER'. Middle panel shows same ball completely deflated and collapsed inward, wrinkled white leather with black patches visible, labeled 'BUT A FLAT BALL DOES'. Bottom panel shows completely flattened deflated ball pressed flat on dark surface, black panels spread out in irregular pattern. Humorous analogy arguing that spherical surfaces don't retain water (water runs off curved ball), but flat surfaces do hold water (deflated flat ball could theoretically hold water like shallow dish). Applies this observation to Earth: if Earth were spherical like inflated ball, oceans should run off curved surface, but since water stays in place, Earth must be flat like deflated ball. Uses everyday object (soccer ball) to make intuitive argument about water behavior on curved versus flat surfaces, suggesting flat Earth better explains water retention than globe model0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 13 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Three-panel soccer ball meme demonstrating water retention on different surfaces.
