3:T428,Three-panel soccer ball meme demonstrating water retention on different surfaces. Top panel shows inflated white soccer ball with classic black pentagon pattern on grass, labeled 'BALL DOESN'T HOLD WATER'. Middle panel shows same ball completely deflated and collapsed inward, wrinkled white leather with black patches visible, labeled 'BUT A FLAT BALL DOES'. Bottom panel shows completely flattened deflated ball pressed flat on dark surface, black panels spread out in irregular pattern. Humorous analogy arguing that spherical surfaces don't retain water (water runs off curved ball), but flat surfaces do hold water (deflated flat ball could theoretically hold water like shallow dish). Applies this observation to Earth: if Earth were spherical like inflated ball, oceans should run off curved surface, but since water stays in place, Earth must be flat like deflated ball. Uses everyday object (soccer ball) to make intuitive argument about water behavior on curved versus flat surfaces, suggesting flat Earth better explains water retention than globe model4:T43d,Educational meme about the Nile River with aerial photograph and wordplay. Header 'THE NILE' in white text, followed by green text: 'A RIVER THAT FLOWS NORTH OVER 4,000 MILES AGAINST THE SUPPOSED CURVE OF THE GLOBE. THIS IMPOSSIBILITY FURTHER PROVES THE EARTH IS FLAT AND WATER ALWAYS FLOWS DOWNHILL TO FIND ITS LEVEL'. Main image shows stunning aerial view of winding Nile River cutting through green landscape with agricultural fields visible on both sides. River appears as bright blue meandering path through lush green terrain under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom section shows large text 'DE-NIAL' (pun on 'denial' and 'the Nile'), followed by smaller text 'WHEN YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THIS FACT AND CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU LIVE ON A GIANT SPINNING BALL'. Photo credit 'Nick Havok'. Argues that Nile River flowing northward for 4,000+ miles contradicts spherical Earth model because water should not be able to flow 'uphill' over curved surface. Claims river's ability to flow such distance proves Earth is flat plane where water simply flows downhill following gravity to seek level5:T40a,Dramatic sunset meme showing water wave with sun reflection. Left side displays ocean wave with water droplets splashing upward, creating curved water surface. Sunset visible in background with golden sun low on horizon creating golden-orange reflection path across water. Sky shows orange and dark blue gradient. Large white text at top reads 'WHEN WATER CURVES' and bottom text states 'SO DOES THE SUNS REFLECTION'. Watermark 'mematic.net' at bottom right. Argues that when water surface curves (as in wave), sun's reflection follows that curve, creating distorted reflection path. Implies that if oceans curved over spherical Earth, sun reflections should appear distorted or impossible, but straight reflection paths observed suggest flat water surfaces. Uses wave photography to demonstrate principle that water's shape determines reflection geometry, questioning why ocean reflections appear straight if water curves over globe. Presents observable optics of curved water surfaces as evidence against large-scale ocean curvature0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-13","title":"Water Level 13","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/30582401_10213503635522657_7296528551136722944_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-12","title":"Water Level 12","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/23519351_376084966173386_5095148856683849441_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-14","title":"Water Level 14","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/31779510_384281155407109_2444981764712562688_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
