5:T652,Apollo spacecraft cutaway diagram questioning astronaut transfer between modules. Shows technical illustration of complete Apollo spacecraft stack in space against black starfield background. Diagram labeled 'SATURN V' and 'APOLLO SPACECRAFT' at top. Detailed cutaway reveals interior components and crew spaces. From left to right: conical white Command Module at front with cramped crew cabin visible inside, cylindrical Service Module behind it showing fuel tanks and engine components, narrow cylindrical tunnel/docking adapter connecting to Lunar Module. Lunar Module shown with distinctive angular gold-foil wrapped descent stage at bottom and ascent stage with crew cabin at top. Two large yellow arrows with three question marks (???) point to the narrow tunnel/passage between Command Module and Lunar Module. Labels identify major components: 'BOOST PROTECTIVE COVER', 'LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM', 'ENGINE', 'COMMAND MODULE', 'SERVICE MODULE', 'LM ADAPTER', 'LUNAR MODULE'. Top text in large yellow letters asks: 'HOW DID THE ASTRONAUTS GET FROM THE COMMAND MODULE TO THE LUNAR MODULE?' Bottom text in yellow: 'DID THEY CLIMB THROUGH THE ENGINE?' Bottom right shows 'MISC-47-MS-G-1551-G' reference number. Signature 'Nick Havok'. Moon landing skeptics question how astronauts in bulky pressurized spacesuits could fit through narrow docking tunnel to transfer between spacecraft. Actual procedure involved astronauts removing suits, crawling through 32-inch diameter tunnel in shirtsleeves after docking. Question 'climb through engine' is strawman - engine is in Service Module, separate from docking tunnel path0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 236 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo spacecraft cutaway diagram questioning astronaut transfer between modules.
