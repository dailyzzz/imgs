3:T652,Apollo spacecraft cutaway diagram questioning astronaut transfer between modules. Shows technical illustration of complete Apollo spacecraft stack in space against black starfield background. Diagram labeled 'SATURN V' and 'APOLLO SPACECRAFT' at top. Detailed cutaway reveals interior components and crew spaces. From left to right: conical white Command Module at front with cramped crew cabin visible inside, cylindrical Service Module behind it showing fuel tanks and engine components, narrow cylindrical tunnel/docking adapter connecting to Lunar Module. Lunar Module shown with distinctive angular gold-foil wrapped descent stage at bottom and ascent stage with crew cabin at top. Two large yellow arrows with three question marks (???) point to the narrow tunnel/passage between Command Module and Lunar Module. Labels identify major components: 'BOOST PROTECTIVE COVER', 'LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM', 'ENGINE', 'COMMAND MODULE', 'SERVICE MODULE', 'LM ADAPTER', 'LUNAR MODULE'. Top text in large yellow letters asks: 'HOW DID THE ASTRONAUTS GET FROM THE COMMAND MODULE TO THE LUNAR MODULE?' Bottom text in yellow: 'DID THEY CLIMB THROUGH THE ENGINE?' Bottom right shows 'MISC-47-MS-G-1551-G' reference number. Signature 'Nick Havok'. Moon landing skeptics question how astronauts in bulky pressurized spacesuits could fit through narrow docking tunnel to transfer between spacecraft. Actual procedure involved astronauts removing suits, crawling through 32-inch diameter tunnel in shirtsleeves after docking. Question 'climb through engine' is strawman - engine is in Service Module, separate from docking tunnel path4:T5f8,Density column experiment with layered liquids and objects demonstrating buoyancy. Shows tall clear glass cylinder or vase containing density tower science experiment against white background. Multiple colored liquids stacked in distinct horizontal layers from bottom to top, separated by surface tension and density differences. Bottom layer: golden-amber honey with small metal bolt resting at bottom. Second layer: tan-beige corn syrup. Third layer: darker brown (appears to be 100% maple syrup). Fourth layer: white opaque milk with popcorn kernel floating at interface. Fifth layer: clear or pale liquid (dish soap). Sixth layer: light blue-green water with red cherry tomato suspended at level. Seventh layer: clear liquid (vegetable oil). Eighth layer: purple-blue liquid (rubbing alcohol) with small plastic beads floating. Ninth layer: bright red liquid (lamp oil). Top: white ping pong ball floating on surface with white plastic soda bottle cap below it. Left side shows black text labels identifying each liquid layer. Right side shows red text labels identifying floating objects at each density level. Demonstrates principle of density and buoyancy - denser materials sink to bottom, less dense materials float on top. Each object floats at layer matching its own density. Flat Earth proponents use this to argue buoyancy and density explain rising/falling without requiring gravity. Claim objects naturally seek their density level in medium rather than being pulled by gravitational force toward planetary center5:T5b8,Two-panel comparison meme about research vs television belief. Top panel shows mysterious hooded figure in black robe or hoodie hunched over silver laptop computer against light blue-gray background. Face obscured by shadow and hood, creating anonymous hacker or researcher aesthetic. Laptop screen glows with white light. Text overlay at top reads: 'I GET MADE FUN OF FOR RESEARCHING THINGS'. Center of panel displays 'fb.com/fematters' URL. Bottom text: 'ON A COMPUTER'. Bottom panel shows young man sitting on dark blue couch or bed against beige wall. Wears tan/beige long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt. Has dark hair, slight beard, expressionless or skeptical face looking toward camera with deadpan stare. Arms rest at sides in relaxed position against cushions. Body language suggests apathy or resignation. White text at bottom reads: 'BY PEOPLE WHO BLINDLY BELIEVE WHAT THEY SEE ON TELEVISION'. Meme contrasts active research using internet resources versus passive acceptance of television programming. Flat Earth community uses this to portray themselves as independent investigators unfairly ridiculed by mainstream society that uncritically accepts media narratives. Suggests television viewers are intellectually lazy while internet researchers are pursuing truth. References cultural tension between alternative media consumers and traditional news audiences. Implies flat Earth conclusions result from diligent research rather than conspiracy thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-236","title":"Other 236","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670496_485633281636411_4050423841817880851_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-235","title":"Other 235","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670100_463799087153164_5975624137514349673_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-237","title":"Other 237","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670728_482421525290920_6743353139010463388_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
