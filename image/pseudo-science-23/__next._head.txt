5:T6cb,Educational infographic with bright blue background explaining Airy's Failure experiment and stellar aberration. Top shows white box with diagram labeled 'Fig. 2. The moving and stationary tubes (telescopes)' depicting two telescope configurations: left showing tilted telescope labeled 'Velocity of Rain = (>=speed of starlight)' with 'Tilt angle' and 'Moving tube (Earth's motion)' marked as diagram A; right showing vertical telescope labeled 'Stationary tube - (geocentric telescope)' with red text 'Water filled telescope-starlight slowed down' marked as diagram B. Both show rain/light angle comparisons. Bottom text in white on blue: 'To see whether it is the telescope or the stars that are moving, all you have to do is to fill the telescope with water which greatly slows down the light when it is in the telescope. If it is the telescope that is moving, then you have to tip the telescope a little further because of the slower speed of the light in the telescope. However, if it is the stars that are moving and you use a stationary telescope, then the telescope does NOT have to be tipped any further because the starlight is coming in at the correct angle anyway. THAT AIREY FAILED TO FIND ANY FURTHER TIPPING WAS NEEDED PROVED THAT IT WAS THE TELESCOPE AND THEREFORE THE EARTH THAT WAS STATIONARY. This important conclusion was not even mentioned in his report, it was too explosive!' Describes George Airy's 1871 water-filled telescope experiment testing stellar aberration, claiming it proved stationary Earth. Misinterprets results: experiment actually confirmed stellar aberration occurs as predicted for moving Earth due to light speed constancy, contradicting aether theory but supporting Earth's motion through space.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 23 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational infographic with bright blue background explaining Airy's Failure experiment and stellar aberration.
