3:T6cb,Educational infographic with bright blue background explaining Airy's Failure experiment and stellar aberration. Top shows white box with diagram labeled 'Fig. 2. The moving and stationary tubes (telescopes)' depicting two telescope configurations: left showing tilted telescope labeled 'Velocity of Rain = (>=speed of starlight)' with 'Tilt angle' and 'Moving tube (Earth's motion)' marked as diagram A; right showing vertical telescope labeled 'Stationary tube - (geocentric telescope)' with red text 'Water filled telescope-starlight slowed down' marked as diagram B. Both show rain/light angle comparisons. Bottom text in white on blue: 'To see whether it is the telescope or the stars that are moving, all you have to do is to fill the telescope with water which greatly slows down the light when it is in the telescope. If it is the telescope that is moving, then you have to tip the telescope a little further because of the slower speed of the light in the telescope. However, if it is the stars that are moving and you use a stationary telescope, then the telescope does NOT have to be tipped any further because the starlight is coming in at the correct angle anyway. THAT AIREY FAILED TO FIND ANY FURTHER TIPPING WAS NEEDED PROVED THAT IT WAS THE TELESCOPE AND THEREFORE THE EARTH THAT WAS STATIONARY. This important conclusion was not even mentioned in his report, it was too explosive!' Describes George Airy's 1871 water-filled telescope experiment testing stellar aberration, claiming it proved stationary Earth. Misinterprets results: experiment actually confirmed stellar aberration occurs as predicted for moving Earth due to light speed constancy, contradicting aether theory but supporting Earth's motion through space.4:T47f,Two-panel meme featuring Carl Sagan quote about evidence standards. Top panel shows Carl Sagan in suit and tie smiling at camera with planets/space background (moons or planets visible). Quote in white text: '"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."' with attribution 'Carl Sagan' in lower right. Bottom panel shows animated/CGI diagram of heliocentric solar system model with large yellow Sun at center, multiple blue circular orbital paths with small planets, white motion trails showing orbital trajectories creating complex looping patterns, Earth visible as small blue sphere. Text 'MEES NOT FILMATIC' in lower right corner. Juxtaposes Sagan's famous skeptical quote with heliocentric model, implying that Earth orbiting Sun is extraordinary claim lacking extraordinary evidence. Ironically uses Sagan's own standard to challenge mainstream astronomy, suggesting heliocentric model should be questioned using same skeptical criteria Sagan advocated for pseudoscientific claims. Reverses Sagan's intended application - he used this principle to critique fringe theories, not established science with centuries of supporting evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-23","title":"Pseudo Science 23","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/34366417_1990712477637671_4202902588951101440_o.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-22","title":"Pseudo Science 22","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/29541049_10212962603637705_8083333825302521017_n.jpeg","description":"Satirical meme showing close-up black and white photograph of Albert Einstein with characteristic wild gray hair, mustache, staring intensely at camera.

Bottom caption in large white text: 'The jesuits took him from zero to hero'. Conspiracy theory meme alleging Einstein had no legitimate scientific accomplishments and was promoted from obscurity to fame by Jesuit order (Catholic religious organization). Claims Einstein's theories were fraudulent and his prominence was manufactured by religious conspiracy rather than earned through scientific work. Ignores Einstein's documented contributions including special relativity (1905), general relativity (1915), photoelectric effect (Nobel Prize 1921), and numerous other papers. Presents anti-Einstein, anti-relativity conspiracy narrative suggesting Jesuit control of scientific establishment and fabrication of modern physics."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-24","title":"Pseudo Science 24","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/36711022_1713312795383237_3071697611518902272_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
