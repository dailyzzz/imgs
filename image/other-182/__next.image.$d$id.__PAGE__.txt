3:T4b8,Space photography Hollywood basement conspiracy meme. Black space background. Upper portion shows International Space Station (ISS) with distinctive white/gray modules, gold solar panel arrays extending outward, various components and structures visible against black void. Lower portion shows Space Shuttle orbiter in white with black heat tiles, distinctive delta wing shape, tail vertical stabilizer, approaching or near curved Earth showing blue oceans, white clouds, brown-green landmasses. Top text in bold white letters: 'SPACE MAY BE THE FINAL FRONTIER'. Bottom text: 'BUT IT'S MADE IN A HOLLYWOOD BASEMENT.' References Red Hot Chili Peppers song 'Californication' lyrics about Hollywood's manufactured reality. Argues all space imagery (ISS, shuttle, Earth photos) is filmed in movie studios rather than actual space. 'Hollywood basement' suggests low-budget deception - not even main soundstage but basement. Implies space program is entertainment production rather than scientific endeavor. Questions authenticity of all NASA/space agency imagery as special effects and CGI rather than real photography from orbit. Connects space exploration to Hollywood's history of creating convincing illusions4:T504,Apollo Lunar Module construction materials skepticism meme. Shows close-up photograph of Apollo LM (Lunar Module) in space or on moon with black space background. Module displays distinctive gold/bronze metallic thermal foil covering, angular geometric shape with flat panels, landing legs visible at bottom. Gray/silver structural elements, black shadows create harsh contrast. Module appears fragile, makeshift with wrinkled foil, exposed framework, various protrusions and antennae. Top text in bold white letters: 'NASA CLAIMS THEY WENT TO THE MOON IN THIS...' Bottom text: 'IF YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE FOIL, TAPE, AND CURTAIN RODS.' Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skepticism questioning spacecraft's construction quality and materials. Mocks LM's appearance as flimsy, homemade-looking craft assembled from household materials. 'Curtain rods' reference disparages structural elements as looking like bathroom fixtures rather than space-grade engineering. Argues module appears too primitive/fragile to survive space travel, radiation, moon landing. Conspiracy theorists point to wrinkled foil and visible tape as evidence of studio prop rather than functional spacecraft. Questions how such apparently crude construction could withstand claimed journey5:T4d2,Rosetta/Philae comet landing mission infographic from European Space Agency. Educational diagram showing November 12, 2014 landing sequence of Philae lander on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Black space background with stars. Top left shows Rosetta orbiter and Philae lander separation. White text: 'Philae operational after a difficult landing'. Center shows large gray irregular-shaped comet (potato/duck-shaped) with rough rocky surface texture. Three numbered yellow boxes mark events: '1. 15:33 - Hits the surface at 1m/s in planned location, Two anchor harpoons fail to deploy, First bounce'. '2. 17:26 - Second bounce, Displaced 1km from point of impact'. '3. 17:33 - Immobilisation, Leaning at 30% angle, Stuck in rocky zone partly in shadow'. Curved dotted lines show bounce trajectory. Speed annotations '38 cm/s' and '3 cm/s'. Bottom shows gray cratered surface with blue Philae lander and 'camera' label. Right sidebar lists technical details about mission status, scientific instruments, data transmission, battery, solar panels. Lower right text 'Use of drill put on hold'. First spacecraft to land on comet nucleus. Historic achievement in space exploration demonstrating orbital mechanics and rendezvous capabilities0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-182","title":"Other 182","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12524295_458833000983106_1675931569722510132_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-181","title":"Other 181","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12523054_455800094619730_8223789282222809336_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-183","title":"Other 183","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525322_455841524615587_7426993136374706724_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
