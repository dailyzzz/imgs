5:T215c,Pirates of the Caribbean meme with Captain Jack Sparrow using telescope, sarcastically asking if telescope can "drag ship back over the curve of the Earth." Flat Earth meme using movie screenshot to mock globe Earth explanation that ships disappearing over horizon can be "brought back" by zooming with telescope or camera. Image presents flat Earth argument that if ships disappear due to curvature, magnification shouldn't be able to restore visibility. MOVIE STILL: Screenshot from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise showing two characters on ship or dock. Scene appears to be from first film "The Curse of the Black Pearl" (2003) or early sequel. Characters positioned looking out over water - appropriate context for ship-watching/telescope use. LEFT CHARACTER - CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW: Iconic Johnny Depp portrayal of eccentric pirate captain. Distinctive appearance: Dark dreadlocked hair with beads and trinkets woven throughout. Bandana/headscarf covering top of head. Thick black eyeliner/kohl around eyes - characteristic Jack Sparrow look. Facial hair including mustache and small goatee. Weather-worn skin suggesting life at sea. Holding BRASS TELESCOPE to eye, looking through it toward horizon. Classic nautical pose of captain scanning for ships. Expression partially obscured by telescope but appears focused. Wearing typical Jack Sparrow costume - period pirate attire with multiple layers. RIGHT CHARACTER - WILL TURNER: Orlando Bloom's character - young blacksmith turned pirate. Clean-cut appearance contrasting with Jack Sparrow's disheveled look. Dark hair pulled back. Lighter skin, youthful features. White/cream colored shirt typical of period costume. Looking toward Jack with expression suggesting skepticism or confusion. Standing close, observing Jack's telescope use. Character dynamic suggests questioning or conversation between the two. WATER BACKGROUND: Ocean/sea visible behind characters. Horizon line where water meets sky. Blue-gray water stretching to distance. Scene likely set in Caribbean waters based on film setting. This maritime context makes image relevant to flat Earth ship-over-horizon discussions. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text in white Impact font with black outline reads: "SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN DRAG THAT SHIP BACK OVER THE CURVE OF THE EARTH WITH NOTHING BUT THAT MAGIC TELESCOPE?" Sarcastic question format mocking globe Earth proponents who claim zooming in can restore visibility of ships that disappeared over horizon. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SHIPS DISAPPEAR BOTTOM-FIRST: Globe Earth proponents cite ships disappearing hull-first over horizon as evidence of Earth's curvature. Bottom disappears before mast because curvature progressively blocks lower portions from view. 2) ZOOM BRINGS SHIPS BACK: Flat Earthers counter that zooming with telescope, binoculars, or camera can often "bring back" ships that appeared to disappear. If ship truly went "over" curve, no amount of magnification should restore it. But zoom does work (sometimes), therefore Earth isn't curved, ships just got too far for naked eye to see. 3) "MAGIC TELESCOPE" SARCASM: Meme mocks globe Earth explanation by sarcastically calling telescope "magic" - implying globe believers must invoke magical properties to explain how zoom works. If Earth were curved, telescope couldn't see over/around curve. Since zoom does reveal ships, either Earth is flat or telescope has magical curve-bending powers. 4) PERSPECTIVE VS CURVATURE: Flat Earth explanation is that ships disappear due to perspective/angular resolution limits of human eye, not curvature. At sufficient distance, objects become too small to resolve. Magnification (telescope) increases angular size, making distant objects visible again. No curve involved - just perspective limits at extreme distances. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) ANGULAR RESOLUTION: Human eye does have limited angular resolution (~1 arcminute). Distant objects appear smaller due to perspective. Eventually object appears so small it's below eye's resolution limit - appears to vanish even though still technically visible if magnified. This is real phenomenon. 2) BUT ALSO CURVATURE: Earth's curvature ADDITIONALLY blocks objects at distance. At sea level, horizon is approximately 3 miles away. Beyond horizon, objects are physically blocked by Earth's curve - not just too small to see. These are separate phenomena that both occur. 3) BOTTOM-FIRST DISAPPEARANCE: If only perspective mattered, entire ship would shrink uniformly and fade away. Instead, ships disappear BOTTOM-FIRST - hull vanishes while mast remains visible. This proves curvature blocking, not just perspective shrinking. Magnification cannot bring back bottom portion already blocked by curve. 4) PARTIAL RESTORATION: Sometimes zooming PARTIALLY restores ship visibility because: Ship wasn't fully beyond curve yet (only appeared to vanish due to angular resolution); Atmospheric refraction bent light over curve (temporarily); Ship was in atmospheric mirage zone; Observer was viewing ship that appeared to sink but was still above geometric horizon. But once ship is truly beyond curve, no magnification restores it. 5) PREDICTABLE MATHEMATICS: Distance to horizon and amount of curvature drop are precisely calculable. At any given observer height and target distance, exact amount of object blocked by curve is predictable. These calculations match observations perfectly, confirming both Earth's radius and spherical geometry. 6) REPEATABLE EXPERIMENTS: Multiple controlled experiments have documented ships, buildings, landmarks disappearing bottom-first at predicted distances, with magnification unable to restore blocked portions. Bedford Level experiment, Lake Pontchartrain causeway observations, and many others confirm curvature effects as distinct from perspective effects. MEME FORMAT ANALYSIS: Using popular movie characters makes meme engaging and shareable. Jack Sparrow associated with cleverness, seeing through deception - suggesting flat Earthers are similarly perceptive. Will Turner's skeptical expression represents globe believer being challenged. Question format invites viewer to consider "gotcha" argument. Sarcasm ("magic telescope") mocks opposition as believing absurdities. Effective for in-group humor but misrepresents actual science of perspective vs curvature. CHARACTER CHOICE: Jack Sparrow is sympathetic anti-hero - clever, unconventional thinker who sees truths others miss. Perfect avatar for flat Earthers who see themselves as independent thinkers challenging mainstream dogma. Pirates as outsiders questioning authority parallels flat Earth self-image as truth-seekers challenging scientific establishment. Telescope prop is convenient for ship-watching topic. Will Turner represents naive believer being educated by wiser Jack - meme positions flat Earther as wise teacher, globe believer as confused student. IMGFLIP WATERMARK: Small "imgflip.com" watermark visible in lower left indicates meme created using Imgflip meme generator - popular online tool for creating image macros. Suggests meme created by amateur rather than professional content producer. Typical of grassroots flat Earth content creation. VISUAL RHETORIC: Movie still provides emotional/narrative context that pure text argument lacks. Viewers familiar with Pirates films bring positive associations with characters. Format is immediately recognizable as internet meme - genre signals humor/satire rather than serious argument. Works as "thought-terminating" content - instead of researching perspective vs curvature, viewer remembers funny meme and dismisses globe Earth explanation as absurd. Attribution: fb.com/fematters watermark identifies flat Earth community source. Content designed to mock globe Earth proponents and provide shareable argument for flat Earth believers. FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING: Meme conflates two separate phenomena (perspective limits and curvature blocking) and presents telescope success in overcoming perspective limits as disproving curvature. But these are independent effects. Telescope CAN overcome perspective limits (making small things appear larger). Telescope CANNOT overcome curvature blocking (cannot see around/over physical obstruction). Flat Earthers document cases where zoom helped (perspective was limiting factor) and ignore cases where zoom failed (curvature was blocking factor). Cherry-picking confirms flat Earth belief while actual controlled experiments confirm both phenomena exist and match spherical Earth predictions.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 384 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Pirates of the Caribbean meme with Captain Jack Sparrow using telescope, sarcastically asking if telescope can \"drag ship back over the curve of the Earth.\" ..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 384"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Pirates of the Caribbean meme with Captain Jack Sparrow using telescope, sarcastically asking if telescope can \"drag ship back over the curve of the Earth.\" ..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12931101_485904108275995_1625534449377818811_n.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
