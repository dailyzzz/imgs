3:T504,Stunning sunset beach scene with philosophical text about water retention on spinning Earth. Shows spectacular twilight sky with layered clouds in shades of blue, pink, orange, and golden yellow creating dramatic atmospheric display. Silhouettes of approximately 20 people riding camels in single file across wet beach sand, perfectly reflected in shallow water below creating mirror symmetry. Ocean horizon visible in background with gentle waves. Sky shows complex cloud formations with light streaming through gaps. Top white text reads: 'If the Earth were a globe, rolling and dashing through "space" at the rate of "a hundred miles in five seconds of time."' Bottom white text states: 'the waters of seas and oceans could not, by any known law, be kept on its surface - the assertion that they could be retained under these circumstances being an outrage upon human understanding and credulity!' Bottom right watermark 'JM'. Argues that Earth's supposed high rotational velocity (derived from 1000 mph equatorial speed) would make water retention physically impossible on curved spinning surface. Questions how gravity could hold oceans against such extreme centrifugal forces. Uses serene beach reflection scene ironically to emphasize water's observable stillness and levelness0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-114","title":"Other 114","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10394586_477735822426157_7723607760489303489_n.jpg","description":"Magic trick metaphor meme with golden/yellow gradient background. Shows white-gloved hand holding black magician's wand with white tip, pulling spherical Earth (blue marble image showing continents and white clouds) out of classic black top hat.

Second line: 'Whatever it may be, it won't be the truth.' Bottom left shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' watermark. Uses classic magic trick imagery (rabbit from hat) to suggest globe Earth is illusion created by those in power rather than observable reality. Implies mainstream cosmology is deliberate deception designed to control public perception regardless of truth.

Brown/maroon background. Image captures Tony Stark/Iron Man actor's trademark sardonic look of disbelief. Top text in white bold letters: 'THE FACE YOU MAKE'. Bottom text: 'WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' with 'JM' logo. Popular meme format expressing skepticism toward claims of personally observing Earth's curvature from commercial airplanes or high altitude. Suggests such claims are either mistaken, exaggerated, or dishonest since curvature requires much higher altitude than passenger flights to be visible. Uses Downey Jr.'s incredulous expression to convey doubt about everyday curvature sightings, implying horizon always appears flat to human observers at accessible altitudes"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
