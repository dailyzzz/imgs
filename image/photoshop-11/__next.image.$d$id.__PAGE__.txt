3:T429,Educational poster with blue header text: 'No matter where you view the earth from above, the curvature of the earth proves it's round. After thousands of years, the idea of a flat earth is still wrong.' Shows 3x3 grid of nine ISS (International Space Station) photographs of Earth from orbit, each labeled: 'ISS over Australia' (showing glowing blue landmass at night), 'Pacific Ocean' (showing sun reflection on water), 'ISS over North America' (showing continent with city lights), 'ISS over the Nile and Red Sea' (showing river and lights), 'ISS over Moscow, Russia' (showing nighttime city lights), 'Europe to East Asia' (showing extensive golden city lights), 'ISS over the Arctic Ocean' (showing aurora/northern lights in green), 'ISS over Southern Africa' (showing cloud formations), 'ISS over the Antarctic' (showing ice shelf/polar region from above). All images show curved Earth horizon with black space above, demonstrating visible curvature from orbital altitude. Presents photographic evidence of Earth's spherical shape from multiple viewing angles.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"photoshop-11","title":"Photoshop 11","category":"photoshop","categoryDisplay":"Photoshop","src":"/images/gallery/photoshop/image-23.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'THE MAGIC BALL EARTH' with black background.
