5:T4ff,Beach sunset silhouette with water level proverb. Shows peaceful beach scene at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from blue-gray at top transitioning through orange-yellow tones to bright golden sun at horizon. Sun partially visible above horizon line creating bright reflection column stretching across wet sand/shallow water toward viewer. Calm water or wet sand creates mirror-like surface reflecting sky colors. Three silhouetted figures in foreground - adult standing on left leading horse by rope/reins, small child in middle, horse on right walking through shallow water. All figures appear as black silhouettes against illuminated background. Reflections visible in wet sand below. Horizon appears perfectly flat where sky meets water/land. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN LEAD A MAN TO WATER'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM SEE IT ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL AND FLAT'. Left side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Parodies 'you can lead a horse to water but can't make him drink' proverb. Argues truth about water's levelness (and by extension flat Earth) is obvious to those willing to observe, but many refuse to see despite evidence right in front of them. Uses horse leading metaphor for futility of convincing closed-minded people0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 187 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Beach sunset silhouette with water level proverb.
