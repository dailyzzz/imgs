3:T4ff,Beach sunset silhouette with water level proverb. Shows peaceful beach scene at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from blue-gray at top transitioning through orange-yellow tones to bright golden sun at horizon. Sun partially visible above horizon line creating bright reflection column stretching across wet sand/shallow water toward viewer. Calm water or wet sand creates mirror-like surface reflecting sky colors. Three silhouetted figures in foreground - adult standing on left leading horse by rope/reins, small child in middle, horse on right walking through shallow water. All figures appear as black silhouettes against illuminated background. Reflections visible in wet sand below. Horizon appears perfectly flat where sky meets water/land. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN LEAD A MAN TO WATER'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM SEE IT ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL AND FLAT'. Left side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Parodies 'you can lead a horse to water but can't make him drink' proverb. Argues truth about water's levelness (and by extension flat Earth) is obvious to those willing to observe, but many refuse to see despite evidence right in front of them. Uses horse leading metaphor for futility of convincing closed-minded people4:T462,Massive tabular iceberg in Antarctic waters showing ice wall concept. Photograph shows enormous flat-topped iceberg with perfectly level horizontal surface. Ice formation appears bright white with subtle blue tints. Top surface remarkably flat and smooth like tabletop extending across width of image. Vertical ice cliff face shows horizontal stratification layers from snow/ice compression over millennia. Face appears sheer and perpendicular to water surface. Small chunks of broken ice visible at waterline. Dark gray-blue ocean water in foreground shows gentle waves and ripples. Overcast gray sky creates moody atmosphere. Background shows more ice formations fading into atmospheric haze. Tabular icebergs form when large sections break off Antarctic ice shelf. This type commonly cited by flat Earth proponents as evidence of ice wall surrounding Earth's edge. Argues Antarctica isn't continent at bottom of globe but circular ice wall encircling flat Earth plane, preventing water from flowing off edges and keeping civilizations contained in center disk. Perfectly flat top surface reinforces flat plane cosmology5:T47b,Jackie Chan confused meme questioning measurable curvature. Shows action star Jackie Chan in gray knit sweater with white collar visible. Both hands pressed against sides of head in classic confused/mind-blown gesture. Dark black hair slightly messy. Facial expression shows bewilderment - eyes squinting, mouth slightly open, eyebrows furrowed. Blurred gray background suggests indoor setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'CURVED EARTH'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN'T MEASURE CURVATURE? WHAT?' Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses popular Jackie Chan confusion meme format to express logical contradiction. Argues if Earth is truly curved sphere, curvature should be measurable through surveying, laser tests, or visual observation at distance. Points out that despite claims of 8 inches per mile squared curvature formula, real-world measurements consistently show flat/level surfaces over long distances (bridges, canals, railways, etc.). Jackie Chan's exaggerated confusion represents flat Earth believers' frustration with lack of empirical curvature evidence despite scientific claims0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-187","title":"Other 187","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525466_477585052441234_5437057402681444586_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-186","title":"Other 186","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525409_461770357356037_945031612290821477_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-188","title":"Other 188","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525608_454927778040295_8453190053080103105_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
