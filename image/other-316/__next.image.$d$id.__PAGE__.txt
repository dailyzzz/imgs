3:Tab0,Halley's Comet speed comparison with Earth and sun questioning why sun doesn't have tail. Two-panel astronomical comparison with text questioning solar mechanics. Top text in white across black background: 'IF HALLEY'S COMET TRAVELS AT 157,838 MPH' (left) and 'AND WE ARE TRAVELING AROUND THE SUN AT 67,000 MPH WHILE THE SUN IS TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE AT 45,000 MPH' (right). Left panel shows photograph of Halley's Comet in night sky - brilliant comet with bright white-blue nucleus and spectacular luminous tail streaming away. Tail shows classic parabolic shape extending across starfield - combination of ion tail (blue) and dust tail (white-yellow) stretching millions of miles. Comet appears against deep blue-black space with scattered white stars. Tail shows diffuse glow with brighter regions and fainter outer edges. Nucleus appears as bright concentrated point. Photo captures comet during one of its 75-76 year orbital passes through inner solar system (last visible 1986, next 2061). Right panel shows bright sun in clear blue daytime sky - brilliant white-yellow solar disc with prominent lens flare creating starburst effect with multiple rays radiating outward. Camera lens flare shows hexagonal internal reflections creating colorful artifacts (lens element shape). Sky shows gradient from deeper blue at top to lighter blue near sun. Thin wispy white clouds visible in lower portion. Sun appears as blinding bright point source requiring camera exposure compensation. Lower left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Lower right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'WHY DOESN'T THE SUN HAVE A TAIL?' Meme argues if comets develop tails from high-speed motion through space, and sun travels through space at high velocity, sun should also have visible tail. However, this misunderstands comet tail mechanics. Comet tails form from solar wind and radiation pressure stripping material from comet nucleus as it approaches sun - NOT from motion through space. Comets are icy bodies that sublimate (turn directly from solid to gas) when heated by sun. Solar wind (charged particles from sun) and radiation pressure push released gas and dust away from nucleus forming tail always pointing AWAY from sun regardless of comet's direction of travel. Sun doesn't have tail because it's SOURCE of solar wind, not recipient. Sun does have corona (visible during eclipses) and solar wind extends throughout solar system. Sun's motion through galaxy doesn't create tail visible from Earth because: 1) We're moving with sun (same reference frame), 2) Interstellar medium extremely sparse unlike gas/dust near comets, 3) Sun is active energy source, not passive reflector like comet4:Tafd,Apollo moon landing versus film studio set comparison suggesting moon missions were faked. Two-panel comparison photograph implying moon landings were filmed on Earth rather than lunar surface. Left panel shows iconic Apollo moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit standing on lunar surface beside Lunar Module descent stage. Astronaut salutes American flag planted in gray lunar soil. Flag appears to wave despite no atmosphere. Golden-foil wrapped LM visible with ladder, landing legs, various equipment. Surface shows gray regolith (moon dust/rock), bootprints visible. Harsh shadows suggest single light source (sun). Black sky with no visible stars. Scene lit with high contrast typical of lunar photography. Right panel shows film studio or production stage - large indoor facility with high ceilings, industrial lighting rigs visible overhead. Set dressed to resemble lunar surface with gray artificial terrain/sand. Full-scale mockup of Lunar Module visible - gold foil wrapped descent stage identical to real LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit (or costume) standing on set. American flag planted in fake regolith. Large green screen visible in background for chroma key compositing. Studio floor, lighting equipment, scaffolding, crew/equipment visible around edges showing clearly artificial environment. Multiple overhead lights creating studio lighting setup. Bottom text spans both panels in large bold white letters on black background: 'YOU CAN FOOL ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME IF YOUR EFFECTS BUDGET IS LARGE ENOUGH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Quote plays on Abraham Lincoln's famous saying 'You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.' Meme argues moon landings were elaborate hoax using Hollywood special effects. Right panel shows genuine film set or museum exhibit recreating moon landing for educational/entertainment purposes - common for documentaries, movies, museums to build replicas. However, comparing training mockup or film recreation to actual moon landing photos doesn't prove hoax. Apollo missions produced 8,400+ photos, 7 hours of video, 842 pounds of lunar samples (returned by 6 different missions), retroreflectors still used today for laser ranging experiments, testimony from 400,000+ NASA employees/contractors, independent verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary who tracked missions), ongoing satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible, and technological impossibility of faking continuous live TV broadcasts with 1960s effects technology. Studio photo shows what WOULD be needed to fake it - but such sets used for training, education, or recreation of historical events, not original footage5:Ta2d,Airplane window sunset photograph with flat horizon used as flat Earth evidence. Passenger photograph taken from commercial aircraft window during sunset/sunrise showing horizon line. Lower portion shows dark gray airplane wing extending from left side - visible winglet (upturned wing tip) creating distinctive curved profile against sky. Wing shows typical modern airliner design with smooth aerodynamic contours. Small white rivets or fasteners visible along wing surface in neat rows. Wing positioned in lower third of frame. Middle section displays layer of clouds below aircraft - dark gray-purple cloud layer appearing flat and uniform extending to horizon creating distinct separation between cloud deck and sky above. Clouds show textured surface with slight variations suggesting aircraft flying above weather system. Upper portion shows sky during golden hour - beautiful gradient from warm orange-red-pink tones near horizon transitioning through yellow-gold band into cooler blue-gray in upper atmosphere. Sun visible as bright orange-red disc sitting exactly on horizon line where sky meets clouds/Earth surface. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level extending horizontally across entire frame. No visible curvature apparent at this altitude or focal length. Sky clear and haze-free near horizon allowing crisp view. Lower center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in gray. Image taken from cruising altitude approximately 30,000-40,000 feet. Common flat Earth argument uses such photos claiming horizon appears flat proving Earth is flat. However, several factors explain straight horizon: 1) Aircraft altitude insufficient to show noticeable curvature - at 40,000 feet, curvature exists but subtle (about 3 degrees across field of view), 2) Standard camera lenses compress perspective making subtle curves appear straight, 3) Limited field of view doesn't capture wide enough horizon arc to show curve, 4) Atmospheric refraction and haze can obscure distant curve. Curvature becomes obvious at 50,000+ feet, clearly visible from 60,000+ feet (weather balloons, SR-71), and dramatic from space. Pilots with wide cockpit windows DO observe curvature at cruise altitude. Mathematical calculation: at 40,000 feet with ~120 degree field of view, horizon curve is approximately 3.1 degrees - noticeable but not dramatic, easily appearing straight in narrow photos. Commercial aircraft themselves prove spherical Earth through navigation - flight computers use spherical trigonometry for great circle routes, GPS satellites require general relativity corrections assuming spherical Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-316","title":"Other 316","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771994_466553700211036_111999275536200011_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-315","title":"Other 315","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771936_469135936619479_7813187085681480870_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-317","title":"Other 317","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12783804_468176956715377_8626539830463190875_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
