5:Tab0,Halley's Comet speed comparison with Earth and sun questioning why sun doesn't have tail. Two-panel astronomical comparison with text questioning solar mechanics. Top text in white across black background: 'IF HALLEY'S COMET TRAVELS AT 157,838 MPH' (left) and 'AND WE ARE TRAVELING AROUND THE SUN AT 67,000 MPH WHILE THE SUN IS TRAVELING THROUGH SPACE AT 45,000 MPH' (right). Left panel shows photograph of Halley's Comet in night sky - brilliant comet with bright white-blue nucleus and spectacular luminous tail streaming away. Tail shows classic parabolic shape extending across starfield - combination of ion tail (blue) and dust tail (white-yellow) stretching millions of miles. Comet appears against deep blue-black space with scattered white stars. Tail shows diffuse glow with brighter regions and fainter outer edges. Nucleus appears as bright concentrated point. Photo captures comet during one of its 75-76 year orbital passes through inner solar system (last visible 1986, next 2061). Right panel shows bright sun in clear blue daytime sky - brilliant white-yellow solar disc with prominent lens flare creating starburst effect with multiple rays radiating outward. Camera lens flare shows hexagonal internal reflections creating colorful artifacts (lens element shape). Sky shows gradient from deeper blue at top to lighter blue near sun. Thin wispy white clouds visible in lower portion. Sun appears as blinding bright point source requiring camera exposure compensation. Lower left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Lower right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'WHY DOESN'T THE SUN HAVE A TAIL?' Meme argues if comets develop tails from high-speed motion through space, and sun travels through space at high velocity, sun should also have visible tail. However, this misunderstands comet tail mechanics. Comet tails form from solar wind and radiation pressure stripping material from comet nucleus as it approaches sun - NOT from motion through space. Comets are icy bodies that sublimate (turn directly from solid to gas) when heated by sun. Solar wind (charged particles from sun) and radiation pressure push released gas and dust away from nucleus forming tail always pointing AWAY from sun regardless of comet's direction of travel. Sun doesn't have tail because it's SOURCE of solar wind, not recipient. Sun does have corona (visible during eclipses) and solar wind extends throughout solar system. Sun's motion through galaxy doesn't create tail visible from Earth because: 1) We're moving with sun (same reference frame), 2) Interstellar medium extremely sparse unlike gas/dust near comets, 3) Sun is active energy source, not passive reflector like comet0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 316 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Halley's Comet speed comparison with Earth and sun questioning why sun doesn't have tail.
