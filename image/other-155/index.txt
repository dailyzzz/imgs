13:T538,Nikola Tesla quote over vintage scientific illustration collage. Black and white image shows complex technical background with geometric patterns, grid systems, scientific instruments, spiral designs. Left side shows figure (possibly Tesla) working at desk with papers/equipment. Center shows large spiral/coil design. Right side displays vintage electrical equipment, light bulb, measuring devices. White text overlay reads: 'Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. Nikola Tesla'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Quote from famous inventor Nikola Tesla criticizes modern theoretical physics for prioritizing mathematical models over empirical observation and experimentation. Applied to flat Earth context, argues mainstream astronomy relies too heavily on abstract mathematics (gravity calculations, orbital mechanics) rather than direct sensory evidence (Earth appears flat, water is level). Suggests Tesla's experimental approach would support flat Earth over globe model. Uses Tesla's authority as legendary inventor/scientist to legitimize questioning mainstream cosmology. Vintage scientific imagery creates association with classical empiricism versus modern abstraction14:T45e,Whimsical illustrated poem in Shel Silverstein style about flat Earth edge. White background with black ink line drawings. Title at top: 'THE EDGE OF THE WORLD'. Poem text reads: 'Columbus said the world is round? / Don't you believe a word of that. / For I've been down to the edge of the world, / Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled, / Peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls, / And I can tell you, boys and girls, / The world is FLAT!' Illustration shows flat Earth edge scene with various whimsical elements: left side shows city skyline with buildings and church spires, signpost reading 'THE EDGE', floating objects suggesting items falling off edge, running dog or creature, fire hydrant, trash can, figure sitting/peering over edge on right side. Playful sketch style with loose pen strokes. Bottom right: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses children's poetry format to present flat Earth in accessible, non-threatening way. References Columbus myth while claiming first-hand experience of world's edge. Whimsical tone makes controversial topic seem innocent and imaginative rather than confrontational15:T579,Vintage educational map poster from CBS American School of the Air. Decorative beige/cream border with ornate corner designs. Header banner reads 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with subtitle 'AIR MAP OF THE WORLD - A POLAR PROJECTION'. Top corners show two small traditional globe projections. Center features large azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center, showing all continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink/salmon (North America), yellow (Asia), orange (Europe), green (South America, Africa, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. Curved flight paths/routes drawn across map connecting various cities. Outer ring marked with yellow circles indicating time zones or sun positions. Bottom left shows grid reference chart. Bottom center displays vintage CBS microphone illustration. Right side contains lengthy text explaining map's educational purpose and CBS programming details. Bottom text: 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with broadcast dates '15th Season October 12, 1945-April 26, 1946'. Historical educational material using azimuthal equidistant projection for radio broadcasting and aviation. Bottom watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Flat Earth proponents cite vintage educational use of this projection as evidence authorities knew Earth's true shape, though projection is standard for polar aviation/radio regardless of Earth's actual shape9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-155","title":"Other 155","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12473843_454098494789890_4607171506378368323_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-154","title":"Other 154","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12472260_455802364619503_7030039292681837275_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-156","title":"Other 156","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12484610_455543597978713_2113885493044286911_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
