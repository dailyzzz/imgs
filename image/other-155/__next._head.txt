5:T538,Nikola Tesla quote over vintage scientific illustration collage. Black and white image shows complex technical background with geometric patterns, grid systems, scientific instruments, spiral designs. Left side shows figure (possibly Tesla) working at desk with papers/equipment. Center shows large spiral/coil design. Right side displays vintage electrical equipment, light bulb, measuring devices. White text overlay reads: 'Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. Nikola Tesla'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Quote from famous inventor Nikola Tesla criticizes modern theoretical physics for prioritizing mathematical models over empirical observation and experimentation. Applied to flat Earth context, argues mainstream astronomy relies too heavily on abstract mathematics (gravity calculations, orbital mechanics) rather than direct sensory evidence (Earth appears flat, water is level). Suggests Tesla's experimental approach would support flat Earth over globe model. Uses Tesla's authority as legendary inventor/scientist to legitimize questioning mainstream cosmology. Vintage scientific imagery creates association with classical empiricism versus modern abstraction0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 155 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Nikola Tesla quote over vintage scientific illustration collage.
