3:Te8e,"Not bad" meme format mocking Barack Obama, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson using pear-shaped Earth reference. Two-panel vertical meme using popular Obama "not bad" reaction image format. Top panel shows President Barack Obama in dark suit with presidential seal visible on left edge, American flag in background. Obama holds left hand up in dismissive stopping gesture near face, expression showing skepticism or rejection. Gray/neutral background. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY" - suggesting Obama dismissed or ignored flat Earth believers as unworthy of attention. Bottom panel shows casual photograph of three prominent science communicators at what appears to be social event or gathering. Left: Bill Nye (Science Guy) with reddish-brown hair and bow tie (signature look), broad smile showing teeth. Center: Barack Obama in lighter colored suit (gray or tan), white dress shirt, smiling warmly at camera showing characteristic wide grin. Right: Neil deGrasse Tyson (astrophysicist/science educator) with distinctive mustache, showing partial smile. All three men appear happy and friendly, captured in close selfie-style photograph suggesting camaraderie. Warm indoor lighting, yellowish/beige background. Text overlay at bottom in matching large bold white letters: "BUT HAS TIME FOR THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY" - mocking reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's scientific statement that Earth is slightly pear-shaped (oblate spheroid with Southern Hemisphere slightly wider than Northern). Lower right corner shows "Nick Havok" photographer credit. Meme employs hypocrisy accusation format suggesting: 1) Obama won't acknowledge flat Earth believers, 2) But associates with scientists (Nye/Tyson) who make "absurd" claims about pear-shaped Earth, 3) Implying mainstream scientists are equally ridiculous as flat Earthers but receive different treatment. Rhetorical strategy attempts to create false equivalency between scientifically accurate statement (Earth is oblate spheroid) and pseudoscience (flat Earth), suggesting both are equally "crazy" but one receives establishment endorsement while other is marginalized. Context: Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment refers to precise satellite measurements showing Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - Southern Hemisphere bulge ~20 meters wider than Northern Hemisphere bulge. This 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid is measured by GRACE satellites and is scientifically accurate, though term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle asymmetry imperceptible to naked eye. Obama has publicly praised science education and supported NASA, appearing with science communicators like Nye and Tyson to promote STEM education and climate change awareness. Bill Nye is mechanical engineer and science educator known for PBS show "Bill Nye the Science Guy" targeting children. Neil deGrasse Tyson is astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of "Cosmos" reboot. Both are prominent science advocates often targeted by conspiracy theorists for defending mainstream scientific consensus. Meme's humor (from flat Earth perspective) relies on: 1) Obama's dismissive hand gesture reused for opposite meaning, 2) Ironic juxtaposition of rejecting "obviously correct" flat Earth while accepting "absurd" pear Earth, 3) Suggestion that scientific establishment is hypocritical social club rather than evidence-based institution. However, fundamental difference: flat Earth contradicted by millennia of evidence, while Earth's oblate shape with asymmetric bulge is precisely measured fact confirmed by multiple independent observations.4:Tea5,ISS hoax meme claiming International Space Station footage filmed using green screen technology. Image shows astronaut in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuit against gradient background transitioning from white/light blue at top to darker blue-green at bottom. Astronaut positioned in three-quarter profile view showing right side of suit and helmet. White spacesuit highly detailed with realistic textures - fabric layers, mechanical joints, equipment pouches, hoses, connectors, straps visible across torso and arms. Large spherical helmet with clear polycarbonate visor shows astronaut's face - appears to be middle-aged person with serious expression looking off to side. Interior helmet lighting visible illuminating face. Gold-tinted sun visor in raised position above clear visor. Helmet attached to Hard Upper Torso (HUT) unit with metal neck ring connector. Right shoulder displays prominent American flag patch - rectangular flag with red, white, and blue stripes and stars. Chest area shows various equipment including caution/warning labels, attachment points for safety tethers. Left side shows NASA logo patch - classic blue circular "meatball" design with red chevron, white text, and orbital trajectory. Suit appears to be EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) used for spacewalks. Background intentionally simple gradient suggesting studio environment rather than space. Text overlay in large bold blue letters at top left: "NASA ISS HOAX AstroNOT" (deliberately misspelling astronaut as "astroNOT" to mock authenticity). Bottom text in blue: "#YearBehindGreenScreen" hashtag suggesting ongoing deception. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Lower right shows modified NASA logo - classic meatball design with red diagonal slash through it overlaid with word "LIARS" in blue/white gradient letters, explicitly accusing space agency of deception. Meme represents flat Earth belief that International Space Station is elaborate hoax, with "astronauts" actually performing in Earth-based studio using green screen technology to fake weightlessness and space environment. Claims suggest ISS livestreams showing Earth views, experiments, and crew activities are CGI composites or underwater filming with green screen backgrounds added in post-production. Argument points to occasional technical glitches in livestreams (bubbles, harness reflections, hair not floating properly) as "proof" of deception. However, extensive evidence confirms ISS reality: 1) Station visible to naked eye as bright moving point of light crossing sky in ~90-minute orbit, observable worldwide, 2) Amateur astronomers photograph ISS transiting sun/moon showing detailed station structure matching official images, 3) Radio operators communicate with ISS crew using ham radio, 4) Multiple nations operate on ISS (USA, Russia, EU, Japan, Canada) - Cold War adversaries would not collaborate on hoax, 5) Continuous crew rotation since 2000 involving 270+ astronauts from 20+ countries, 6) Scientific research conducted on station produces peer-reviewed results, 7) Supply missions from multiple commercial and governmental entities regularly dock with station (SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Russian Progress, Japanese HTV), 8) ISS cost over $150 billion to construct and operate - unsustainable for hoax. Green screen claims ignore that ISS footage shows consistent physics of microgravity: neutral buoyancy underwater training looks distinctly different from actual weightlessness (air bubbles rise, movements are slower/different, buoyancy compensators visible). Meme format designed to plant doubt about space exploration authenticity, targeting NASA specifically as primary US space agency responsible for ISS operations and public communications.5:T11ed,Spectacular ocean sunset photograph with flat Earth watermark suggesting flat horizon proves flat Earth. Breathtaking seascape showing sun touching horizon during golden hour sunset over ocean/sea. Sun appears as bright yellow-white orb positioned exactly at horizon line in center of frame creating dramatic focal point. Sky dominates upper two-thirds of image showing layered cloud formations in stunning gradient of warm colors. Directly above horizon, sky glows intense yellow-orange gradually transitioning upward through deeper orange, red-orange, amber, and dark orange-red tones. Upper sky transitions to darker tones - russet, brown, gray, purple-gray as altitude increases. Cloud layer consists of altocumulus or stratocumulus formations creating textured ceiling across entire frame. Clouds appear as individual puffy masses separated by darker gaps, creating mottled appearance with three-dimensional depth. Underside of clouds illuminated brilliant gold-orange by setting sun, while top edges appear darker creating chiaroscuro effect. Cloud bases create horizontal striations across sky. Light rays (crepuscular rays) visible as subtle radial patterns emanating from sun position, though somewhat obscured by clouds. Lower third shows ocean water surface appearing dark blue-black or deep purple-gray in contrast to bright sky. Water reflects setting sun creating vertical columnar reflection - bright yellow-orange streak extending from sun down to bottom frame edge. Reflection column shows rippled pattern from gentle wave action on water surface, creating broken sparkling effect rather than perfect mirror. Reflection demonstrates specular reflection on textured surface. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level stretching horizontally across frame dividing brilliant sky from dark water - this flat appearance of horizon is key visual element referenced by watermark. Water surface in foreground shows gentle rolling wave with white foam crest creating light colored line parallel to shore. Wave creates slight texture breaking up otherwise smooth water surface. Sandy beach or wet shoreline visible in immediate foreground bottom edge appearing as darkest element in frame. Lower left corner contains text overlay in light gray sans-serif font: "Flat Earth Matters" - flat Earth movement slogan/hashtag. Image represents common flat Earth visual argument: horizon appears perfectly flat and level from observer's ground-level vantage point, suggesting Earth's surface must be flat plane rather than curved sphere. However, this interpretation fundamentally misunderstands scale and perspective. Scientific explanation: From sea level, human observer can see to horizon approximately 3 miles away (distance depends on observer height - 6 feet tall person sees to 3 miles, standing on 10-foot platform extends to 3.9 miles). At these short distances on planet with 7,917-mile diameter, curvature is geometrically negligible - approximately 6 feet of drop over 3-mile distance. Human eye cannot resolve such subtle curvature, especially when viewing horizon as thin line between contrasting elements (bright sky, dark water). Horizon appearing flat at human scale says nothing about Earth's overall shape - same principle as tabletop appearing flat despite Earth's curvature, or calm lake appearing flat despite planet's sphericity. Earth's curvature becomes visible only from higher altitudes: commercial aircraft at 35,000-40,000 feet show subtle curvature when horizon spans wider field of view, while curvature becomes obvious from 100,000+ feet (high-altitude balloons, spacecraft). Bedford Level experiment demonstrated in 1838 that distant objects on long waterway appear to drop below line of sight consistent with Earth's curvature, contradicting flat Earth expectations. Columnar sun reflection on water occurs identically on spherical Earth as it would on flat plane - only requires locally smooth surface within visible range. Photograph's beauty makes it effective propaganda piece - emotionally compelling sunset scene attached to flat Earth message creates positive association, while horizon's apparent flatness serves as "evidence" requiring no technical knowledge to interpret. However, same image actually demonstrates atmospheric refraction (sun's oval shape, color changes from atmospheric scattering), sunset mechanics that work identically on spherical Earth, and horizon geometry consistent with large spherical planet viewed from ground level. Attribution should credit original photographer, though source unclear from watermark alone.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-335","title":"Other 335","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801147_468509303348809_6666016191156905904_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-334","title":"Other 334","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12800299_469766833223056_7573221995986332986_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-336","title":"Other 336","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801193_468490566684016_7036204766816387195_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
