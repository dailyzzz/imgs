5:Te8e,"Not bad" meme format mocking Barack Obama, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson using pear-shaped Earth reference. Two-panel vertical meme using popular Obama "not bad" reaction image format. Top panel shows President Barack Obama in dark suit with presidential seal visible on left edge, American flag in background. Obama holds left hand up in dismissive stopping gesture near face, expression showing skepticism or rejection. Gray/neutral background. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY" - suggesting Obama dismissed or ignored flat Earth believers as unworthy of attention. Bottom panel shows casual photograph of three prominent science communicators at what appears to be social event or gathering. Left: Bill Nye (Science Guy) with reddish-brown hair and bow tie (signature look), broad smile showing teeth. Center: Barack Obama in lighter colored suit (gray or tan), white dress shirt, smiling warmly at camera showing characteristic wide grin. Right: Neil deGrasse Tyson (astrophysicist/science educator) with distinctive mustache, showing partial smile. All three men appear happy and friendly, captured in close selfie-style photograph suggesting camaraderie. Warm indoor lighting, yellowish/beige background. Text overlay at bottom in matching large bold white letters: "BUT HAS TIME FOR THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY" - mocking reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's scientific statement that Earth is slightly pear-shaped (oblate spheroid with Southern Hemisphere slightly wider than Northern). Lower right corner shows "Nick Havok" photographer credit. Meme employs hypocrisy accusation format suggesting: 1) Obama won't acknowledge flat Earth believers, 2) But associates with scientists (Nye/Tyson) who make "absurd" claims about pear-shaped Earth, 3) Implying mainstream scientists are equally ridiculous as flat Earthers but receive different treatment. Rhetorical strategy attempts to create false equivalency between scientifically accurate statement (Earth is oblate spheroid) and pseudoscience (flat Earth), suggesting both are equally "crazy" but one receives establishment endorsement while other is marginalized. Context: Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment refers to precise satellite measurements showing Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - Southern Hemisphere bulge ~20 meters wider than Northern Hemisphere bulge. This 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid is measured by GRACE satellites and is scientifically accurate, though term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle asymmetry imperceptible to naked eye. Obama has publicly praised science education and supported NASA, appearing with science communicators like Nye and Tyson to promote STEM education and climate change awareness. Bill Nye is mechanical engineer and science educator known for PBS show "Bill Nye the Science Guy" targeting children. Neil deGrasse Tyson is astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of "Cosmos" reboot. Both are prominent science advocates often targeted by conspiracy theorists for defending mainstream scientific consensus. Meme's humor (from flat Earth perspective) relies on: 1) Obama's dismissive hand gesture reused for opposite meaning, 2) Ironic juxtaposition of rejecting "obviously correct" flat Earth while accepting "absurd" pear Earth, 3) Suggestion that scientific establishment is hypocritical social club rather than evidence-based institution. However, fundamental difference: flat Earth contradicted by millennia of evidence, while Earth's oblate shape with asymmetric bulge is precisely measured fact confirmed by multiple independent observations.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 335 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"\"Not bad\" meme format mocking Barack Obama, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson using pear-shaped Earth reference.
