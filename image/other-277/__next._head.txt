5:T84c,Morgan Freeman meme about circular reasoning and scientific authority. Popular internet meme format using actor Morgan Freeman to mock appeal to authority logical fallacy. Image shows Freeman wearing white suit jacket, white dress shirt, white tie against blurred gray-white background. He has gray hair and beard, warm friendly expression with slight smile. Both hands raised palms-up in explanatory gesture suggesting he's presenting obvious information. Background appears to be bright indoor setting possibly interview or photo shoot. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT'. Bottom text: 'PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING WHEN YOU CLAIM SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED IT'. Meme highlights circular reasoning and blind trust in scientific authority. Format plays on Freeman's authoritative voice and persona - frequently narrates documentaries giving him association with explaining facts. His calm presentation style makes absurd statements sound credible. In flat Earth context, meme criticizes mainstream acceptance of globe Earth based purely on trusting scientific consensus rather than personal investigation. Suggests people blindly believe scientific claims without examining evidence themselves. However, this creates ironic contradiction - meme itself asks people to distrust scientific method while trusting conspiracy theorists' alternative explanations. Scientific consensus on spherical Earth isn't blind faith - it's based on centuries of reproducible observations, measurements, calculations anyone can verify: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, seasons, Foucault pendulum, satellite communications requiring spherical trigonometry, circumnavigation, photographs from space. Science encourages skepticism and verification through repeatable experiments. Flat Earth claims often invoke authority of Bible, ancient texts, or charismatic YouTubers - different authority but still authority. Meme format became popular for satirizing various forms of circular reasoning and unquestioning belief0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 277 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Morgan Freeman meme about circular reasoning and scientific authority.
