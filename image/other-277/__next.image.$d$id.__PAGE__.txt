3:T84c,Morgan Freeman meme about circular reasoning and scientific authority. Popular internet meme format using actor Morgan Freeman to mock appeal to authority logical fallacy. Image shows Freeman wearing white suit jacket, white dress shirt, white tie against blurred gray-white background. He has gray hair and beard, warm friendly expression with slight smile. Both hands raised palms-up in explanatory gesture suggesting he's presenting obvious information. Background appears to be bright indoor setting possibly interview or photo shoot. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT'. Bottom text: 'PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING WHEN YOU CLAIM SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED IT'. Meme highlights circular reasoning and blind trust in scientific authority. Format plays on Freeman's authoritative voice and persona - frequently narrates documentaries giving him association with explaining facts. His calm presentation style makes absurd statements sound credible. In flat Earth context, meme criticizes mainstream acceptance of globe Earth based purely on trusting scientific consensus rather than personal investigation. Suggests people blindly believe scientific claims without examining evidence themselves. However, this creates ironic contradiction - meme itself asks people to distrust scientific method while trusting conspiracy theorists' alternative explanations. Scientific consensus on spherical Earth isn't blind faith - it's based on centuries of reproducible observations, measurements, calculations anyone can verify: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, seasons, Foucault pendulum, satellite communications requiring spherical trigonometry, circumnavigation, photographs from space. Science encourages skepticism and verification through repeatable experiments. Flat Earth claims often invoke authority of Bible, ancient texts, or charismatic YouTubers - different authority but still authority. Meme format became popular for satirizing various forms of circular reasoning and unquestioning belief4:T83f,Australian surfer riding gravitational wave meme playing on upside-down Australia trope. Meme combining gravitational wave physics concept with flat Earth southern hemisphere joke. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'AUSTRALIAN MAN SURFS'. Image shows spectacular action surfing photograph taken from above showing surfer carving turn on large ocean wave. Surfer wears red wetsuit or rashguard with white/tan surfboard visible beneath feet. Wave shows beautiful turquoise-blue water with white foam spray arcing dramatically from surfer's turn creating crescent-shaped curtain of water. Surrounding ocean displays deep blue color with rippled texture. Photograph captures dynamic moment mid-maneuver showing skill and power. Foam and spray create artistic patterns in water. Lighting suggests sunny conditions with clear visibility. Perspective from directly above or slightly elevated gives bird's-eye view of surfing action. Bottom text: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme works on multiple levels: 1) References 2016 gravitational waves detection making science news, 2) Plays on 'upside-down Australia' joke where people in southern hemisphere are allegedly upside down on globe Earth, 3) Visual pun where curved arc of water spray resembles wave/waveform in physics sense. Flat Earth context: In flat Earth model, 'down' is same direction everywhere (toward disc), so Australia isn't upside down. Globe skeptics mock idea that Australians stand upside down (misunderstanding of gravity - 'down' means toward Earth's center from any surface point). Gravitational waves reference adds physics joke since flat Earth community rejects Einstein's relativity and gravitational wave detection. Meme suggests Australian's orientation on globe requires gravitational waves to stay attached. However, gravity pulls toward planetary center regardless of surface location - no special force needed. On sphere, all surface dwellers experience 'down' as toward core. Australian surfer experiences same gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²) as surfer anywhere else5:T8a5,Ocean and sky photograph with quote about truth defending itself like a lion. Motivational image featuring serene seascape with inspirational quote. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THE TRUTH IS LIKE A LION; YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND IT.' Center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white semi-transparent text. Bottom text: 'LET IT LOOSE; IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF.' Background displays peaceful ocean scene with calm blue water in lower half showing gentle ripples and wave texture. Horizon line divides image horizontally. Upper half shows expansive blue sky with scattered white fluffy clouds - mixture of cumulus clouds in various sizes creating pleasant partly-cloudy conditions. Sky shows gradient from deeper blue at top to lighter blue-white near horizon. Lighting suggests midday with bright sunlight. Overall composition creates sense of openness, freedom, natural beauty. Quote often attributed to Saint Augustine of Hippo (though exact sourcing unclear) comparing truth to powerful lion that needs no protection or defense - truth will prevail through its inherent strength. Flat Earth community uses this quote to suggest their beliefs don't require defending with evidence or arguments because 'truth' will become self-evident once people investigate. Implies flat Earth theory so obviously correct it requires no support - people should simply observe reality directly. However, philosophy of truth is more nuanced. While some truths are self-evident, complex scientific truths about nature often require evidence, explanation, mathematical proof. Spherical Earth isn't immediately obvious from ground level - requires measurement, observation, calculation to understand. Historical progression from flat Earth belief to spherical understanding required evidence accumulation: watching ships disappear over horizon, measuring shadows at different latitudes (Eratosthenes 240 BC), observing lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, circumnavigation, seeing Earth from space. Truth often DOES require defense through evidence and logical argument, especially when countering intuitive but incorrect assumptions. Lion metaphor sounds inspiring but oversimplifies epistemology0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-277","title":"Other 277","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12728913_463456750520731_470438632903024065_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-276","title":"Other 276","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717831_463501427182930_424940914684462304_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-278","title":"Other 278","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12728929_463100173889722_4581883976976956813_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
