5:T51b,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning ship disappearing perspective. Shows Keanu Reeves as character from film with long dark brown messy hair, wearing white loose-fitting garment or shirt. Has confused, contemplative facial expression - mouth slightly open, eyes wide with puzzled look, eyebrows raised. Background blurred showing neutral beige-tan colors suggesting indoor setting. Top text in large white bold Impact font with black outline: 'WHAT IF SHIPS SAILING OVER THE HORIZON'. Bottom right corner shows small 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text: 'IS REALLY JUST PERSPECTIVE?' Uses Conspiracy Keanu meme format (originated 2011) depicting sudden realization or mind-blown conspiracy theory moment. Questions mainstream explanation that ships disappear hull-first over horizon due to Earth's curvature. Suggests alternative explanation: ships appear to sink due to perspective convergence and atmospheric effects rather than physical curve. Flat Earth argument claims with powerful zoom equipment (like Nikon P900 camera), ships can be brought back into view even after appearing to go over horizon, suggesting they never went behind curve but just became too small for naked eye to see. Challenges one of oldest and most cited proofs of spherical Earth dating back to ancient Greek observations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 219 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning ship disappearing perspective.
