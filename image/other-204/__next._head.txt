5:T69d,Detailed Rosetta mission infographic showing 4-billion-mile space race to comet 67P. Black space background with colorful diagrams, text boxes, and illustrations. Large white bold title at top: 'THE 4BILLION-MILE SPACE RACE'. Left side shows mission timeline with numbered stages: '1) Mar 2004 Launched aboard Ariane 5 from French Guiana', '2) Mar 2007 Accelerated using Mars's gravity to pick up speed', '3) Aug 6, 2014 Rendezvous attempt with Comet 67P 400million-mile journey', '4) TODAY Philae landing craft will be sent to surface of comet, 315million miles from earth'. Trajectory diagram shows red orbital paths from Earth (small blue sphere) through Mars (small red sphere) around yellow Sun, with dotted yellow lines indicating spacecraft path to comet orbit. Upper right shows detailed Rosetta spacecraft illustration with large blue-tinted solar panels and gold body. Yellow info box lists: 'ROSETTA FACTFILE Size: 10ft x 6ft x 6ft, Wingspan: 105ft, Weight: 3.3 tons, Speed: 23.4 miles/sec (84,000mph), Payload: Philae lander and a nickel disk micro-engraved with first three chapters of Genesis, microscopically engraved in 1,000 languages'. Center-bottom shows 'PHILAE LANDER FACTFILE' with yellow text listing specifications. Lower section displays gray irregular potato-shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with labeled features including 'Back-up landing site', 'Agilkia landing site', '19300ft' distance marker, and 'London to scale' size comparison. Right side shows 'COMET FACTFILE' with red/yellow text boxes listing comet properties. MailOnline credit at bottom.
