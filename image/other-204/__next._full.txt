13:T69d,Detailed Rosetta mission infographic showing 4-billion-mile space race to comet 67P. Black space background with colorful diagrams, text boxes, and illustrations. Large white bold title at top: 'THE 4BILLION-MILE SPACE RACE'. Left side shows mission timeline with numbered stages: '1) Mar 2004 Launched aboard Ariane 5 from French Guiana', '2) Mar 2007 Accelerated using Mars's gravity to pick up speed', '3) Aug 6, 2014 Rendezvous attempt with Comet 67P 400million-mile journey', '4) TODAY Philae landing craft will be sent to surface of comet, 315million miles from earth'. Trajectory diagram shows red orbital paths from Earth (small blue sphere) through Mars (small red sphere) around yellow Sun, with dotted yellow lines indicating spacecraft path to comet orbit. Upper right shows detailed Rosetta spacecraft illustration with large blue-tinted solar panels and gold body. Yellow info box lists: 'ROSETTA FACTFILE Size: 10ft x 6ft x 6ft, Wingspan: 105ft, Weight: 3.3 tons, Speed: 23.4 miles/sec (84,000mph), Payload: Philae lander and a nickel disk micro-engraved with first three chapters of Genesis, microscopically engraved in 1,000 languages'. Center-bottom shows 'PHILAE LANDER FACTFILE' with yellow text listing specifications. Lower section displays gray irregular potato-shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with labeled features including 'Back-up landing site', 'Agilkia landing site', '19300ft' distance marker, and 'London to scale' size comparison. Right side shows 'COMET FACTFILE' with red/yellow text boxes listing comet properties. MailOnline credit at bottom. Historic space mission demonstrating orbital mechanics, gravity assists, and first controlled comet landing14:T723,Historical scientific text excerpt discussing alternative gravity theory and curved space. Shows dense paragraph of black text on white/cream background, appears to be from older printed book or journal. Text discusses author's discoveries related to force and motion of celestial bodies. Opening line: 'During the succeeding two years of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far-reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon.' Explains theory of force causing motion of heavenly bodies under its influence. References 'kinetic idea' and 'curved space' concepts similar to relativistic theory. Describes gravitational equivalence or resemblance to reality with 'self-contradictory' aspects. Discusses how 'curved spaces must react on the bodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves.' Mentions action and reaction becoming eccentric, questioning if proposed solution is impossible. States 'Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed. Only this can explain the working of the universe without recognizing the existence of any other unexplainable function or plays in the phenomena.' Second paragraph discusses 'physical truth of the greatest importance' - 'there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.' References birthday on July 10. Mentions applying concepts 'rigorously to molecules and atoms' as well as 'largest heavenly bodies'. Discusses energy in matter drawn from environment. References radioactivity discovery in 1896 and search for external agent. Historical alternative physics theory challenging mainstream gravitational concepts, possibly pre-Einstein or alternative to general relativity15:T573,The Truman Show scene with quote about accepting presented reality. Shows close-up of older man wearing round wire-frame glasses and beige/tan fedora or similar hat. Has weathered face with wrinkles, light blue-gray eyes gazing directly at camera with knowing, slightly mysterious expression. Dark blurred background with warm orange/amber light source visible left side. Top left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray text. Bottom shows white subtitle text: 'We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.' Quote from The Truman Show (1998) film spoken by Christof (Ed Harris), the creator/director who controls Truman's artificial world. In context, line explains why Truman never questioned his reality despite living in elaborate TV show set. Flat Earth community uses quote to argue that people accept globe Earth model without questioning because it's what authority figures present from childhood. Suggests mainstream worldview is constructed artificial reality maintained by social conditioning and media control. Implies those who question official narratives are like Truman discovering the truth beyond the dome. Film's themes of manufactured reality, omnipresent surveillance, and breaking free from illusion resonate with conspiracy theory communities. Image suggests audience is living in controlled simulation where true nature of world is hidden9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-204","title":"Other 204","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12615687_455841437948929_6201641613403958283_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-203","title":"Other 203","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12615490_458894797643593_32218597814754500_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-205","title":"Other 205","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12621963_456552457877827_1305103088350585650_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
