5:T847,Dog nose versus black holes comparison mocking LIGO gravitational wave detection. Satirical image comparing LIGO's gravitational wave detection visualization to dog nose photograph. Image split into three sections. Top section shows close-up photograph of dog's nose in black and white - two nostrils appear as dark holes separated by median groove, textured wet skin around nostrils with visible pores and bumpy surface typical of canine rhinarium. Top text in white typewriter-style font: '2 Black holes...??? Or Dog nose...!!!' with multiple question marks and exclamation points suggesting skepticism. Middle section shows quote in white text: '"By the way, this is not a Hollywood production that I am going to show you..."' appears to be quote from scientist discussing LIGO detection. Text suggests speaker emphasizing authenticity of upcoming image. News ticker visible showing 'Sky NEWS' logo, time stamp 'LIVE 10:37', stock price '5590.36'. Bottom section displays LIGO's famous gravitational wave visualization - computer-generated image showing two dark circular regions (black holes) creating warped spacetime effect on dark gray/brown granular background resembling gravel or cosmic dust. Visualization shows merger of two black holes with distortion patterns radiating outward. Large white text overlaid: 'NASA LIES'. Below: 'Research your Flat and Stationary Earth'. Bottom news banner: 'SPACE BREAKTHROUGH' with red background, white text explaining 'THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WAS FIRST PREDICTED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN A CENTURY' and additional scrolling text about Jeremy Corbyn and junior doctors. Attribution: 'Karlee Sunshine Midreno'. Meme mocks resemblance between dog nose and LIGO visualization suggesting detection image is fake or dog nose. However, similarity is superficial - LIGO image shows computer simulation of spacetime curvature from actual interferometer data detecting ripples from black hole merger 1.3 billion light-years away. Detection confirmed Einstein's century-old prediction, won Nobel Prize. Visual similarity to dog nose doesn't invalidate scientific measurement0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 284 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dog nose versus black holes comparison mocking LIGO gravitational wave detection.
