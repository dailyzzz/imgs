13:T847,Dog nose versus black holes comparison mocking LIGO gravitational wave detection. Satirical image comparing LIGO's gravitational wave detection visualization to dog nose photograph. Image split into three sections. Top section shows close-up photograph of dog's nose in black and white - two nostrils appear as dark holes separated by median groove, textured wet skin around nostrils with visible pores and bumpy surface typical of canine rhinarium. Top text in white typewriter-style font: '2 Black holes...??? Or Dog nose...!!!' with multiple question marks and exclamation points suggesting skepticism. Middle section shows quote in white text: '"By the way, this is not a Hollywood production that I am going to show you..."' appears to be quote from scientist discussing LIGO detection. Text suggests speaker emphasizing authenticity of upcoming image. News ticker visible showing 'Sky NEWS' logo, time stamp 'LIVE 10:37', stock price '5590.36'. Bottom section displays LIGO's famous gravitational wave visualization - computer-generated image showing two dark circular regions (black holes) creating warped spacetime effect on dark gray/brown granular background resembling gravel or cosmic dust. Visualization shows merger of two black holes with distortion patterns radiating outward. Large white text overlaid: 'NASA LIES'. Below: 'Research your Flat and Stationary Earth'. Bottom news banner: 'SPACE BREAKTHROUGH' with red background, white text explaining 'THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WAS FIRST PREDICTED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN A CENTURY' and additional scrolling text about Jeremy Corbyn and junior doctors. Attribution: 'Karlee Sunshine Midreno'. Meme mocks resemblance between dog nose and LIGO visualization suggesting detection image is fake or dog nose. However, similarity is superficial - LIGO image shows computer simulation of spacetime curvature from actual interferometer data detecting ripples from black hole merger 1.3 billion light-years away. Detection confirmed Einstein's century-old prediction, won Nobel Prize. Visual similarity to dog nose doesn't invalidate scientific measurement14:T79d,Flat Earth cosmology sun diagram with colored orbital circles. Minimalist educational diagram showing sun in flat Earth model with symbolic colored circles. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Central illustration on solid black background shows large pale yellow-cream circle representing sun in center. Sun rendered as perfect sphere with subtle gradient from bright yellow-white at center to slightly darker cream at edges suggesting luminosity. Around central sun positioned six smaller solid-colored circles arranged roughly in circular pattern but not perfectly symmetrical: Upper center shows deep blue/navy circle. Upper left shows teal/cyan circle. Left side shows forest green circle. Lower center shows bright yellow circle (slightly smaller than sun but similar color). Right side shows orange-amber circle. Upper right shows dark red/maroon circle. Circles appear to float in space around sun on black background. No connecting lines, orbits, labels, or explanatory text visible besides title. Spacing between circles irregular - not precise orbital diagram. Bottom text on beige border: 'THE SUN'. Minimalist aesthetic with vintage poster feel from beige border and simple color palette. Diagram purpose unclear without labels - colored circles might represent: 1) Planets in flat Earth model orbiting sun (though flat Earth models typically have sun orbiting above Earth plane, not other planets orbiting sun), 2) Different wavelengths/colors of light emitted by sun (but why only 6 discrete colors?), 3) Symbolic representation of sun's influence or energy at different positions, 4) Purely decorative artistic interpretation. Standard flat Earth cosmology has small local sun (32-50 miles diameter, 3000-5000 miles altitude) circling above stationary Earth plane creating day/night through proximity/distance. This diagram's meaning ambiguous without context. Artistic style mimics vintage scientific illustrations15:T851,DIY Hubble Space Telescope satirical assembly instructions meme. Humorous infographic mocking Hubble Space Telescope construction with everyday household items. Top banner in bright cyan blue with yellow handwritten-style text 'DO IT YOURSELF' and large white bold text 'HUBBLE TELESCOPE!' Below shows six panels with white backgrounds separated by black borders, each containing simple 3D rendered illustration of common object with label underneath. Panel 1: Washing machine drum - metallic cylindrical drum with perforated holes, labeled '1. Washing Machine Drum'. Panel 2: Aluminum foil - roll of shiny silver foil partially unrolled, labeled '2. Aluminum Foil'. Panel 3: Toilet seat lid - white oval plastic toilet seat cover, labeled '3. Toilet Seat Lid'. Panel 4: TV dish antenna - gray satellite dish on stand, labeled '4. T.V. Dish Antenna'. Panel 5: Curved lens - gray convex optical lens shown in profile, labeled '5. Curved Lens'. Panel 6: Solar panels - black rectangular photovoltaic panel array, labeled '6. Solar Panels'. Lower portion shows black background with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white at upper right. Center displays photograph of actual Hubble Space Telescope in orbit - cylindrical spacecraft with distinctive solar panel wings, metallic gold-brown thermal insulation wrapping, various instruments and antennae protruding. Large white handwritten text 'Voila!' suggests final assembled product. Bottom shows red banner 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical meme suggests Hubble telescope crudely assembled from cheap household items rather than sophisticated optical instrument. Implies space telescope imagery is fake, produced by low-budget contraption. However, Hubble launched 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery, built over decade by thousands of engineers at cost of $4.7 billion (inflation-adjusted ~$10B today). Contains 2.4-meter precision mirror, advanced spectrographs, infrared/ultraviolet cameras, operates in low Earth orbit at 547 km altitude. Has captured over 1.5 million observations transforming astronomy. Meme dismisses extraordinary engineering achievement as fraudulent apparatus9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-284","title":"Other 284","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12733513_463978993801840_1494230350043442241_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-283","title":"Other 283","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729356_464902073709532_6940837958255985229_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-285","title":"Other 285","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734022_464930290373377_7244195183032635053_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
