Top text: 'Speed of light: 299,792,458 m/s' followed by 'Coordinates of the Great Pyramid of Giza: 29.9792458°N' and bottom text 'COINCIDENCE?' in large outlined letters. Claims pyramid's latitude coordinate (29.9792458°N) matches first 8 digits of speed of light in meters per second (299,792,458), suggesting ancient Egyptians encoded advanced physics knowledge or universal constants into pyramid's location. Implies impossible ancient knowledge or deliberate placement by advanced civilization, though coordinate precision depends on reference system and measurement conventions developed millennia after pyramid construction."},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-5","title":"Pseudo Science 5","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/18194629_809120345907850_3756422759914770187_n.jpeg","description":"Three-panel satirical meme about gender identity and science. Top left shows woman at microphone/podium with speech bubble 'I'm a GIRL!' Top right shows Bill Nye the Science Guy in bow tie with speech bubble 'I'm a Scientist!' Bottom panel shows rusted deteriorated vintage car (appears to be 1970s sedan) with wood paneling missing, rust, damage, on brick patio, with speech bubble 'And I'M a Lamborghini!' Bottom text: 'Come on people!!! You HAVE to call Bullshit at some point!' Uses absurdist comparison: if someone can identify as different gender, by same logic rusted old car could identify as luxury Lamborghini. Satirical critique of gender identity concepts by comparing to obviously false material claim, arguing there must be objective limits to self-identification that contradict physical reality."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-7","title":"Pseudo Science 7","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/18920275_1575680715788848_6214679928063501643_n.jpeg","description":"Conspiracy meme titled 'FREEMASON SCIENCE' showing image of Earth partially submerged in red water/ocean against dark red sky. Lists three statistics all containing number 666: 'Earth revolves around the sun at: 66,600 mph' (in large yellow numbers), 'Curvature of one square mile: 666 ft' (in yellow), 'Earth tilts at: 66.6°' (in yellow), followed by bottom text 'STILL THINK IT'S ALL A COINCIDENCE?' Claims recurring 666 (biblical 'number of the beast') in Earth's physical parameters is intentional Masonic/occult symbolism embedded in heliocentric model, suggesting scientific establishment deliberately fabricated measurements with satanic numerology. Implies heliocentric model is Masonic conspiracy rather than empirical astronomy, though actual values differ from those cited."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
