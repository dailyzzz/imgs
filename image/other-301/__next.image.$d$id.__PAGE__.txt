3:T96c,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning satellite visibility in ISS footage. Two-panel meme using popular "Conspiracy Keanu" format to question satellite existence. Top section displays computer-generated visualization of satellites orbiting Earth viewed from space. Central Earth appears as blue-green sphere with white cloud patterns showing realistic continental outlines. Surrounding Earth in dense orbital shell are hundreds/thousands of small white dots/objects representing satellites in various orbital planes creating spherical envelope around planet. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Dots concentrated in bands suggesting different orbital altitudes - some closer to surface (Low Earth Orbit), others further out (Medium/Geostationary orbits). Visualization dramatically depicts space debris/satellite population problem. Text overlay in white sans-serif font top center: 'EVERY SINGLE SATELLITE ORBITING THE EARTH'. Below in center: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom section shows Keanu Reeves in his famous "conspiracy Keanu" pose from scene looking upward with suspicious/confused expression. He has dark wavy/messy hair, wears light colored shirt/jacket, background shows blurred warm-toned outdoor setting. Top text continues: 'IF THERE ARE REALLY THAT MANY SATELLITES,'. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THEN WHY DON'T WE SEE THEM IN ANY OF THE ISS VIDEOS?' Meme questions why thousands of satellites aren't visible in International Space Station footage if so many orbit Earth. However, several factors explain this: 1) Most satellites are small (size of refrigerator to bus), 2) Space is vast - even thousands of satellites spread across orbital shells spanning 200-36,000 km altitude means huge distances between objects, 3) Satellites move at different speeds in different orbits making simultaneous viewing unlikely, 4) ISS cameras typically point at Earth or into deep space, not lateral orbital plane where most satellites cluster, 5) Many satellites visible in long-exposure ISS photos as streaks, 6) ISS astronauts DO occasionally photograph satellites (Hubble servicing missions, visiting spacecraft, passing satellites documented). Visualization exaggerates visual density - satellites aren't clustered that tightly from any single vantage point. Similar to how stars exist but we don't see thousands simultaneously from ground level during day4:T85f,Rambo giving thumbs up covered in blood after researching flat Earth all night. Humorous meme using Sylvester Stallone's Rambo character to depict exhaustion after conspiracy research. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING FLAT EARTH ALL NIGHT'. Image shows action movie still from Rambo film series. Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo appears battle-worn and bloodied but defiant. He's soaking wet with water dripping from face and body, dark hair plastered to head. Face and body covered in mud, dirt, blood, scratches showing intense combat. Wears dark olive/gray tactical shirt or vest, visible muscular arms with dirt and abrasions. Despite injuries, Rambo gives enthusiastic double thumbs-up gesture with both hands raised - exaggerated positive response suggesting satisfaction despite physical toll. Facial expression shows gritted teeth, intense eyes, strained smile - combination of pain and triumph. Background blurred showing green foliage suggesting jungle or wilderness setting typical of Rambo films. Upper right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'AND SOMEONE ASKS IF YOU'RE OK'. Meme compares deep-dive flat Earth research session to intense physical battle - emerging bloodied, exhausted, traumatized but claiming to be fine. Thumbs-up despite obvious distress represents flat Earther's enthusiasm about 'discoveries' even when mentally drained from hours consuming conspiracy content. Humor comes from absurd juxtaposition of Rambo's extreme combat injuries with simple question about wellbeing, and from relating intense action movie imagery to sitting at computer watching YouTube videos. Reflects experience of falling into conspiracy rabbit hole - staying up all night watching videos, reading forums, losing sleep, becoming increasingly agitated/paranoid, then insisting everything's great when concerned friends/family check in. Format resonates because conspiracy research can indeed be mentally/emotionally draining, though comparing it to Rambo's literal warfare is obviously hyperbolic comedic exaggeration5:T883,Astronaut spacewalk with 'It's all FAKE' sign composite. Manipulated photograph showing astronaut during EVA holding sign claiming space activities are fabricated. Image shows astronaut in full white Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit performing spacewalk outside spacecraft. Astronaut's gold-tinted reflective helmet visor visible showing reflection of another astronaut/photographer and spacecraft components. White spacesuit shows various equipment: chest-mounted control panel with switches/displays, safety tethers, communication equipment, American flag patch visible. Astronaut's gloved hands hold white rectangular sign/card with handwritten text in black marker: 'It's all FAKE' in casual script lettering. Background shows Earth's curved surface below with brilliant white cloud formations against deep blue ocean, confirming high-altitude orbital perspective. Portions of spacecraft visible - white/silver metallic structures, cylindrical modules, solar panel edges with characteristic dark photovoltaic cells and gray structural supports. Earth's atmosphere visible as thin blue line along horizon. Deep black space beyond. Scene appears to be genuine ISS exterior activity photograph digitally altered to add sign. Meme suggests space program is hoax with astronaut ironically holding admission of fakery during supposedly fake spacewalk. However, image itself demonstrates why this is paradoxical - shows actual spacewalk photography with real orbital mechanics, Earth curvature, spacecraft hardware, proper lighting/shadows, atmospheric perspective. Hundreds of hours of EVA footage exist from multiple space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, CNSA) spanning decades with thousands of witnesses, live broadcasts, consistent physics. Sign is obvious digital insertion - astronauts don't carry props during dangerous technical spacewalks requiring both hands for safety and equipment operation. Real EVAs meticulously planned, every action choreographed. Carrying joke signs would violate safety protocols and mission objectives. Image is parody/satire possibly created by flat Earth skeptics mocking conspiracy theories, or by believers attempting dark humor0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-301","title":"Other 301","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745516_464362237096849_1873592563778867138_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-300","title":"Other 300","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744541_465992210267185_6200758682558836362_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-302","title":"Other 302","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745535_466625366870536_8988562656268671281_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
