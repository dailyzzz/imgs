5:T96c,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning satellite visibility in ISS footage. Two-panel meme using popular "Conspiracy Keanu" format to question satellite existence. Top section displays computer-generated visualization of satellites orbiting Earth viewed from space. Central Earth appears as blue-green sphere with white cloud patterns showing realistic continental outlines. Surrounding Earth in dense orbital shell are hundreds/thousands of small white dots/objects representing satellites in various orbital planes creating spherical envelope around planet. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Dots concentrated in bands suggesting different orbital altitudes - some closer to surface (Low Earth Orbit), others further out (Medium/Geostationary orbits). Visualization dramatically depicts space debris/satellite population problem. Text overlay in white sans-serif font top center: 'EVERY SINGLE SATELLITE ORBITING THE EARTH'. Below in center: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom section shows Keanu Reeves in his famous "conspiracy Keanu" pose from scene looking upward with suspicious/confused expression. He has dark wavy/messy hair, wears light colored shirt/jacket, background shows blurred warm-toned outdoor setting. Top text continues: 'IF THERE ARE REALLY THAT MANY SATELLITES,'. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THEN WHY DON'T WE SEE THEM IN ANY OF THE ISS VIDEOS?' Meme questions why thousands of satellites aren't visible in International Space Station footage if so many orbit Earth. However, several factors explain this: 1) Most satellites are small (size of refrigerator to bus), 2) Space is vast - even thousands of satellites spread across orbital shells spanning 200-36,000 km altitude means huge distances between objects, 3) Satellites move at different speeds in different orbits making simultaneous viewing unlikely, 4) ISS cameras typically point at Earth or into deep space, not lateral orbital plane where most satellites cluster, 5) Many satellites visible in long-exposure ISS photos as streaks, 6) ISS astronauts DO occasionally photograph satellites (Hubble servicing missions, visiting spacecraft, passing satellites documented). Visualization exaggerates visual density - satellites aren't clustered that tightly from any single vantage point. Similar to how stars exist but we don't see thousands simultaneously from ground level during day0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 301 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning satellite visibility in ISS footage.
