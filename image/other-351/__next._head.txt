5:T1371,Spacewalk comparison meme suggesting space EVAs filmed underwater in training facilities. Two-panel comparison image implying astronaut spacewalks are faked using underwater neutral buoyancy training facilities with backgrounds digitally replaced. Format suggests NASA uses underwater footage while claiming it's space. Top panel shows two astronauts in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuits performing underwater training exercise in Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) or similar facility. Scene unmistakably underwater - blue-tinted water surrounds astronauts creating characteristic aquatic environment. Left astronaut appears in full white spacesuit with helmet, working on equipment/mockup below. Right astronaut similarly suited, body oriented differently suggesting three-dimensional movement. Both suits show realistic NASA EVA suit details - white fabric covering, mechanical joints, equipment attachments, helmet visors. Water creates distinctive visual effects: blue color cast throughout scene, slight haziness from particulates in water, different lighting characteristics than vacuum of space. Background shows training facility infrastructure - appears to be walls, equipment, possibly safety divers barely visible in blue water. Scene clearly identifiable as underwater training environment used by NASA, ESA, Russian space program for EVA preparation. Astronauts practice spacewalk procedures in neutral buoyancy pool where water's buoyancy approximately simulates weightlessness, allowing realistic training for space operations. Center shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Bottom panel shows seemingly identical or very similar spacewalk scene but with dramatically different background. Same two astronauts in white spacesuits in essentially same positions/poses working on same equipment, but instead of blue water surrounding them, background now shows black void of space with Earth visible below - vibrant blue oceans, white clouds, curved horizon characteristic of orbital photography. Atmospheric glow visible at Earth's limb. Background appears as genuine space environment from low Earth orbit (ISS altitude ~250 miles). Equipment/hardware astronauts work on appears identical in both panels. Meme's implication: Top image is what actually happens - astronauts underwater in pool. Bottom image is what NASA shows public - same footage with background digitally replaced to simulate space. Suggests spacewalk broadcasts and photographs are composited fakes using underwater training footage with CGI Earth background added in post-production. Conspiracy theory claims astronauts never leave Earth; all "space" activities filmed in studios, underwater, or on aircraft, then backgrounds digitally manipulated. However, meme likely uses actual training footage (top) compared with actual space footage (bottom) to create false equivalency. NASA openly documents NBL training - not secret. Astronauts spend hundreds of hours in 40-foot-deep, 6.2-million-gallon pool practicing specific EVA tasks on full-scale ISS mockups before actual spacewalks. Training footage is publicly available, educational, and clearly identified as training. Differences between underwater training and actual spacewalk are obvious to careful observer: 1) Water creates blue tint, haze, bubbles (visible as astronauts move) - absent in space, 2) Underwater, astronauts' suits are weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy; in space, no weight needed, 3) Safety divers accompany underwater training - absent in space, 4) Underwater movement shows fluid dynamics; space movement shows pure momentum, 5) Equipment in water shows buoyancy effects; in space shows weightlessness. Space footage characteristics impossible to fake with underwater footage: 1) Perfect clarity without haze, 2) Absolute black sky, 3) Bright unfiltered sunlight creating harsh shadows, 4) Earth background showing correct orbital mechanics (moves across frame as ISS orbits), 5) Microgravity physics distinctly different from neutral buoyancy. Extensive evidence confirms real spacewalks occur: 1) ISS visible to naked eye from ground - can watch astronauts exit station through telescope, 2) Amateur radio operators track EVA communications, 3) Multiple nations conduct EVAs (USA, Russia, China, ESA) - competing nations wouldn't collaborate on hoax, 4) Decades of spacewalks with consistent physics, 5) Repairs and construction on ISS documented through multiple missions over 20+ years, 6) Astronauts from many countries participate including former Cold War adversaries. If using underwater footage, impossible to fake: consistent Earth rotation in background, orbital sunrise/sunset timing, stars positions matching time/date, hardware degradation over years from space radiation visible in photos. Meme's power comes from visual similarity - same suits, same positions - allowing false equivalency. Requires no technical knowledge to seem convincing to conspiracy-minded viewers.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 351 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Spacewalk comparison meme suggesting space EVAs filmed underwater in training facilities.
