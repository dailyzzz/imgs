3:T1371,Spacewalk comparison meme suggesting space EVAs filmed underwater in training facilities. Two-panel comparison image implying astronaut spacewalks are faked using underwater neutral buoyancy training facilities with backgrounds digitally replaced. Format suggests NASA uses underwater footage while claiming it's space. Top panel shows two astronauts in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuits performing underwater training exercise in Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) or similar facility. Scene unmistakably underwater - blue-tinted water surrounds astronauts creating characteristic aquatic environment. Left astronaut appears in full white spacesuit with helmet, working on equipment/mockup below. Right astronaut similarly suited, body oriented differently suggesting three-dimensional movement. Both suits show realistic NASA EVA suit details - white fabric covering, mechanical joints, equipment attachments, helmet visors. Water creates distinctive visual effects: blue color cast throughout scene, slight haziness from particulates in water, different lighting characteristics than vacuum of space. Background shows training facility infrastructure - appears to be walls, equipment, possibly safety divers barely visible in blue water. Scene clearly identifiable as underwater training environment used by NASA, ESA, Russian space program for EVA preparation. Astronauts practice spacewalk procedures in neutral buoyancy pool where water's buoyancy approximately simulates weightlessness, allowing realistic training for space operations. Center shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Bottom panel shows seemingly identical or very similar spacewalk scene but with dramatically different background. Same two astronauts in white spacesuits in essentially same positions/poses working on same equipment, but instead of blue water surrounding them, background now shows black void of space with Earth visible below - vibrant blue oceans, white clouds, curved horizon characteristic of orbital photography. Atmospheric glow visible at Earth's limb. Background appears as genuine space environment from low Earth orbit (ISS altitude ~250 miles). Equipment/hardware astronauts work on appears identical in both panels. Meme's implication: Top image is what actually happens - astronauts underwater in pool. Bottom image is what NASA shows public - same footage with background digitally replaced to simulate space. Suggests spacewalk broadcasts and photographs are composited fakes using underwater training footage with CGI Earth background added in post-production. Conspiracy theory claims astronauts never leave Earth; all "space" activities filmed in studios, underwater, or on aircraft, then backgrounds digitally manipulated. However, meme likely uses actual training footage (top) compared with actual space footage (bottom) to create false equivalency. NASA openly documents NBL training - not secret. Astronauts spend hundreds of hours in 40-foot-deep, 6.2-million-gallon pool practicing specific EVA tasks on full-scale ISS mockups before actual spacewalks. Training footage is publicly available, educational, and clearly identified as training. Differences between underwater training and actual spacewalk are obvious to careful observer: 1) Water creates blue tint, haze, bubbles (visible as astronauts move) - absent in space, 2) Underwater, astronauts' suits are weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy; in space, no weight needed, 3) Safety divers accompany underwater training - absent in space, 4) Underwater movement shows fluid dynamics; space movement shows pure momentum, 5) Equipment in water shows buoyancy effects; in space shows weightlessness. Space footage characteristics impossible to fake with underwater footage: 1) Perfect clarity without haze, 2) Absolute black sky, 3) Bright unfiltered sunlight creating harsh shadows, 4) Earth background showing correct orbital mechanics (moves across frame as ISS orbits), 5) Microgravity physics distinctly different from neutral buoyancy. Extensive evidence confirms real spacewalks occur: 1) ISS visible to naked eye from ground - can watch astronauts exit station through telescope, 2) Amateur radio operators track EVA communications, 3) Multiple nations conduct EVAs (USA, Russia, China, ESA) - competing nations wouldn't collaborate on hoax, 4) Decades of spacewalks with consistent physics, 5) Repairs and construction on ISS documented through multiple missions over 20+ years, 6) Astronauts from many countries participate including former Cold War adversaries. If using underwater footage, impossible to fake: consistent Earth rotation in background, orbital sunrise/sunset timing, stars positions matching time/date, hardware degradation over years from space radiation visible in photos. Meme's power comes from visual similarity - same suits, same positions - allowing false equivalency. Requires no technical knowledge to seem convincing to conspiracy-minded viewers.4:T156e,Burj Khalifa curvature comparison meme questioning visibility of Earth's curve at 2,722 feet altitude. Three-panel infographic arguing Earth's curvature should be visible from Burj Khalifa if MythBusters' claims about curvature visibility are accurate. Layout presents evidence comparison suggesting contradiction. Top section split into two side-by-side panels showing airplane window views from high altitude. Left panel: photograph through aircraft window showing airplane wing in lower right corner, horizon line cutting across center, curved Earth horizon visible with thin blue atmospheric band separating Earth's surface from black space above. Overlay text "@67,400 FT" indicates altitude. Right panel: similar airplane window photograph showing wing, horizon with visible curvature, atmospheric glow. Overlay text "@70,000 FT" indicates altitude. Both images show characteristic high-altitude views - dark sky above transitioning through atmospheric gradient to Earth surface below. Curvature appears as gentle arc across horizon. Middle section shows text on light blue background in dark gray/black font: "According to Mythbusters, we should be able to see a curve going up a mere 2500 feet." Word "2500 feet" appears in red for emphasis. Statement references MythBusters TV show episode examining Earth curvature visibility. Bottom section shows large aerial photograph taken from extreme height looking down at urban/suburban landscape. Image displays bird's-eye view of developed area with buildings, roads, infrastructure creating geometric patterns. Straight red line drawn horizontally across image at midpoint representing horizon line or reference level. Perspective shows landscape extending to horizon in all directions. Text overlay at bottom in white letters: "This photo is from the top of the Burj Khalifa." Second line: "It measures 2722 feet high." emphasizing altitude. Number "2722" appears in red matching emphasis color. Third line poses rhetorical question: "Where's the curvature?" - suggesting curvature should be visible but isn't. Lower left shows "fb.com/oierreeplana" attribution. Burj Khalifa in Dubai is world's tallest building at 2,722 feet (829.8 meters) to architectural top. Meme's argument: MythBusters claimed curvature visible at 2,500 feet altitude, Burj Khalifa exceeds that at 2,722 feet, yet photograph from top shows flat horizon, therefore either MythBusters wrong or Earth is flat. However, argument contains fundamental misunderstanding of scale and geometry. Scientific reality: Earth's curvature at 2,500-2,700 feet altitude is geometrically minuscule - horizon drops approximately 0.5 degrees over visible distance. At this altitude, observer's horizon extends roughly 64 miles, and Earth's curvature over that distance creates drop of approximately 2,700 feet (equal to observer altitude) - but this is spread across 64-mile circle, creating extremely gentle arc imperceptible to human eye as distinct curve. Visible "horizon line" appears straight because field of view captures small arc segment. MythBusters episode (if accurately referenced) likely discussed curvature becoming theoretically measurable at certain altitudes with precise instruments, not necessarily visible to naked eye as obvious curve. Human eye perception of curvature requires either: 1) Very wide field of view capturing significant arc portion (fish-eye lens effect), 2) Higher altitude where arc becomes more pronounced (typically 35,000+ feet for subtle perception, 60,000+ feet for clear perception). Airplane window photos at 67,000-70,000 feet show curvature because altitude is 25-30x higher than Burj Khalifa, greatly increasing visible arc. Additionally, those photos may use wide-angle lenses naturally showing more curvature. Calculation: At 2,722 feet altitude, horizon distance = √(2 × radius × height) = √(2 × 3,959 miles × 0.515 miles) = √4,077 = 64 miles. Over 64-mile radius circle, Earth curves such that far side of visible circle is ~2,722 feet lower than observer (equal to altitude), but this creates gentle arc not straight drop. Angular subtense of this curvature across observer's field of view (typically 60-90 degrees) is fraction of degree - below threshold for perception as curved line versus straight line. Red line drawn across bottom photograph is itself suspicious - appears to be added digitally to emphasize "straight" horizon, but such lines can create illusion of flatness even on gently curved surface by averaging across arc. Meme selectively compares incomparable conditions: ultra-high altitude airplane views showing curvature to much lower building view where curvature is geometrically negligible. This is false equivalency fallacy. Proper comparison would be: Burj Khalifa view vs airplane at equivalent 2,700 feet altitude (also showing apparently flat horizon), or high-altitude airplane vs spacecraft at similar altitude both showing curvature. MythBusters reference may be misquoted or taken out of context. Show known for rigorous testing and explaining scientific principles accurately. If they discussed 2,500 feet, likely referred to theoretical measurability with instruments, not obvious visibility. Meme's rhetorical strategy exploits scale misunderstanding to create apparent contradiction where none exists. Effective propaganda because requires understanding of geometry, perspective, and scale to debunk - casual viewer sees "simple" contradiction suggesting conspiracy or error.5:T14a1,Aerial river system photograph claiming rivers prove flat Earth. Aerial or satellite photograph showing braided river system from high altitude with text claiming rivers' behavior proves Earth must be flat. Image shows dramatic natural landscape - complex river system viewed from airplane or satellite creating intricate patterns across terrain. River appears as braided channel system - multiple interconnected channels weaving, splitting, and rejoining across wide floodplain creating characteristic anastomosing (braided) pattern. Channels appear as darker blue-gray ribbons contrasting with lighter tan/beige sediment deposits between channels. River flows across frame from upper right toward lower left, channels constantly dividing around sediment islands/bars then merging again. Braided rivers form when river carries heavy sediment load and has variable flow, creating constantly shifting channels. Sediment deposits appear as lighter colored areas - sandbars, islands, floodplain deposits showing where sediment settles during lower flow. Some vegetated areas visible as slightly darker patches. Water in channels shows various blue tones suggesting different depths or turbidity. Background shows broader landscape context - appears to be coastal or delta region where river meets larger water body. Horizon visible in distance showing water or ocean in blue-gray tones. Sky above shows gradient from pale blue at horizon to deeper blue higher up, with wispy white clouds creating subtle patterns. Atmospheric perspective makes distant features appear hazier. Landscape appears relatively flat/low-relief typical of river deltas or alluvial plains where sediment deposition creates level terrain. Text overlay at top in large white sans-serif letters: "RIVERS PROVE FLAT EARTH" making bold claim about implications of river behavior. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme's argument: Rivers flow to sea finding lowest level, water always seeks level surface, rivers create flat plains through sediment deposition, therefore Earth must be flat for rivers to function. Logic suggests water couldn't flow "around curve" or rivers would have to flow uphill over Earth's curvature. However, argument fundamentally misunderstands gravity and how "level" works on spherical planet. Scientific reality: 1) Rivers flow downhill following gravity gradient toward Earth's center, not geometric level independent of gravity. "Level" means perpendicular to gravity vector (toward Earth's center), not parallel to geometric plane. On spherical Earth, "level" at all points means following surface curvature - what we perceive as level surface is actually curved surface equidistant from Earth's center. 2) Water seeks lowest gravitational potential energy, which means closest to Earth's center of mass. On sphere, this creates curved surface (geoid) following Earth's shape. Rivers flow "downhill" along this curved surface toward sea level (which is itself curved surface equidistant from Earth's center). 3) Rivers don't need to "know" Earth is round - just follow gravity. Gravity points toward Earth's center from all locations, so water naturally follows curved paths. Same principle explains why oceans curve with Earth - water surface always perpendicular to gravity vector. 4) River behavior (meandering, braiding, delta formation) results from local topography, sediment load, flow dynamics - same processes work identically whether Earth is spherical or flat. River science (fluvial geomorphology) uses consistent physics that actually requires spherical Earth for global patterns. Rivers shown in photograph demonstrate normal fluvial processes: braided pattern forms when sediment load exceeds transport capacity causing channel splitting; occurs on both large and small scales worldwide; requires no assumption about Earth's global shape - only local gravity and topography. If Earth were truly flat plane: 1) Gravity would point toward geometric center of plane (not uniformly "down"), causing bizarre water flow patterns, 2) Rivers at different locations would flow in unexpected directions, 3) Sea level wouldn't be consistent across oceans. On spherical Earth: 1) Gravity points toward Earth's center from all locations, 2) "Down" always means toward center, 3) Rivers naturally flow toward oceans following curved surface, 4) Sea level is geoid surface equidistant from Earth's center (corrected for rotation), naturally curves with planet. Mathematical proof: River delta at sea level, river source at elevation 1000 feet. Elevation measured relative to sea level (geoid surface), which follows Earth's curvature. River flows 1000 feet "downhill" following curved gravity gradient. No flowing "around curve" - gravity defines "down" at each point. Meme's visual evidence is irrelevant to claim - rivers would look identical on flat or spherical Earth when viewed from above over limited area. Global river patterns (directions of flow, continental drainage divides, ocean connectivity) make sense on spherical Earth with consistent gravity, but would be chaotic on flat plane with geometric center gravity. Actually proves opposite of claim: rivers' consistent behavior worldwide confirms spherical Earth with uniform gravity field.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-351","title":"Other 351","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806182_473326522867087_8485398906805130981_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-350","title":"Other 350","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806165_472737672925972_4414938429678510550_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-352","title":"Other 352","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12809647_471367233063016_5011649272723625420_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
