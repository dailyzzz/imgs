5:T896,Flat Earth map with Antarctica ice wall questioning what lies beyond. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with curiosity about unexplored regions. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline and blue 3D effect: 'WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS...' Image shows circular flat Earth map viewed from above with North Pole at center. Map displays continents in yellow-green color against dark navy blue ocean. White ice/snow covers Antarctic perimeter forming ring around entire edge. Visible landmasses include: North America on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe upper left, Asia across top and left, Australia lower left, Greenland near center. Geographic features show terrain texture with mountain ranges, plains visible in relief. Antarctica shown as thick white irregular band encircling entire map edge - much larger than actual continent. Center-left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in translucent text. Red oval circle drawn around large area of Southern Ocean/Antarctica region with small gray alien figure standing in center of oval holding red question mark above its head. Alien depicted in classic style - large head, big black eyes, small gray body, thin limbs. Bottom text in matching bold white letters with blue 3D effect: 'WHAT'S OVER HERE?' Text and alien placement suggests mystery about Antarctic regions, implying hidden lands, civilizations, or phenomena beyond ice wall in flat Earth model. Common flat Earth claim that Antarctica isn't continent but massive ice wall preventing access to whatever lies beyond (more land, edge of world, dome boundary). Treaty restrictions on Antarctic travel cited as evidence of cover-up. However, Antarctica is well-mapped continent (5.5 million sq mi, about twice size of Australia), explored extensively since 1820s. Thousands of scientists from dozens of nations work at research stations year-round. Antarctic Treaty (1961) protects continent for peaceful scientific research, prohibits military activity, allows anyone to visit with proper permits/logistics. Satellite imagery, aircraft surveys, ground expeditions confirm it's continent surrounded by ocean, not ice wall surrounding flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 299 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth map with Antarctica ice wall questioning what lies beyond.
