3:T896,Flat Earth map with Antarctica ice wall questioning what lies beyond. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with curiosity about unexplored regions. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline and blue 3D effect: 'WHAT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS...' Image shows circular flat Earth map viewed from above with North Pole at center. Map displays continents in yellow-green color against dark navy blue ocean. White ice/snow covers Antarctic perimeter forming ring around entire edge. Visible landmasses include: North America on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe upper left, Asia across top and left, Australia lower left, Greenland near center. Geographic features show terrain texture with mountain ranges, plains visible in relief. Antarctica shown as thick white irregular band encircling entire map edge - much larger than actual continent. Center-left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in translucent text. Red oval circle drawn around large area of Southern Ocean/Antarctica region with small gray alien figure standing in center of oval holding red question mark above its head. Alien depicted in classic style - large head, big black eyes, small gray body, thin limbs. Bottom text in matching bold white letters with blue 3D effect: 'WHAT'S OVER HERE?' Text and alien placement suggests mystery about Antarctic regions, implying hidden lands, civilizations, or phenomena beyond ice wall in flat Earth model. Common flat Earth claim that Antarctica isn't continent but massive ice wall preventing access to whatever lies beyond (more land, edge of world, dome boundary). Treaty restrictions on Antarctic travel cited as evidence of cover-up. However, Antarctica is well-mapped continent (5.5 million sq mi, about twice size of Australia), explored extensively since 1820s. Thousands of scientists from dozens of nations work at research stations year-round. Antarctic Treaty (1961) protects continent for peaceful scientific research, prohibits military activity, allows anyone to visit with proper permits/logistics. Satellite imagery, aircraft surveys, ground expeditions confirm it's continent surrounded by ocean, not ice wall surrounding flat Earth4:T805,Bob Ross painting fake globe Earth meme. Humorous image macro using beloved TV painter Bob Ross to suggest Earth imagery is fabricated art. Image shows Bob Ross in his iconic pose from 'The Joy of Painting' PBS television series. Ross wears light blue button-up shirt, stands beside easel holding wooden palette with paint colors in left hand, paintbrush in right hand. He has distinctive large curly afro hairstyle (dark brown), full beard, warm friendly smile. Background shows his painting studio with windows, white walls, painting supplies visible. On easel canvas displays painting of Earth from space - Blue Marble-style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents (appears to show North and South America). Painting looks photorealistic in style matching NASA Earth imagery. Upper left corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'LET'S JUST PAINT A FAKE LITTLE GLOBE IN THERE'. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Meme plays on Bob Ross's famous gentle phrases from his show ('happy little trees', 'happy little clouds') applying them to suggest NASA Earth images are literally paintings rather than photographs. Implies space agencies create artistic renderings and present them as authentic photos. Suggests deception - 'fake little globe' painted for propaganda purposes. However, Earth images come from multiple independent sources over 60+ years: Apollo missions, International Space Station, dozens of weather satellites, communications satellites, various nations' space programs (USA, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India), commercial satellites, astronauts from 40+ countries. Thousands of images from different angles, seasons, times, cameras all showing same spherical Earth. While some images are composites (multiple satellite passes stitched together) or enhanced for visibility, they're based on real photographic/sensor data, not paintings. Bob Ross himself would have appreciated actual beauty of Earth from space5:T85f,Rambo giving thumbs up covered in blood after researching flat Earth all night. Humorous meme using Sylvester Stallone's Rambo character to depict exhaustion after conspiracy research. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING FLAT EARTH ALL NIGHT'. Image shows action movie still from Rambo film series. Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo appears battle-worn and bloodied but defiant. He's soaking wet with water dripping from face and body, dark hair plastered to head. Face and body covered in mud, dirt, blood, scratches showing intense combat. Wears dark olive/gray tactical shirt or vest, visible muscular arms with dirt and abrasions. Despite injuries, Rambo gives enthusiastic double thumbs-up gesture with both hands raised - exaggerated positive response suggesting satisfaction despite physical toll. Facial expression shows gritted teeth, intense eyes, strained smile - combination of pain and triumph. Background blurred showing green foliage suggesting jungle or wilderness setting typical of Rambo films. Upper right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'AND SOMEONE ASKS IF YOU'RE OK'. Meme compares deep-dive flat Earth research session to intense physical battle - emerging bloodied, exhausted, traumatized but claiming to be fine. Thumbs-up despite obvious distress represents flat Earther's enthusiasm about 'discoveries' even when mentally drained from hours consuming conspiracy content. Humor comes from absurd juxtaposition of Rambo's extreme combat injuries with simple question about wellbeing, and from relating intense action movie imagery to sitting at computer watching YouTube videos. Reflects experience of falling into conspiracy rabbit hole - staying up all night watching videos, reading forums, losing sleep, becoming increasingly agitated/paranoid, then insisting everything's great when concerned friends/family check in. Format resonates because conspiracy research can indeed be mentally/emotionally draining, though comparing it to Rambo's literal warfare is obviously hyperbolic comedic exaggeration0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-299","title":"Other 299","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744465_467888163410923_8086078284972262480_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-298","title":"Other 298","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744462_466915816841491_4527401067199396542_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-300","title":"Other 300","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744541_465992210267185_6200758682558836362_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
