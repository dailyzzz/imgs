3:T4c8,Dramatic ocean sunset photograph with claim about scientific proof. Shows vast dark blue-gray ocean water in foreground extending to horizon. Sky dominates upper two-thirds of image with spectacular cloud formations - dark gray storm clouds with bright pink-orange-coral illumination from setting sun breaking through gaps. Brilliant yellow-orange glow visible at horizon line creating natural backlight. Pink and orange colors reflect off cloud undersides creating dramatic atmospheric effect. Horizon appears perfectly flat where dark ocean meets illuminated sky. White text overlay in center reads: 'There is an abundance of science that has PROVED the flat earth model but nothing has ever proven curvature or a globe.' Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Makes bold empirical claim that scientific evidence supports flat Earth while no evidence proves spherical Earth or curvature. Argues burden of proof lies with globe Earth proponents to demonstrate curvature, suggesting flat appearance is default observable reality requiring no proof. Uses dramatic natural scene to create emotional appeal - viewer sees flat horizon, reinforcing message that direct observation supports flat Earth4:T530,Serene sunset photograph over large body of water with superior mirage question. Shows brilliant orange-yellow sun partially visible above horizon with gray-orange clouds above. Sun creates golden reflection column stretching vertically down across calm water surface toward viewer. Sky transitions from peachy-orange near sun through tan/beige tones to darker gray at top. Multiple dark birds silhouetted in flight - one upper left, one upper right, one middle-right, one lower center. Distant city skyline visible as thin dark silhouette on horizon to left of sun. Foreground shows dark shoreline with silhouettes of people - person sitting/crouching on left, two figures standing together on right. Water appears almost mirror-smooth with gentle ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level. Large bold white text at bottom: 'SUPERIOR MIRAGE?' Questions whether sun's appearance at sunset/sunrise is optical illusion (superior mirage) caused by atmospheric refraction rather than actual position. Superior mirages occur when temperature inversions bend light rays, making objects appear higher than actual location. Flat Earth proponents question whether sun truly sets below horizon or merely appears to due to perspective and atmospheric effects, suggesting sun circles above flat plane rather than Earth rotating5:T579,Samuel Birley Rowbotham quote over stunning twilight castle photograph. Shows famous Chillon Castle on Lake Geneva, Switzerland at dusk. Medieval stone castle with cylindrical towers, turrets, and battlements sits on rocky outcrop extending into calm lake water. Warm golden lighting illuminates castle's yellow-beige stone walls. Castle reflection perfectly mirrored in still dark blue water below. Left side shows silhouetted mountain range extending into distance. Sky transitions from deep blue at top through pink-lavender tones to lighter blue near horizon. Lake surface appears completely flat and mirror-smooth. White text overlay at top reads: 'The facts and experiments already advanced render it undeniable, that the surface of all the waters of the earth is horizontal; and that, however irregular the upper outline of the land itself may be, the whole mass, land and water together, constitutes an IMMENSE NON-MOVING CIRCULAR PLANE.' Attribution: '- Samuel Birley Rowbotham'. Bottom left watermark 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Quote from Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816-1884), founder of modern flat Earth movement who wrote under pseudonym 'Parallax'. His book 'Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe' (1865) laid foundation for contemporary flat Earth arguments. Quote presents water's levelness as empirical proof Earth is stationary flat plane rather than rotating sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-159","title":"Other 159","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489280_454501514749588_7952754270576694147_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-158","title":"Other 158","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12487091_450548285144911_6905234098492399288_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-160","title":"Other 160","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12489299_452833058249767_7799870234697648772_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
