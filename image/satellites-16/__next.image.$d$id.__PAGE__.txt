Left panel shows 'NASAs first communication satellite launches in 1964' with black and white photograph of large spherical metallic balloon satellite labeled 'N.A.S.A.' on ground with launch infrastructure and workers visible in background. Right panel titled 'NASA 5 summers later in 1969' with thinking face emoji and double exclamation marks shows two iconic Apollo images: top shows Earth photographed from space (blue marble), bottom shows astronauts on lunar surface with American flag and lunar module. Satirical timeline suggesting NASA advanced impossibly fast from basic balloon satellite technology in 1964 to manned moon landing with complex spacecraft just 5 years later, questioning credibility of claimed rapid technological progress. Implies Moon landing may have been fabricated given limited satellite capabilities shortly before."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-15","title":"Satellites 15","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/48361141_10156374359918171_3481517403718811648_n.jpeg","description":"Sarcastic meme with CGI satellite image against Earth background. Shows gold/bronze colored satellite with extended solar panel arrays orbiting above Earth's blue atmosphere with white clouds visible. Large yellow text at top: 'REMEMBER THAT TIME THEY SOLVED A CRIME USING SATELLITES?' followed by bottom yellow text: 'ME EITHER.' Dark blue gradient sky transitioning to Earth curve at bottom. Satirical commentary suggesting satellites are never actually used to solve crimes despite claims of sophisticated surveillance capabilities, questioning whether functional orbital satellites exist at all or if crime-solving satellite surveillance is fictional/exaggerated in media. Implies satellite technology may not have practical real-world crime prevention/investigation applications despite popular perception from movies and TV shows."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-17","title":"Satellites 17","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/69556840_10157400584966465_6891336740817076224_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with text 'SATELLITES ARE REAL' at top showing crashed satellite equipment on suburban residential lawn. Large partially-deflated white weather balloon or satellite balloon lies on grass near street with yellow caution tape marking scene. Palm trees, power lines, residential homes, parked cars, and person standing nearby visible. Equipment appears to have crashed or landed in neighborhood. CBS San Francisco and EARTHISAPLANE watermarks visible. Bottom text: 'THEY'RE FLOATING ON BALLOONS, NOT IN ORBIT AROUND A BALL'. Presents crashed satellite balloon as evidence that satellites are high-altitude balloon platforms rather than orbiting spacecraft, suggesting 'satellites' are actually tethered or free-floating balloons in stratosphere rather than space-based technology."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
