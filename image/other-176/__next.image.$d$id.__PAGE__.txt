3:T4ab,Freemason 666 numerology meme connecting Earth measurements. Dark red gradient background with black water reflection effect. Top banner in distressed red text: 'FREEMASON SCIENCE'. White text states: 'Earth revolves around the sun at:' followed by large yellow numbers '66,600 mph'. Next line: 'Curvature of one square mile:' with yellow numbers '.666 ft.' with small degree symbol. Bottom section shows 'Earth tilts at:' with large yellow '66.6°'. Right side displays CGI globe Earth partially submerged in dark red water showing Africa, Europe, Mediterranean visible in green/tan/blue. Bottom text in distressed red: 'STILL THINK IT'S ALL A COINCIDENCE?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in bottom right. Conspiracy theory connects repeating 666 pattern (number of the beast from Revelation) in Earth's orbital speed, curvature calculation, and axial tilt. Implies Freemasons designed heliocentric model using occult numerology rather than empirical measurements. Argues these suspiciously similar numbers prove globe Earth is Satanic deception. Uses apocalyptic imagery (blood-red sky/water, sinking Earth) to create ominous atmosphere. Suggests mainstream astronomy encodes hidden occult knowledge4:T485,Chuck Norris action hero meme rejecting gravity. Shows iconic 1980s/90s photograph of Chuck Norris in classic action hero pose. Norris wears sleeveless light blue denim shirt with chest exposed, brown hair and beard. Holds two large black handguns (possibly Uzis or MAC-10s) pointed in opposite directions with dramatic tough-guy stance. Smoky dark background creates action movie atmosphere. White speech bubble at top left: 'suck it, gravity'. Bottom text in white: 'Next time you hear someone use "gravity" as an excuse for some global miracle, switch it to Chuck Norris. It will still be a joke, but at least Chuck Norris exists.' Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Uses Chuck Norris Facts meme format (hyperbolic jokes about Norris defying physics/logic) to mock gravity as explanation for Earth's phenomena. Argues gravity is unproven theoretical force like fictional Chuck Norris superpowers. Suggests replacing gravity with Chuck Norris in scientific explanations makes equal sense because neither can be directly observed. Implies gravity is convenient magical explanation for how globe Earth functions, no more real than action hero mythology5:T47e,Universal Pictures logo parody reading 'UNIVERSAL LIE'. Black starry space background with blue nebula clouds. Center shows illuminated spherical globe Earth with city lights visible on night side, blue oceans and green-brown continents on day side. Bright white-yellow sun rising behind Earth creating lens flare and atmospheric glow. Large white metallic 3D text with chrome/silver effect reads 'UNIVERSAL LIE' in Universal Pictures studio logo font style, with trademark circle-R symbol. Text arcs above and around Earth mimicking iconic movie studio opening. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in semi-transparent text. Parodies Universal Pictures' famous logo/intro showing spinning globe with company name. Replaces 'Universal' with 'Universal Lie' to suggest globe Earth model is worldwide deception perpetuated by media/Hollywood. Implies entertainment industry complicit in maintaining heliocentric lie through constant subliminal messaging. Uses familiar cinematic branding to make point that movies/TV condition masses to accept spherical Earth without question. Argues Hollywood serves as propaganda arm for globe Earth narrative0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-176","title":"Other 176","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512420_483466411853098_1470728874970540080_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-175","title":"Other 175","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512370_480994238766982_5452094373629189205_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-177","title":"Other 177","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512544_462324730633933_6184343257982206791_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
