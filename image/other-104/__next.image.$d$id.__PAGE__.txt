Top panel labeled 'Science on the Flat earth' shows two scientists in white lab coats and safety goggles conducting laboratory experiment with glassware containing colorful liquids (beaker with purple liquid, test tube with orange liquid), microscope visible in background, professional laboratory setting. Bottom panel labeled 'Science on the globe' shows hands using calculator with person wearing glasses looking at camera, calculator display visible showing numbers. Green banner for flat Earth, blue banner for globe. Bottom red banner shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' watermark. Satirical comparison suggesting flat Earth science involves rigorous experimental work while globe Earth science relies solely on mathematical calculations without empirical testing. Implies mainstream science uses abstract math rather than observable experiments, while flat Earth proponents conduct hands-on research"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-103","title":"Other 103","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10245_448476382018768_8185423063224913829_n.jpg","description":"Atmospheric photograph of crepuscular rays over water with educational text. Header 'CREPUSCULAR RAYS' in white bold letters. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene over calm ocean with military ships silhouetted on horizon. Multiple distinct light beams (crepuscular rays) radiate downward from gaps in dark gray storm clouds, creating spectacular fan pattern. Rays appear to converge toward light source behind clouds. Golden-orange sunlight illuminates water surface. Dark hills/land visible on right horizon. Green vegetation silhouette in foreground. Bottom text states 'TELL US THE SUN IS CLOSE' in white letters. Presents crepuscular rays as evidence for nearby local sun rather than distant 93-million-mile sun. Argues visible convergence of light rays demonstrates perspective effect from close light source, similar to how railroad tracks appear to converge. Questions how parallel rays from distant sun would create such obvious convergence pattern"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-105","title":"Other 105","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10268717_474792612720478_2806422081768567871_n.jpg","description":"Azimuthal equidistant projection map visualization showing global flight path network. Circular map centered on North Pole with π (pi) symbol in center. Concentric rings mark hours (//1, //2, etc. up to //9) radiating outward. Blue represents oceans, green/tan/orange represents continents. Thousands of white lines crisscross map showing flight paths or connections between locations, creating dense web pattern concentrated in Northern Hemisphere with fewer connections to Southern Hemisphere. Heavy concentration of routes between North America, Europe, and Asia. Bottom credit '©Ashlee Filopard Webster'. Azimuthal equidistant projection preserves distances from center point, making it useful for aviation and radio communication but creates distortions at edges. In flat Earth discourse, this projection is sometimes presented as actual Earth map showing true flight paths, though it's mathematical projection of spherical Earth onto flat surface"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
