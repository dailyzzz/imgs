Chart displays labeled constellations positioned around central North Star: 'Spring' constellation in upper right, 'Summer' constellation in left with crescent moon below, 'Fall' constellation at bottom, and 'Winter' constellation in right. White lines connect stars to form constellation patterns, with arrows indicating directional relationships between constellations and North Star. Silhouetted treeline visible at bottom against twilight-colored horizon. Demonstrates how stars appear to rotate around fixed North Star throughout year, supporting flat Earth model where celestial sphere rotates above stationary plane with Polaris at apex"},"prevImage":{"id":"earth-19","title":"Earth 19","category":"earth","categoryDisplay":"Earth","src":"/images/gallery/earth/39514684_856335964556027_1688391630203125760_n.jpeg","description":"Sixteen-panel grid displaying swastika and similar rotating symbols from different ancient cultures.
