3:T506,Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, stern expression. Top text in large white letters: 'HI, I'M ALBERT MICHELSON, AMERICAN PHYSICIST'. Bottom text: 'MY EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT EARTH DOES NOT ROTATE'. References Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) which attempted to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether by measuring speed of light in different directions. Experiment yielded null result - found no difference in light speed regardless of Earth's motion direction. Meme claims this proves Earth doesn't rotate/move. Misinterpretation: null result didn't prove stationary Earth; instead led to abandonment of aether theory and development of special relativity showing light speed is constant in all reference frames regardless of observer motion. Michelson himself accepted Earth's motion and interpreted results as challenging aether concept, not heliocentrism. Selective presentation of experimental results divorced from actual scientific interpretation and Michelson's own conclusions. Part of pattern citing pre-relativity experiments as proof of geocentrism while ignoring that relativity theory explains these results while maintaining Earth's motion.4:T4bb,Humorous meme featuring white fluffy Persian cat wearing oversized round black glasses and red bow tie, sitting at laboratory workbench with chemistry equipment. Background shows green chalkboard covered with white chemical formulas and equations (CH³, HB₃, Log, Ph²). Foreground displays colorful chemistry glassware: conical flasks with blue, red/orange, clear liquids, Erlenmeyer flasks, beakers with colored solutions on wooden lab bench. Top text in large white letters: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED'. Bottom text: 'THAT YOU WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'VE DISCOVERED.' Satirical meta-commentary on public trust in scientific authority and announcements. Can be interpreted multiple ways: critique of blind faith in science without understanding methodology, skepticism about sensationalized science journalism, or anti-science sentiment questioning all scientific findings. In flat Earth context, used to argue people uncritically accept mainstream scientific claims (like globe Earth) without personal verification. Ironically, meme itself relies on comedic appeal rather than reasoned argument, using cute cat to make philosophical point about epistemology and trust in expert authority.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-32","title":"Pseudo Science 32","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46470458_10212799227198744_2174079361102118912_n-1.jpeg","description":"Two-panel educational meme titled 'Experiments Prove Earth at Rest' showing table with five experiments and their proofs: Airy's Failure (Starlight moves, Telescope remains stationary), Michelson-Morley (No rotation of earth), Michelson-Gale (Aether moves, not earth), Sagnac (Light travels through the aether, No vacuum exists), Bedford Level (Zero curvature in 6 miles of canal) with technical diagrams on right side.
