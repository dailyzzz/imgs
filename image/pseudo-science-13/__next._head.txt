5:T417,Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of man in glasses, white collar shirt with polka dot tie, formal suit. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'There was just one alternative; the earth's true velocity through space might happen to have been nil.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, ARTHUR EDDINGTON •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. Quote from Arthur Eddington (British astrophysicist famous for 1919 solar eclipse expedition confirming Einstein's general relativity) discussing theoretical possibility that Earth could have zero velocity through space, taken out of context to suggest stationary Earth. Historical context: quote likely from discussing Michelson-Morley experiment results and philosophical interpretation of reference frames, not actual endorsement of geocentrism. Eddington was prominent advocate of relativity theory. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's acknowledgment of null hypothesis as support for stationary Earth model.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 13 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of man in glasses, white collar shirt with polka dot tie, formal suit.
