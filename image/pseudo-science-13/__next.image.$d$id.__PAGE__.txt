Yellow text quote: 'There was just one alternative; the earth's true velocity through space might happen to have been nil.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, ARTHUR EDDINGTON •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. Quote from Arthur Eddington (British astrophysicist famous for 1919 solar eclipse expedition confirming Einstein's general relativity) discussing theoretical possibility that Earth could have zero velocity through space, taken out of context to suggest stationary Earth. Historical context: quote likely from discussing Michelson-Morley experiment results and philosophical interpretation of reference frames, not actual endorsement of geocentrism. Eddington was prominent advocate of relativity theory. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's acknowledgment of null hypothesis as support for stationary Earth model.4:T492,Quote meme with famous black and white portrait of Albert Einstein with characteristic wild gray hair, mustache, wearing wool sweater, looking directly at camera with gentle expression. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'We can't feel our motion through space, nor has any physical experiment ever proved that the Earth actually is in motion.' followed by attribution '• HISTORIAN, LINCOLN BARNETT, FOREWORD BY ALBERT EINSTEIN •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote attributed to Lincoln Barnett (science writer) with Einstein's endorsement via foreword, discussing perceptual and experimental challenges in detecting Earth's motion. Taken out of context - quote likely discusses principle of relativity (motion is relative to reference frame) rather than denying Earth's motion. Selective quote mining using Einstein's association to suggest even relativity theory supports stationary Earth, though Einstein's work assumes Earth orbits Sun and explains why uniform motion cannot be detected from within moving reference frame. Conflates inability to feel/measure absolute motion with claim Earth is stationary.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-13","title":"Pseudo Science 13","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396884_247796042375209_2210450211636051693_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-12","title":"Pseudo Science 12","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396806_247796025708544_5954844160917119702_n.jpeg","description":"Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of elderly physicist with white beard and mustache wearing dark suit, sitting at desk with book or papers.

Quote from Hendrik Lorentz (Dutch physicist who developed Lorentz transformations used in special relativity) discussing how physical observations from Earth's reference frame appear consistent with stationary Earth. Quote taken out of context - Lorentz was discussing reference frame equivalence and transformation equations that allow calculations from Earth's perspective while accepting Earth's actual motion. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's statement about mathematical reference frames as admission of geocentrism, though Lorentz accepted heliocentric model and his work underlies modern relativity theory."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-14","title":"Pseudo Science 14","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19400126_247795952375218_613806335517901807_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
