13:T541,Text-based quote meme with black background and white text. Title: 'Catholic Priest Andrew Pinsent' with subtitle 'Research Director of the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion at Oxford University'. Body text reads: 'Being both a priest and a former particle physicist at CERN, I am often asked to give talks on faith and science. Quite often young people ask me the following question, "How can you be a priest and believe in the Big Bang?" To which I am delighted to respond,' followed by quote: '"We invented it! Or more precisely, Priest Georges Lemaître invented the theory that is today called the 'Big Bang' and everyone should know about him."' Source URL shown: '(http://thesestonewalls.com/gordon-macrae/fr-georges-lemaitre-father-big-bang-2/)' with small colorful logo in bottom right. Emphasizes that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, presenting as point of pride for Catholic Church's contribution to science. Used in various contexts: Catholics cite as evidence of church supporting science; skeptics use to suggest Big Bang is religious doctrine rather than empirical science. Quote demonstrates compatibility of religious faith and scientific work, though Lemaître kept domains separate and his theory was validated through observational evidence regardless of his religious affiliation.14:T625,Quote meme showing elderly scientist or professor in formal dark suit with blue tie standing in front of white background covered with handwritten mathematical equations, integrals, logarithms, and calculus formulas. Man has white hair, gesturing with both hands raised as if explaining or lecturing. Wooden desk/podium on left side. Surrounding him are complex mathematical expressions including integrals (∫), logarithms (log₂), trigonometric functions (cos, sin), fractions, exponents, square roots. Bottom quote in black text: '"Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."' Attribution: '-Nikola Tesla'. Quote criticizes modern theoretical physics for relying too heavily on mathematical abstraction rather than empirical experimentation, claiming mathematical models become divorced from physical reality. Used to argue contemporary science (particularly relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology) is purely theoretical construction without experimental basis. Context: Tesla was experimental physicist who favored hands-on laboratory work over theoretical mathematics. Quote reflects his methodological preference but oversimplifies relationship between theory and experiment in modern physics. Ironic given that Tesla's own electromagnetic work is described mathematically and many theoretical predictions (gravitational waves, Higgs boson, etc.) were later experimentally confirmed decades after mathematical prediction.15:T506,Meme featuring formal black and white portrait photograph of Albert Michelson in early 1900s formal attire with high collar, mustache, slicked-back hair, stern expression. Top text in large white letters: 'HI, I'M ALBERT MICHELSON, AMERICAN PHYSICIST'. Bottom text: 'MY EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT EARTH DOES NOT ROTATE'. References Michelson-Morley experiment (1887) which attempted to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether by measuring speed of light in different directions. Experiment yielded null result - found no difference in light speed regardless of Earth's motion direction. Meme claims this proves Earth doesn't rotate/move. Misinterpretation: null result didn't prove stationary Earth; instead led to abandonment of aether theory and development of special relativity showing light speed is constant in all reference frames regardless of observer motion. Michelson himself accepted Earth's motion and interpreted results as challenging aether concept, not heliocentrism. Selective presentation of experimental results divorced from actual scientific interpretation and Michelson's own conclusions. Part of pattern citing pre-relativity experiments as proof of geocentrism while ignoring that relativity theory explains these results while maintaining Earth's motion.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-30","title":"Pseudo Science 30","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/41490543_2074782412546446_4904383431149879296_n.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-29","title":"Pseudo Science 29","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/41195629_1996823577008854_8576308533375533056_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-31","title":"Pseudo Science 31","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/46040789_360192281394415_139384281599311872_n.jpeg","description":"$15"}}]
