5:T541,Text-based quote meme with black background and white text. Title: 'Catholic Priest Andrew Pinsent' with subtitle 'Research Director of the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion at Oxford University'. Body text reads: 'Being both a priest and a former particle physicist at CERN, I am often asked to give talks on faith and science. Quite often young people ask me the following question, "How can you be a priest and believe in the Big Bang?" To which I am delighted to respond,' followed by quote: '"We invented it! Or more precisely, Priest Georges Lemaître invented the theory that is today called the 'Big Bang' and everyone should know about him."' Source URL shown: '(http://thesestonewalls.com/gordon-macrae/fr-georges-lemaitre-father-big-bang-2/)' with small colorful logo in bottom right. Emphasizes that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître, presenting as point of pride for Catholic Church's contribution to science. Used in various contexts: Catholics cite as evidence of church supporting science; skeptics use to suggest Big Bang is religious doctrine rather than empirical science. Quote demonstrates compatibility of religious faith and scientific work, though Lemaître kept domains separate and his theory was validated through observational evidence regardless of his religious affiliation.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 30 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Text-based quote meme with black background and white text.
