3:T368e,Absurdist meme of cowboy riding missile-straddling dinosaur shooting shark with text mocking NASA photo authentication. Surreal photoshopped composite image creating impossible scenario to satirize claims that any NASA photograph must be authentic. Image uses deliberately ridiculous, obviously fake composition to mock argument "If photo is on NASA website, it must be real." Meme operates through reductio ad absurdum - if NASA presence validates any image regardless of content, then even absurd impossible image should be believed if NASA hosted it. Central figure is Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur in brown/green coloration with typical T-Rex features - massive head with enormous jaws full of sharp teeth, tiny forearms, powerful hind legs, thick tail extending behind. Dinosaur appears in aggressive posture with mouth open showing teeth, suggesting attacking or roaring. Dinosaur rendered in semi-realistic style (possibly from documentary or film CGI, or photoshopped from museum skeleton/model). Mounted ON TOP of dinosaur's back is human figure wearing cowboy outfit - appears to be man in Western attire with cowboy hat, possibly jeans/shirt typical of Wild West imagery. Cowboy sits astride T-Rex like riding horse, in action pose suggesting rodeo or cavalry charge. Cowboy holds weapon aimed forward - appears to be rifle or similar firearm. Pose suggests Old West gunfighter or cavalry soldier, transplanted into context of riding dinosaur into battle. Beneath/between dinosaur's legs is SHARK suspended in mid-air - appears to be great white shark based on size, coloration (gray back, white underside), dorsal fin. Shark positioned horizontally in swimming pose but floating impossibly in air beneath dinosaur without water or support. Shark's mouth open showing rows of sharp teeth. Shark scale seems roughly proportional to dinosaur size, creating bizarre menagerie of predators from different eras/environments impossibly combined. Most absurd element: MISSILE or ROCKET positioned between dinosaur and shark. Large military-style missile appears horizontally oriented, gray/silver metal surface with tail fins, pointed nose cone, exhaust trail suggesting propulsion. Missile positioned as if dinosaur is straddling it while rocket fires - imagine rodeo rider on bull, but bull is dinosaur-missile hybrid. Cowboy appears to be RIDING this dinosaur-missile contraption while SHOOTING at shark. Entire composition violates physics, biology, chronology, basic reality. Background appears to be outdoor sky - light blue color with some cloud texture suggesting this scene supposedly occurring in Earth's atmosphere. Ground may be partially visible at bottom suggesting scene near surface. Overall lighting suggests daytime, though shadows inconsistent (common in amateur Photoshop composites). Image quality varies across elements suggesting different source materials composited together - some elements sharp, others blurrier, lighting directions inconsistent, scale relationships questionable. Obviously amateur Photoshop work, intentionally bad composition for comedic effect. Text overlays in white sans-serif font with black outlines for contrast and readability. Top text in large letters reads: "IT WAS ON THE NASA WEBSITE" in all caps emphasizing supposed authority of NASA hosting. Bottom text continues: "SO IT MUST BE REAL" completing sarcastic argument - if NASA website hosts image, image must be authentic photograph of real event. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Meme satirizes flat Earth community's selective skepticism: 1) MOCKING NASA TRUST: Flat Earthers accuse others of blindly trusting NASA photos of space, Earth from orbit, satellites, astronauts. Argument suggests "globe believers" automatically accept any NASA image as real without critical examination. Meme exaggerates this to absurdity - would you believe cowboys rode missiles on dinosaurs hunting sharks in midair just because image appeared on NASA website? Obviously not. Therefore, implies we shouldn't automatically trust NASA's actual space photography either. 2) REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM: Logical technique of taking opponent's principle to extreme conclusion to show principle is flawed. If "NASA website = proof of authenticity" were valid principle, then this impossible image would be real if NASA posted it. Since that's ridiculous, principle must be wrong. Therefore, NASA's actual space photos might also be fake despite NASA hosting them. 3) PHOTOSHOP ACCUSATIONS: Flat Earth movement frequently accuses NASA of photoshopping Earth images - claims clouds copied/pasted, composites from multiple photos, size of continents changes between images, colors unrealistic. When NASA explains images are composites (necessarily true for whole-Earth views because satellites orbit and Earth rotates - must stitch together images from different times/angles to create full globe view), flat Earthers cite this as admission of fakery. Meme's obvious photoshop (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) is meant to look like NASA's supposed photoshop of space images. 4) APPEAL TO ABSURDITY: By creating maximally absurd scenario (combining predators from land/sea/extinct eras, adding Western cowboy, throwing in missile for extra impossibility, having shark fly without water), meme generates immediate gut response: "This is obviously fake!" Meme then trains that skeptical response onto NASA's legitimate photos: "See how easily fake images can be made? NASA photos could be just as fake, just less obviously." However, meme's logic is flawed: 1) NOBODY CLAIMS NASA HOSTING PROVES AUTHENTICITY: Globe Earth believers don't accept space photos merely because NASA posted them. Photos are accepted because: Multiple space agencies from competing nations (USA/NASA, Russia/Roscosmos, ESA, China/CNSA, India/ISRO, Japan/JAXA, etc.) independently produce similar images of spherical Earth. Private companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Planet Labs, etc.) produce similar images. All consistent with spherical Earth, inconsistent with flat Earth. Images show consistent geography, weather patterns, seasonal changes over decades - impossible to maintain fake consistency across thousands of images from hundreds of missions over 60+ years. Amateur astronomers can photograph satellites in orbit, track ISS, observe objects matching official positions. Photo metadata (EXIF data, spectral analysis, lighting angles) consistent with claimed origins. Physics of optics, orbital mechanics predict exactly what cameras in orbit should see - predictions match photographs. Independent verification from non-governmental sources. Trust isn't blind faith in NASA, but confidence built on multiple independent confirmations. 2) OBVIOUS FAKE VS SOPHISTICATED COMPOSITE: Meme's image is obviously impossible - combines entities that can't coexist (dinosaurs extinct 65 million years ago, sharks need water, missiles didn't exist in dinosaur era, humans came after dinosaurs). Poor photoshop execution (lighting mismatches, scale inconsistencies, unnatural positioning). NASA's images show Earth/space scenes that are physically possible and consistent with physics. Compositing multiple orbital photos into single Earth view is technically necessary and clearly explained, different from fabricating impossible scene. 3) VERIFIABLE VS UNVERIFIABLE: NASA photos can be verified independently through: Launching your own satellite (amateur cubesats do this), high-altitude balloon photography showing curvature, replicating observations (astronauts see Earth rotate, matching rotation rate measured from ground), checking consistency (Earth's geography matches maps derived from ground survey, ship/plane navigation over centuries). Cowboy-dinosaur-shark image can't be verified because scenario never occurred and is physically impossible. 4) STRAWMAN ARGUMENT: Meme attacks argument nobody makes. Scientists/educators don't say "trust NASA because they're NASA." They say "NASA's findings match independent verification, follow from physics, predict observations, and are replicated by other agencies. Therefore NASA's data is reliable." That's evidence-based trust, not blind faith. Meme's effectiveness comes from humor and simplicity: Absurd image is memorable, creates strong emotional response (laughter at absurdity), makes complex issue (how do we verify remote observations?) seem simple ("obviously this is fake, so maybe NASA stuff is too"). Humor bypasses analytical thinking. Meme format allows quick sharing of concept without need for lengthy explanation. Image sticks in memory because of bizarre combination. But meme's logic falls apart under examination: Just because some images are fake doesn't mean all images are fake. Just because Photoshop exists doesn't mean every photo is photoshopped. World would be chaos if we couldn't distinguish between obvious composites (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) and legitimate photography (Earth from space). We successfully make these distinctions constantly - nobody files insurance claims showing alien abduction photos as evidence, courts don't accept photoshopped images as proof, journalists verify photos before publication. Sophisticated methods exist for detecting photo manipulation (forensic analysis of compression artifacts, lighting consistency, metadata examination, shadow angle verification). NASA photos pass these tests. Cowboys-on-dinosaurs photo would immediately fail. Irony: Flat Earthers make this meme while simultaneously asking others to trust their photos/videos as proof of flat Earth - videos of horizon looking flat, ships not disappearing, sun rays through clouds "proving" sun is close, etc. Same skepticism applied to flat Earth evidence would reveal issues: atmospheric refraction, insufficient altitude to see curvature, misunderstanding of perspective, misapplication of geometry. But flat Earthers don't apply critical analysis to their own side's images, only to NASA's. This selective skepticism reveals motivated reasoning - reject evidence contradicting flat Earth regardless of quality, accept evidence supporting flat Earth regardless of flaws. Dinosaur inclusion possibly references young Earth creationism's overlap with flat Earth movement (both reject scientific consensus about Earth, age, evolution). Some flat Earth supporters also believe dinosaurs coexisted with humans based on literal Bible interpretation, making cowboy-riding-dinosaur less absurd in their worldview than intended. Most Americans recognize dinosaurs extinct millions of years before humans, making image obviously impossible. But for young Earth creationists who believe Earth is 6,000-10,000 years old and all animals created simultaneously, humans and dinosaurs might have coexisted. This theological overlap between flat Earth and young Earth creationism suggests image working on multiple levels. Missile/rocket element particularly relevant: Flat Earthers question whether rockets work in vacuum, whether space travel possible, whether missiles follow claimed trajectories. Including missile in absurd composite associates real rocket technology with impossible fantasy scenario. Shark adds aquatic element - flat Earthers often discuss ocean navigation, ships' visibility over water, water's level surface as proof of flat Earth. Shark out of water is impossible, just as they claim satellites in orbit are impossible ("sharks need water to survive, satellites need air to push against" - both statements revealing misunderstanding of respective mediums and physics). Cowboy represents Western American frontier mythology - self-reliant individual who questions authority, trusts personal experience over expert testimony, values common sense over book learning. Archetype flat Earth movement identifies with: modern cowboys questioning scientific establishment, relying on own observations ("I don't see curvature, so Earth must be flat" parallels "I know what I saw" cowboy empiricism). Composite's absurdity is intentional - meant to be shared, laughed at, remembered. Serves as thought-terminating cliche: Instead of examining NASA's evidence, verification methods, independent confirmations, just think of cowboy-dinosaur meme and dismiss all space photography as potentially fake. Reduces complex epistemological question (how do we verify remote observations?) to simple meme-based skepticism. Effectiveness for flat Earth movement: Provides quick, memorable response to space photos. When shown ISS photo of Earth, flat Earther can respond "It's on NASA website so must be real, right?" with knowing sarcasm referencing this meme. Allows dismissal of evidence without engagement. Creates false equivalence between provable photos and absurdist fantasy. But false equivalence is propaganda technique, not logical argument. Real question isn't "Can photos be faked?" (answer: yes) but "Are NASA's specific photos fake?" (answer: no, verified through multiple independent sources). Meme confuses these questions. Ultimate message: Don't trust institutional sources (NASA, government, science agencies), trust only your own observations and alternative community (flat Earth). But human observations are limited - can't see entire Earth at once, can't see far enough to detect curvature without altitude, can't directly sense Earth's rotation, can't visit space without technology. Must rely on instruments, photographs, others' reports to understand phenomena beyond direct experience. Question becomes: Which sources trustworthy? Scientific consensus with peer review, replication, mathematical predictions, multi-national verification? Or YouTube videos and Facebook memes from people with no relevant expertise? Meme answers: Official sources untrustworthy, alternatives more reliable. But provides no method for distinguishing true alternative sources from false ones, creating epistemic chaos where anything can be believed or rejected based on tribal affiliation rather than evidence.4:T3220,Inspirational quote over mountain/coastline scenery encouraging questioning of indoctrination and mockery as paths to truth. Motivational image format popular in flat Earth communities presenting skepticism toward mainstream narratives as virtue, positioning ridicule as evidence of being correct. Background photograph shows dramatic natural landscape - appears to be coastal mountain scene. Lower portion displays calm water (ocean, sea, or large lake) in dark blue-gray tones with gentle ripples suggesting tranquil conditions. Water surface appears smooth, glassy, reflecting light. Water extends to distant shoreline or horizon line creating strong horizontal division across image. Middle ground shows rocky coastline or islands - dark landmass with rugged terrain visible as silhouette against brighter sky. Land appears mountainous with peaks rising from water's edge. Terrain shows irregular outline suggesting volcanic or erosional landscape features. Dark tones create dramatic contrast with sky. Upper portion displays spectacular mountain range in background - high peaks rising above water level. Mountains appear snow-capped with white peaks contrasting against darker slopes below. Mountain range shows multiple peaks creating jagged skyline. Atmospheric perspective makes distant mountains appear slightly hazy, emphasizing great distance and scale. Sky above mountains shows gradient from deep blue at top to lighter tones near horizon where atmosphere thickest. Dramatic cloud formations visible - thick white clouds with gray undersides creating layered structure. Clouds show texture and depth suggesting active weather systems. Lighting appears golden hour (sunrise or sunset) creating warm tones illuminating mountain peaks and cloud edges while valleys remain in shadow. Overall scene conveys majesty of nature, vastness of landscape, sense of exploration and adventure. Composition creates depth layers: water (foreground), rocky coastline (middle), mountains (background), sky (upper frame). Classic landscape photography emphasizing scale and natural beauty. Likely captured in location like Norway, Alaska, Pacific Northwest, Patagonia, or New Zealand - regions with coastal mountains meeting ocean. Text overlay spans center of image in white sans-serif font with black outline ensuring readability against varied background tones. Quote appears in quotation marks indicating it's attributed statement rather than original text. Quote reads: "If your search for truth led you into the conspiracy theories and you are being mocked, ridiculed or discredited, you might be onto something. Never stop questioning the indoctrination we are all born into." Quote broken into multiple lines centered on image creating visually balanced text block. Lower right corner shows "fb.com/fematters" in small white text indicating source as flat Earth community page. Quote presents several arguments meant to encourage and validate conspiracy theorists: 1) SEARCH FOR TRUTH: Frames conspiracy theorizing as truth-seeking endeavor. Suggests mainstream narratives are false and alternative theories (like flat Earth) represent genuine investigation into reality. Positions questioner as researcher, investigator, seeker rather than as someone believing fringe ideas without evidence. Implies conspiracy theorists motivated by noble pursuit of truth rather than psychological needs (pattern-seeking, distrust of authority, need for special knowledge). 2) MOCKERY AS VALIDATION: "If you are being mocked, ridiculed or discredited, you might be onto something" - reverses normal epistemology where widespread rejection suggests error. Reframes mockery as evidence of correctness. Underlying logic: If establishment fears truth, they'll mock truth-tellers to discredit them. Therefore mockery indicates target is threat to official narrative, suggesting target has found truth establishment wants hidden. Persecution complex transforms rejection into confirmation - can't lose this epistemic game because acceptance would confirm correctness and rejection also confirms correctness. 3) NEVER STOP QUESTIONING: Frames persistence despite ridicule as virtuous. Suggests doubt is intellectual courage while acceptance is intellectual cowardice. However, "questioning" here means rejecting mainstream answers, not genuinely examining evidence from all sides. Encourages confirmation bias - continue seeking information supporting conspiracy, dismiss contradicting information as lies/propaganda. 4) INDOCTRINATION FRAMEWORK: "The indoctrination we are all born into" assumes mainstream education/culture is programming rather than information. Claims science curricula, media, government all coordinate to teach false worldview from birth. Everyone indoctrinated to believe Earth is sphere, space is real, science is valid. Flat Earthers who "question" this supposedly breaking free from conditioning, seeing truth others miss. However, quote's logic is flawed: 1) MOCKERY DOESN'T INDICATE TRUTH: People mocked throughout history for both correct and incorrect ideas. Galileo mocked for heliocentrism (later proven correct), but alchemy, phrenology, geocentrism also mocked when they were mainstream (correctly rejected as false). Mockery indicates idea conflicts with current understanding, not that idea is true or false. Determining truth requires evidence, not tracking who's being ridiculed. Many mocked ideas remain wrong - flat Earth itself was mocked in Middle Ages by educated people who knew Earth was spherical. 2) PERSECUTION COMPLEX: Assuming mockery proves correctness is self-fulfilling prophecy. Believe Earth is flat → scientific community rejects claim with evidence → flat Earther interprets rejection as mockery proving truth → belief strengthens. Creates unfalsifiable belief system where any criticism reinforces rather than challenges belief. Psychologically protective - shields belief from examination. 3) CHERRY-PICKED HISTORICAL EXAMPLES: Conspiracy theorists cite cases where mocked individuals were later vindicated (Galileo, Copernicus, Wegener's continental drift, Semmelweis's hand-washing) to claim "they laughed at them too!" But vastly more mocked ideas remained wrong (geocentrism, flat Earth, alchemy, perpetual motion, cold fusion, etc.). Survivorship bias focuses only on rare cases of vindication, ignoring vast graveyard of debunked theories. Being mocked doesn't predict future vindication. 4) QUESTIONING VS DENYING: Genuine questioning involves examining evidence from all perspectives, updating beliefs when evidence warrants, acknowledging uncertainty. Flat Earth "questioning" means rejecting mainstream science regardless of evidence, replacing it with alternative lacking mathematical predictions or empirical support. Not questioning but denying. 5) INDOCTRINATION VS EDUCATION: Education teaches methods of inquiry (scientific method, mathematics, logic, critical thinking) and current best understanding based on evidence. Students can question, examine evidence, replicate experiments. Indoctrination teaches dogma without evidence, discourages questioning, demands acceptance on authority. Science education is opposite of indoctrination - encourages skepticism, requires reproducible results, rewards proving previous theories wrong. Scientific revolutions occur when evidence contradicts current understanding (quantum mechanics, relativity, plate tectonics). Science self-corrects; indoctrination doesn't. Quote's appeal lies in validating feelings of being misunderstood, dismissed, ridiculed. Flat Earthers often report friends/family dismissing them, losing relationships over beliefs. Instead of reconsidering whether beliefs causing social consequences might be wrong, quote reframes isolation as badge of honor. "You're mocked because you found truth they fear" is psychologically comforting explanation compared to "You're mocked because you're wrong and won't examine evidence." Dramatic landscape photography serves emotional appeal: Vast unexplored wilderness suggests undiscovered truths waiting for brave explorer. Mountain peaks represent heights of understanding reached by few. Water's calm suggests clarity, tranquility of one who knows truth. Golden light suggests enlightenment, revelation, seeing clearly what others miss. Nature's majesty implicitly aligns with flat Earth worldview - "look at this vast flat plane of water, extending to mountains on perfectly flat horizon" (ignoring that actual horizon in photo shows curvature if carefully measured and that calm water surface is not proof of flat Earth). Irony: Quote encourages "never stop questioning" but flat Earth movement doesn't question its own premise (Earth is flat). When shown evidence of curvature, satellite photos, physics proofs, movement has ready explanations dismissing all contrary evidence - CGI, conspiracy, misinterpretation, lies. Never questions whether flat Earth model itself might be wrong. Selective questioning that only challenges mainstream science while accepting flat Earth claims uncritically isn't genuine inquiry. Historical examples of genuine truth-seekers: Scientists who were mocked but ultimately vindicated earned acceptance through evidence, reproducible results, mathematical predictions confirmed by observation. Galileo's telescope observations could be replicated by anyone with telescope. Wegener's continental drift rejected until sea-floor spreading discovered providing mechanism and evidence. Semmelweis's hand-washing reduced mortality in hospitals - results were measurable. All these overcame mockery through evidence, not by insisting mockery proved their correctness. Flat Earth movement has had centuries to provide evidence, mathematical model predicting observations, physical mechanism explaining observations. Has failed to do so. Continues to be mocked not because truth-tellers are always mocked, but because claims contradict overwhelming evidence without providing better explanation. Quote's seductive message: "You're not wrong, you're ahead of your time. History will vindicate you. Keep believing despite ridicule." Psychologically powerful, epistemically bankrupt. No method for distinguishing between mocked truth-seeker who's actually correct versus mocked conspiracy theorist who's actually wrong. Quote works equally well for flat Earthers, ancient aliens theorists, moon landing deniers, any fringe belief community facing mainstream rejection. Its logic applies indiscriminately, which reveals it's not about truth but about tribal identity and resistance to mainstream culture. Alternative framing: Instead of "mockery might mean you're onto something," consider "If your theory can't predict observations, lacks mathematical framework, contradicts massive evidence base, and requires global conspiracy of millions over decades, you might want to reconsider your theory rather than assuming the entire world is wrong and you alone are right." But this framing doesn't offer psychological comfort of persecution narrative, so less popular in conspiracy communities. Landscape choice (coastal mountains) potentially significant for flat Earth context: Such scenes often used to argue "water always finds its level" therefore oceans can't curve. Calm water surface appears flat (at human scale), mountains visible across vast distance (ignoring atmospheric refraction that allows seeing beyond geometric horizon). Image selected to subconsciously reinforce flat Earth through association with seemingly flat water extending to distant mountains. Message ultimately about tribal identity: "We're the brave truth-seekers, they're the indoctrinated masses. We question, they obey. We're mocked because we're right, they mock because they're threatened." Creates in-group solidarity, out-group hostility. Transforms intellectual error into heroic narrative. Psychology of quote explains flat Earth persistence despite evidence: Belief becomes identity, criticism becomes persecution, doubt becomes betrayal, isolation becomes martyrdom. Every contrary argument strengthens rather than challenges belief. Quote encodes unfalsifiable worldview where all paths lead back to confirming flat Earth. Mockery confirms? You're right. Acceptance instead? You convinced someone of truth. Scientific evidence against flat Earth? Fake data or conspiracy. Personal experience contradicting flat Earth? Misinterpretation or optical illusion. No possible outcome could disconfirm belief, which means belief isn't based on evidence at all, but on identity, community, worldview. Quote's ultimate message: Trust your conspiracy community over scientific consensus, treasure mockery as validation, never examine your own premises, continue believing regardless of evidence. Recipe for permanence of false belief, not discovery of truth.5:T29c6,Neil deGrasse Tyson mugshot parody claiming pear-shaped Earth statement contradicts 50 years of NASA photos. Humorous meme format using police booking photo aesthetic to mock astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for scientifically accurate statement about Earth's actual shape. Image presents Tyson as "criminal" whose crime was saying truth that flat Earthers interpret as contradiction proving conspiracy. Format mimics standard police booking photographs taken during arrest processing. Background shows height measurement wall - gray horizontal lines with height markings in feet and inches visible on left side (10', 8', 6' markers visible). Creates authentic police lineup/mugshot aesthetic suggesting Tyson being arrested or processed. Subject is Neil deGrasse Tyson shown in two standard booking photo angles: LEFT SIDE shows frontal view - Tyson facing camera directly with neutral expression typical of booking photos. Face clearly recognizable - dark skin, short dark curly hair, mustache, wide-set eyes looking directly at camera with slight concern or seriousness. Wearing dark V-neck shirt or sweater showing chest hair. Shoulders squared to camera. Expression shows no emotion, following standard booking photo protocol where subjects told to maintain neutral face. RIGHT SIDE shows profile view - Tyson's head turned 90 degrees showing right side profile. Same neutral expression, mustache visible in profile, ear visible, short hair showing texture. Profile angle reveals facial structure, nose shape, jawline. Both photos appear same session with identical clothing, lighting, background. Photo quality appears grainy/low resolution typical of older institutional photography or intentionally degraded to appear more authentic to mugshot aesthetic. Black and white or desaturated color scheme enhances vintage booking photo feel. Bottom of image shows name plate typical of booking photos: White text on black background reading "NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON" in all caps, with partial number visible "12122" suggesting booking or case number. Name plate positioning matches authentic police photo format where identification information displayed below subject. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for contrast and readability. Top text reads: "SAID THE EARTH IS PEAR SHAPED" in all caps describing Tyson's "crime" - stating scientific fact about Earth's actual shape. Bottom text reads: "FORGOT ABOUT 50 YEARS OF FAKE NASA PHOTOS" in all caps suggesting Tyson's error was contradicting supposed consistency of faked NASA imagery by revealing Earth isn't perfect sphere. Center of image shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in gray text. Meme's argument operates on several misconceptions: 1) PEAR-SHAPED EARTH STATEMENT: Neil deGrasse Tyson has accurately stated Earth is not perfect sphere but oblate spheroid - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation. More precisely, Earth is very slightly pear-shaped with southern hemisphere marginally larger than northern hemisphere by tiny amount (difference of ~30 feet in 8,000 mile diameter - 0.0004% variation). This is measurable scientific fact confirmed by satellite geodesy, gravitational measurements, precise surveying. Tyson's statement reflects current scientific understanding of Earth's actual shape. 2) PERCEIVED CONTRADICTION: Flat Earthers interpret "pear-shaped" statement as contradiction of NASA photos showing Earth as sphere. Argument suggests: If Earth truly spherical as NASA photos show for 50+ years, why does Tyson now say it's pear-shaped? Must be lying about something - either old photos are fake (showing perfect sphere when Earth is actually pear) or Tyson is wrong now. Flat Earthers choose interpretation that old photos are fake, proving NASA has been lying for decades. 3) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Earth's pear-shape variation is so minuscule it's imperceptible in photographs. At 0.0004% variation, difference between perfect sphere and Earth's actual shape is invisible to human eye at planetary scale. Like describing perfectly round basketball that's 0.0004% asymmetrical - you'd never notice unless measuring with precision instruments. NASA photos correctly show Earth appearing spherical because at photographic resolution, the tiny pear-shaped variation is far below visible threshold. Photos are accurate representations of what Earth looks like - spherical with imperceptible asymmetry. 4) SCIENTIFIC PRECISION VS VISUAL APPEARANCE: Science requires precision beyond visual observation. Saying Earth is spherical is correct for general purposes - planet is round, not flat. Saying Earth is oblate spheroid is more precise - round but slightly flattened. Saying Earth is pear-shaped oblate spheroid is even more precise - accounts for southern hemisphere's tiny extra bulge. Each statement is true at different precision levels. Analogous to describing someone's height: "about 6 feet" vs "6 feet 1/4 inch" vs "6 feet 0.237 inches" - all correct, increasing precision. Visual photos show "round" which is accurate at visible scale. Precise measurements show "pear-shaped" which is accurate at measurement precision. No contradiction. 5) "FAKE NASA PHOTOS" CLAIM: Meme suggests NASA photos are fabricated because they don't show pear shape. But photos DO show Earth's actual shape accurately - at photographic resolution, Earth appears spherical because pear-shaped variation is submicroscopic relative to planet size. If NASA were faking photos, they wouldn't bother making them show perfect sphere - they'd include accurate oblate spheroid shape and tiny pear asymmetry in renderings to match known measurements. Fact that photos show apparently perfect sphere actually confirms they're real photographs, not CGI optimized to match measurements. Real photographs show what human eyes would see - round planet. CGI would show mathematically perfect shape including all measured asymmetries. MUGSHOT FORMAT creates humorous suggestion that stating scientific truth is criminal offense. Implies Tyson "caught" in contradiction, being arrested for exposing NASA lies. But mugshot is photoshopped composite - Tyson never actually arrested, images are edited to create booking photo appearance. Format serves to mock and discredit Tyson rather than engage with scientific accuracy of his statements. Neil deGrasse Tyson frequently targeted by flat Earth movement because: As prominent science communicator and astrophysicist, he represents mainstream scientific establishment that flat Earthers oppose. His media presence (hosted Cosmos reboot, frequent TV appearances, social media following) makes him highly visible advocate for scientific consensus. His confident, sometimes condescending communication style can be polarizing, making him target for ridicule. He's defended spherical Earth, space exploration, NASA against conspiracy theories, making him enemy of flat Earth movement. His statements about Earth's precise shape give flat Earthers perceived ammunition for "gotcha" contradictions. Historical context of Earth's shape understanding: Ancient Greeks knew Earth was spherical (Eratosthenes measured circumference 240 BCE using shadows). Newton predicted oblate spheroid shape due to rotation (1687). Precise measurements confirmed oblate spheroid with polar flattening (equatorial diameter ~27 miles larger than polar diameter). Modern satellite geodesy revealed tiny pear-shaped asymmetry (southern hemisphere slightly larger than northern by ~30 feet). Each advance in precision refined understanding without contradicting previous knowledge - Earth is round, more precisely oblate spheroid, even more precisely pear-shaped oblate spheroid. All statements correct at respective precision levels. Photos from space confirmed visual appearance matches scientific models. Meme's "50 years of fake NASA photos" references period from 1960s (early space age) to present. Suggests consistent imagery over decades is evidence of fabrication rather than evidence of authenticity. But consistency over 50+ years across multiple nations, agencies, private companies, with geography matching ground-based maps, weather patterns matching meteorological data, and visible features consistent over time actually proves authenticity. Maintaining fake consistency would be far harder than taking real photos. Joke in meme works through false dichotomy: Either NASA photos show perfect sphere (and are therefore fake because Earth is actually pear-shaped), or Tyson is wrong about pear shape. Ignores third option that both are correct - Earth appears spherical in photos because pear asymmetry is imperceptible at visible scale, while precise measurements reveal tiny pear shape invisible in photographs. Format also contains irony: Using criminal mugshot to mock scientist for stating accurate scientific fact reflects anti-intellectual strain in conspiracy movements where education and expertise seen as crimes rather than virtues. Scientist "arrested" for truth-telling inverts reality where conspiracy theorists see themselves as truth-tellers persecuted by establishment. Tyson becomes avatar for scientific establishment that flat Earthers believe is lying. Effectiveness comes from: Accessible format (mugshot is universally recognized), humor (absurdity of arresting scientist for scientific statement), perceived contradiction (pear vs sphere), and confirmation bias (those predisposed to distrust NASA see this as evidence of lies). Weakness: Anyone understanding scale and precision recognizes no contradiction exists. Pear-shaped variation of 0.0004% is invisible in photos, so photos accurately show apparent sphere while measurements reveal imperceptible asymmetry. Both Tyson's statement and NASA photos are correct. Meme also serves flat Earth community function: Provides quick dismissal of Tyson's credibility. When Tyson cited as authority on Earth's shape, flat Earthers can reference this meme - "he said pear-shaped contradicting NASA, so he's unreliable" - without engaging with actual science. Creates perception of inconsistency in scientific community when no real inconsistency exists. Bottom line: Meme misrepresents both Tyson's statement (which is scientifically accurate) and NASA photos (which are authentic representations of Earth's appearance). Creates false contradiction by conflating visible appearance with measured asymmetry at sub-visual precision level. Uses humor and mugshot format to discredit science communicator rather than examining evidence. Assumes audience won't understand scale of asymmetry (0.0004%) or relationship between photographic representation and measurement precision.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-372","title":"Other 372","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12888573_481794215353651_2206778297078522435_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-371","title":"Other 371","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12885892_477547669111639_1335850084942096854_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-373","title":"Other 373","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12888609_478138159052590_5504841435232940583_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
