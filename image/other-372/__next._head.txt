5:T368e,Absurdist meme of cowboy riding missile-straddling dinosaur shooting shark with text mocking NASA photo authentication. Surreal photoshopped composite image creating impossible scenario to satirize claims that any NASA photograph must be authentic. Image uses deliberately ridiculous, obviously fake composition to mock argument "If photo is on NASA website, it must be real." Meme operates through reductio ad absurdum - if NASA presence validates any image regardless of content, then even absurd impossible image should be believed if NASA hosted it. Central figure is Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur in brown/green coloration with typical T-Rex features - massive head with enormous jaws full of sharp teeth, tiny forearms, powerful hind legs, thick tail extending behind. Dinosaur appears in aggressive posture with mouth open showing teeth, suggesting attacking or roaring. Dinosaur rendered in semi-realistic style (possibly from documentary or film CGI, or photoshopped from museum skeleton/model). Mounted ON TOP of dinosaur's back is human figure wearing cowboy outfit - appears to be man in Western attire with cowboy hat, possibly jeans/shirt typical of Wild West imagery. Cowboy sits astride T-Rex like riding horse, in action pose suggesting rodeo or cavalry charge. Cowboy holds weapon aimed forward - appears to be rifle or similar firearm. Pose suggests Old West gunfighter or cavalry soldier, transplanted into context of riding dinosaur into battle. Beneath/between dinosaur's legs is SHARK suspended in mid-air - appears to be great white shark based on size, coloration (gray back, white underside), dorsal fin. Shark positioned horizontally in swimming pose but floating impossibly in air beneath dinosaur without water or support. Shark's mouth open showing rows of sharp teeth. Shark scale seems roughly proportional to dinosaur size, creating bizarre menagerie of predators from different eras/environments impossibly combined. Most absurd element: MISSILE or ROCKET positioned between dinosaur and shark. Large military-style missile appears horizontally oriented, gray/silver metal surface with tail fins, pointed nose cone, exhaust trail suggesting propulsion. Missile positioned as if dinosaur is straddling it while rocket fires - imagine rodeo rider on bull, but bull is dinosaur-missile hybrid. Cowboy appears to be RIDING this dinosaur-missile contraption while SHOOTING at shark. Entire composition violates physics, biology, chronology, basic reality. Background appears to be outdoor sky - light blue color with some cloud texture suggesting this scene supposedly occurring in Earth's atmosphere. Ground may be partially visible at bottom suggesting scene near surface. Overall lighting suggests daytime, though shadows inconsistent (common in amateur Photoshop composites). Image quality varies across elements suggesting different source materials composited together - some elements sharp, others blurrier, lighting directions inconsistent, scale relationships questionable. Obviously amateur Photoshop work, intentionally bad composition for comedic effect. Text overlays in white sans-serif font with black outlines for contrast and readability. Top text in large letters reads: "IT WAS ON THE NASA WEBSITE" in all caps emphasizing supposed authority of NASA hosting. Bottom text continues: "SO IT MUST BE REAL" completing sarcastic argument - if NASA website hosts image, image must be authentic photograph of real event. Lower right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Meme satirizes flat Earth community's selective skepticism: 1) MOCKING NASA TRUST: Flat Earthers accuse others of blindly trusting NASA photos of space, Earth from orbit, satellites, astronauts. Argument suggests "globe believers" automatically accept any NASA image as real without critical examination. Meme exaggerates this to absurdity - would you believe cowboys rode missiles on dinosaurs hunting sharks in midair just because image appeared on NASA website? Obviously not. Therefore, implies we shouldn't automatically trust NASA's actual space photography either. 2) REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM: Logical technique of taking opponent's principle to extreme conclusion to show principle is flawed. If "NASA website = proof of authenticity" were valid principle, then this impossible image would be real if NASA posted it. Since that's ridiculous, principle must be wrong. Therefore, NASA's actual space photos might also be fake despite NASA hosting them. 3) PHOTOSHOP ACCUSATIONS: Flat Earth movement frequently accuses NASA of photoshopping Earth images - claims clouds copied/pasted, composites from multiple photos, size of continents changes between images, colors unrealistic. When NASA explains images are composites (necessarily true for whole-Earth views because satellites orbit and Earth rotates - must stitch together images from different times/angles to create full globe view), flat Earthers cite this as admission of fakery. Meme's obvious photoshop (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) is meant to look like NASA's supposed photoshop of space images. 4) APPEAL TO ABSURDITY: By creating maximally absurd scenario (combining predators from land/sea/extinct eras, adding Western cowboy, throwing in missile for extra impossibility, having shark fly without water), meme generates immediate gut response: "This is obviously fake!" Meme then trains that skeptical response onto NASA's legitimate photos: "See how easily fake images can be made? NASA photos could be just as fake, just less obviously." However, meme's logic is flawed: 1) NOBODY CLAIMS NASA HOSTING PROVES AUTHENTICITY: Globe Earth believers don't accept space photos merely because NASA posted them. Photos are accepted because: Multiple space agencies from competing nations (USA/NASA, Russia/Roscosmos, ESA, China/CNSA, India/ISRO, Japan/JAXA, etc.) independently produce similar images of spherical Earth. Private companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Planet Labs, etc.) produce similar images. All consistent with spherical Earth, inconsistent with flat Earth. Images show consistent geography, weather patterns, seasonal changes over decades - impossible to maintain fake consistency across thousands of images from hundreds of missions over 60+ years. Amateur astronomers can photograph satellites in orbit, track ISS, observe objects matching official positions. Photo metadata (EXIF data, spectral analysis, lighting angles) consistent with claimed origins. Physics of optics, orbital mechanics predict exactly what cameras in orbit should see - predictions match photographs. Independent verification from non-governmental sources. Trust isn't blind faith in NASA, but confidence built on multiple independent confirmations. 2) OBVIOUS FAKE VS SOPHISTICATED COMPOSITE: Meme's image is obviously impossible - combines entities that can't coexist (dinosaurs extinct 65 million years ago, sharks need water, missiles didn't exist in dinosaur era, humans came after dinosaurs). Poor photoshop execution (lighting mismatches, scale inconsistencies, unnatural positioning). NASA's images show Earth/space scenes that are physically possible and consistent with physics. Compositing multiple orbital photos into single Earth view is technically necessary and clearly explained, different from fabricating impossible scene. 3) VERIFIABLE VS UNVERIFIABLE: NASA photos can be verified independently through: Launching your own satellite (amateur cubesats do this), high-altitude balloon photography showing curvature, replicating observations (astronauts see Earth rotate, matching rotation rate measured from ground), checking consistency (Earth's geography matches maps derived from ground survey, ship/plane navigation over centuries). Cowboy-dinosaur-shark image can't be verified because scenario never occurred and is physically impossible. 4) STRAWMAN ARGUMENT: Meme attacks argument nobody makes. Scientists/educators don't say "trust NASA because they're NASA." They say "NASA's findings match independent verification, follow from physics, predict observations, and are replicated by other agencies. Therefore NASA's data is reliable." That's evidence-based trust, not blind faith. Meme's effectiveness comes from humor and simplicity: Absurd image is memorable, creates strong emotional response (laughter at absurdity), makes complex issue (how do we verify remote observations?) seem simple ("obviously this is fake, so maybe NASA stuff is too"). Humor bypasses analytical thinking. Meme format allows quick sharing of concept without need for lengthy explanation. Image sticks in memory because of bizarre combination. But meme's logic falls apart under examination: Just because some images are fake doesn't mean all images are fake. Just because Photoshop exists doesn't mean every photo is photoshopped. World would be chaos if we couldn't distinguish between obvious composites (cowboy-dinosaur-missile-shark) and legitimate photography (Earth from space). We successfully make these distinctions constantly - nobody files insurance claims showing alien abduction photos as evidence, courts don't accept photoshopped images as proof, journalists verify photos before publication. Sophisticated methods exist for detecting photo manipulation (forensic analysis of compression artifacts, lighting consistency, metadata examination, shadow angle verification). NASA photos pass these tests. Cowboys-on-dinosaurs photo would immediately fail. Irony: Flat Earthers make this meme while simultaneously asking others to trust their photos/videos as proof of flat Earth - videos of horizon looking flat, ships not disappearing, sun rays through clouds "proving" sun is close, etc. Same skepticism applied to flat Earth evidence would reveal issues: atmospheric refraction, insufficient altitude to see curvature, misunderstanding of perspective, misapplication of geometry. But flat Earthers don't apply critical analysis to their own side's images, only to NASA's. This selective skepticism reveals motivated reasoning - reject evidence contradicting flat Earth regardless of quality, accept evidence supporting flat Earth regardless of flaws. Dinosaur inclusion possibly references young Earth creationism's overlap with flat Earth movement (both reject scientific consensus about Earth, age, evolution). Some flat Earth supporters also believe dinosaurs coexisted with humans based on literal Bible interpretation, making cowboy-riding-dinosaur less absurd in their worldview than intended. Most Americans recognize dinosaurs extinct millions of years before humans, making image obviously impossible. But for young Earth creationists who believe Earth is 6,000-10,000 years old and all animals created simultaneously, humans and dinosaurs might have coexisted. This theological overlap between flat Earth and young Earth creationism suggests image working on multiple levels. Missile/rocket element particularly relevant: Flat Earthers question whether rockets work in vacuum, whether space travel possible, whether missiles follow claimed trajectories. Including missile in absurd composite associates real rocket technology with impossible fantasy scenario. Shark adds aquatic element - flat Earthers often discuss ocean navigation, ships' visibility over water, water's level surface as proof of flat Earth. Shark out of water is impossible, just as they claim satellites in orbit are impossible ("sharks need water to survive, satellites need air to push against" - both statements revealing misunderstanding of respective mediums and physics). Cowboy represents Western American frontier mythology - self-reliant individual who questions authority, trusts personal experience over expert testimony, values common sense over book learning. Archetype flat Earth movement identifies with: modern cowboys questioning scientific establishment, relying on own observations ("I don't see curvature, so Earth must be flat" parallels "I know what I saw" cowboy empiricism). Composite's absurdity is intentional - meant to be shared, laughed at, remembered. Serves as thought-terminating cliche: Instead of examining NASA's evidence, verification methods, independent confirmations, just think of cowboy-dinosaur meme and dismiss all space photography as potentially fake. Reduces complex epistemological question (how do we verify remote observations?) to simple meme-based skepticism. Effectiveness for flat Earth movement: Provides quick, memorable response to space photos. When shown ISS photo of Earth, flat Earther can respond "It's on NASA website so must be real, right?" with knowing sarcasm referencing this meme. Allows dismissal of evidence without engagement. Creates false equivalence between provable photos and absurdist fantasy. But false equivalence is propaganda technique, not logical argument. Real question isn't "Can photos be faked?" (answer: yes) but "Are NASA's specific photos fake?" (answer: no, verified through multiple independent sources). Meme confuses these questions. Ultimate message: Don't trust institutional sources (NASA, government, science agencies), trust only your own observations and alternative community (flat Earth). But human observations are limited - can't see entire Earth at once, can't see far enough to detect curvature without altitude, can't directly sense Earth's rotation, can't visit space without technology. Must rely on instruments, photographs, others' reports to understand phenomena beyond direct experience. Question becomes: Which sources trustworthy? Scientific consensus with peer review, replication, mathematical predictions, multi-national verification? Or YouTube videos and Facebook memes from people with no relevant expertise? Meme answers: Official sources untrustworthy, alternatives more reliable. But provides no method for distinguishing true alternative sources from false ones, creating epistemic chaos where anything can be believed or rejected based on tribal affiliation rather than evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 372 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Absurdist meme of cowboy riding missile-straddling dinosaur shooting shark with text mocking NASA photo authentication.
