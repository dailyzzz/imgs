5:T601,Gravitron carnival ride demonstrating centrifugal force opposite of gravity. Shows carnival amusement park ride in action. Large circular spinning ride called Gravitron with distinctive UFO/flying saucer appearance - silver-gray metallic dome with light blue accents and red trim bands. Decorative lights create retro sci-fi aesthetic. Top displays arched red sign reading 'GRAVITRON' in illuminated letters. Structure supported by yellow metal framework and safety barriers. Below, riders pressed against padded walls inside spinning chamber - centrifugal force pins them to perimeter as floor drops away. Visible riders wearing winter clothing (jackets, hoodies) stuck to red padded sections. One person in striped clothing, others in solid colors. Crowd visible at ground level watching. Background shows light blue evening sky with power lines. Middle text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE FASTER IT SPINS, THE MORE YOU STICK TO THE WALL'. Bottom text: 'PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW GRAVITY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK'. Bottom right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph at equator, centrifugal force should fling objects outward away from surface, opposite of gravitational attraction pulling inward. However, Earth's rotation creates minimal centrifugal force compared to gravity due to large radius. At equator, centrifugal acceleration is only 0.03 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s². Gravitron spins much faster in tight radius creating noticeable outward force0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 241 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Gravitron carnival ride demonstrating centrifugal force opposite of gravity.
