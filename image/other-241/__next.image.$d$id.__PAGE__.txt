3:T601,Gravitron carnival ride demonstrating centrifugal force opposite of gravity. Shows carnival amusement park ride in action. Large circular spinning ride called Gravitron with distinctive UFO/flying saucer appearance - silver-gray metallic dome with light blue accents and red trim bands. Decorative lights create retro sci-fi aesthetic. Top displays arched red sign reading 'GRAVITRON' in illuminated letters. Structure supported by yellow metal framework and safety barriers. Below, riders pressed against padded walls inside spinning chamber - centrifugal force pins them to perimeter as floor drops away. Visible riders wearing winter clothing (jackets, hoodies) stuck to red padded sections. One person in striped clothing, others in solid colors. Crowd visible at ground level watching. Background shows light blue evening sky with power lines. Middle text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE FASTER IT SPINS, THE MORE YOU STICK TO THE WALL'. Bottom text: 'PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW GRAVITY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK'. Bottom right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph at equator, centrifugal force should fling objects outward away from surface, opposite of gravitational attraction pulling inward. However, Earth's rotation creates minimal centrifugal force compared to gravity due to large radius. At equator, centrifugal acceleration is only 0.03 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s². Gravitron spins much faster in tight radius creating noticeable outward force4:T629,Historical text excerpt claiming globe Earth as recent innovation. Shows photograph of aged printed page with tan-beige paper showing brown staining, wear, and aging. Text appears in traditional serif typeface suggesting old book or document. Visible header reads 'preparation for' followed by 'THE GLOBES' as section title. Main paragraph text states: 'A short time ago one of the Brethren questioned the adaptation of the balls to use for globes representing the terrestrial and celestial firmaments. He pointed out that it is only a matter of a few hundred years since everyone believed that the earth was flat! This is quite true, and this idea is quite a modern innovation. Except to a few profound thinkers such as Plato, the conception of the earth as a sphere was utterly foreign.' Gray watermark across text reads 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Text appears to be from religious or educational publication discussing history of cosmological models. Passage acknowledges flat Earth was universal belief until recently (few hundred years ago), then claims spherical Earth concept is 'modern innovation'. States only rare philosophers like Plato conceived of spherical Earth, implying it was alien to common understanding. Flat Earth proponents share this to argue globe model is recent invention rather than ancient knowledge. However, spherical Earth was established by ancient Greeks around 500 BCE, with Eratosthenes calculating circumference in 240 BCE. Medieval scholars also accepted spherical Earth. Passage reflects common misconception about flat Earth belief in history5:T5d3,Pythagorean theorem diagram calculating Earth curvature at 3,959 mile radius. Shows technical geometric illustration proving curvature calculation using AutoCAD 2015. Title at top: 'PYTHAGOREAN PROOF OF CURVATURE FOR A BALL WITH A RADIUS OF 3959 MILES (USING AutoCAD 2015 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Main diagram displays cross-section of Earth as circle with 3,959 mile radius marked. Faint background shows actual Earth photograph with clouds and blue oceans. Geometric lines and angles drawn showing Pythagorean right triangles formed between Earth's center, surface points at various distances. Left side lists 'MILES IN: THOUSANDS' with measurements from 0 to 5000 miles. Diagram shows sight lines from observer at surface extending tangent to horizon. Right side contains detailed data table with columns: 'Miles', 'Feet', 'Inches', 'Miles' showing calculated drop at various distances using Earth's curvature formula. Formula shown: '8 inches per mile squared'. Bottom sections show magnified views at '10X MAGNIFICATION' and '100X MAGNIFICATION' to demonstrate geometric precision. Yellow highlighted box displays 'EXCEL FORMULA: X=3959-(3959*(COS(ASIN(L/3959))))' for calculating drop. Credit shows 'SPACE TRIG DRAWING BY MKAING 01/26/15'. Standard calculation used by surveyors and engineers to account for Earth's curvature in long-distance measurements. Flat Earthers use this to test visibility - if landmarks remain visible beyond calculated drop, they claim no curvature exists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-241","title":"Other 241","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687911_460794420786964_5550253741581559752_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-240","title":"Other 240","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671813_467779710088435_4298974868270770621_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-242","title":"Other 242","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687931_463064537226619_4125492635927836346_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
