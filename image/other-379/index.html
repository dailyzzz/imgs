Two-panel photograph of antique publication demonstrating flat Earth beliefs existed in modern era, used by contemporary movement to show historical precedent for their beliefs. Image presents early 20th century flat Earth literature as evidence that questioning globe Earth has legitimate intellectual tradition. LEFT PANEL - BOOK COVER: Shows front cover of bound book in aged condition. Paper appears yellowed/cream colored typical of century-old publication. Cover shows signs of age - slight foxing (brown spots), wear at edges, fading. Design is typical early 1900s American publishing style - decorative but restrained. AMERICAN FLAG ILLUSTRATION: Upper portion of cover features waving American flag in full color (or appears to be - reds, blues visible). Flag shown on pole with decorative finial. Stars and stripes clearly depicted. Flag association with flat Earth book suggests author framing flat Earth belief as American/patriotic cause. TITLE TEXT: Below flag, &quot;SECOND EDITION&quot; in small capitals indicates book was successful enough to warrant reprinting. Main title &quot;THE ENLIGHTENMENT of THE WORLD&quot; in large serif font with decorative styling. Word &quot;of&quot; in smaller italic script connecting two title elements. &quot;THE WORLD&quot; positioned below with decorative underline/rule. AUTHOR: &quot;By JOHN G. ABIZAID&quot; in uppercase letters below title. John G. Abizaid was early 20th century flat Earth advocate, one of several authors publishing flat Earth arguments during this period. SUBTITLE/DESCRIPTION: Below author name, text reads: &quot;This book contains proof that the earth is flat and stationary, while the sun, moon and stars are in constant motion.&quot; This summarizes flat Earth geocentric model - stationary flat Earth with celestial bodies moving above/around it. Continues: &quot;Also letters showing the testimony of Scripture on the subject.&quot; Indicates religious/biblical arguments included, common in flat Earth literature combining pseudo-science with scriptural interpretation. DATE: &quot;1912&quot; at bottom establishing publication year - over 110 years ago, well into era when spherical Earth was established scientific fact (known since ancient Greece, confirmed by global navigation, photography, etc.). RIGHT PANEL - INTERIOR PAGE: Shows page 7 of book, beginning of Chapter 1. Page appears cream/off-white with clear black printed text in serif typeface typical of era. CHAPTER HEADING: &quot;CHAPTER I.&quot; centered at top in capitals. Below, &quot;THE WATER.&quot; as chapter title - first &quot;proof&quot; presented in book. TEXT CONTENT (full transcription): &quot;You know that there is more water on the earth than dry land. Here is the first proof: The water proves that the earth is flat, level and stationary. Water is liquid. It runs always down and seeks its level, and never runs up unless by power. And the water of the ocean is every way pretty near joined together on the earth, and they call it liquid. It will not stay on a round earth. Take a glass of water and pour it on a round ball and if the water stays on, then the earth must be round, but if the water falls off then the earth must be flat. This is the proof: Take a pan and fill it with water and see if it is higher in the center than on the sides. If this is true, then the water of the ocean might be round, but if the water in the pan is flat and level, then the water of the ocean must also be flat and level. The water of the ocean is level and can be nothing else, because it is liquid, which proves that the land is flat and not round. The land is not exactly flat and level, for there are mountains and valleys. But it makes no difference, for if the mountains were in the valleys it would leave the land flat and level and higher than the water. I have been thinking of the question for a long time. At last I have found out for myself from the water and the sunbeams, the sun&#x27;s rising, the sunlight, etc., that the earth cannot be round and in motion, as books and teachers have taught. The teachers offer proofs to show that the earth is round, but the proofs they offer amount to nothing. When the children go to school, the teacher tells them the world is round, and, of course, they believe it, and they do not ask how it is round. They are young and they know very little. When they grow up they still believe the earth is round and in motion, and so in turn they teach this to others. The water is flat, which proves that the earth is flat and stationary. From its fruit you will know what kind of a tree it is.&quot; WATER ARGUMENT ANALYSIS: Abizaid&#x27;s argument represents classic flat Earth reasoning still used today: 1) &quot;Water seeks its level&quot; - True for small scales where gravity pulls water to lowest point in container. 2) &quot;Water won&#x27;t stay on round ball&quot; - Misunderstands gravity. Gravity pulls toward center of mass, not &quot;down&quot; in absolute direction. On sphere, gravity pulls water toward center, holding it on surface regardless of position. 3) &quot;Pan test&quot; - Compares small container (where surface tension and small scale make water appear flat) to ocean (where Earth&#x27;s gravity holds water to spherical surface). Scale difference makes comparison invalid. 4) &quot;Ocean is level&quot; - &quot;Level&quot; in physics means perpendicular to gravity vector, not geometrically flat. Ocean IS level - perpendicular to gravity at every point - but this means following Earth&#x27;s curved surface, not being flat plane. SCIENTIFIC REBUTTAL: 1) GRAVITY: Water stays on spherical Earth because gravity pulls toward Earth&#x27;s center. &quot;Down&quot; is always toward center, not absolute direction. Water on ball falls off because ball&#x27;s mass is too small for significant gravity - not because round things can&#x27;t hold water. Earth&#x27;s gravity holds oceans firmly to surface regardless of location. 2) SCALE: At ocean scale, water DOES follow Earth&#x27;s curvature - that&#x27;s why ships disappear hull-first over horizon, why lighthouses have limited range, why sea-level varies with latitude (bulge at equator from rotation). Curvature too gradual to see in pan of water, but measurable over distances. 3) &quot;LEVEL&quot; DEFINITION: Surveyors and engineers understand &quot;level&quot; means perpendicular to gravity, not geometrically flat. Large construction projects (bridges, tunnels, railways) must account for Earth&#x27;s curvature - proves spherical Earth assumed and verified in civil engineering. 4) OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE: Ships disappearing bottom-first, time zones existing, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, photos from space - all confirm spherical Earth, contradict flat Earth water argument. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: 1912 was not period of scientific ignorance - spherical Earth known for over 2,000 years, confirmed by centuries of global navigation, established in all scientific education. Flat Earth belief in 1912 was fringe position held by small group contradicting overwhelming scientific consensus. Abizaid&#x27;s book represents pseudo-scientific contrarianism, not legitimate scientific debate. RELIGIOUS COMPONENT: Reference to &quot;testimony of Scripture&quot; indicates flat Earth arguments often combined with biblical literalism - interpreting verses about &quot;four corners of earth,&quot; &quot;circle of earth,&quot; &quot;firmament&quot; as proof of flat cosmology. This tradition continues in modern flat Earth movement where religious belief often accompanies pseudo-scientific arguments. PURPOSE OF IMAGE: Showing 1912 flat Earth book serves modern flat Earth community by: 1) Demonstrating historical precedent - &quot;people have questioned globe Earth for centuries&quot; 2) Providing &quot;intellectual&quot; source material - book format suggests scholarly work 3) Connecting to American patriotism (flag imagery) 4) Linking to religious tradition (Scripture reference) 5) Showing arguments haven&#x27;t changed - same &quot;water is level&quot; reasoning used today However, historical existence of flat Earth books proves only that some people held incorrect beliefs - not that beliefs were correct. Phrenology, alchemy, miasma theory also had books and adherents; existence doesn&#x27;t validate. Attribution &quot;fb.com/fematters&quot; indicates modern flat Earth community sharing historical material to support contemporary conspiracy theory. Book is genuine historical artifact; interpretation placing it in legitimate scientific tradition is misleading."/><meta property="og:type" content="article"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Other 379"/><meta name="twitter:description" content="Historical 1912 flat Earth book &quot;The Enlightenment of the World&quot; by John G.

Image presents early 20th century flat Earth literature as evidence that questioning globe Earth has legitimate intellectual tradition. LEFT PANEL - BOOK COVER: Shows front cover of bound book in aged condition. Paper appears yellowed/cream colored typical of century-old publication. Cover shows signs of age - slight foxing (brown spots), wear at edges, fading. Design is typical early 1900s American publishing style - decorative but restrained. AMERICAN FLAG ILLUSTRATION: Upper portion of cover features waving American flag in full color (or appears to be - reds, blues visible). Flag shown on pole with decorative finial. Stars and stripes clearly depicted. Flag association with flat Earth book suggests author framing flat Earth belief as American/patriotic cause.

Main title \"THE ENLIGHTENMENT of THE WORLD\" in large serif font with decorative styling. Word \"of\" in smaller italic script connecting two title elements. \"THE WORLD\" positioned below with decorative underline/rule. AUTHOR: \"By JOHN G. ABIZAID\" in uppercase letters below title. John G. Abizaid was early 20th century flat Earth advocate, one of several authors publishing flat Earth arguments during this period. SUBTITLE/DESCRIPTION: Below author name, text reads: \"This book contains proof that the earth is flat and stationary, while the sun, moon and stars are in constant motion.\" This summarizes flat Earth geocentric model - stationary flat Earth with celestial bodies moving above/around it. Continues: \"Also letters showing the testimony of Scripture on the subject.\" Indicates religious/biblical arguments included, common in flat Earth literature combining pseudo-science with scriptural interpretation. DATE: \"1912\" at bottom establishing publication year - over 110 years ago, well into era when spherical Earth was established scientific fact (known since ancient Greece, confirmed by global navigation, photography, etc.). RIGHT PANEL - INTERIOR PAGE: Shows page 7 of book, beginning of Chapter 1. Page appears cream/off-white with clear black printed text in serif typeface typical of era. CHAPTER HEADING: \"CHAPTER I.\" centered at top in capitals. Below, \"THE WATER.\" as chapter title - first \"proof\" presented in book. TEXT CONTENT (full transcription): \"You know that there is more water on the earth than dry land. Here is the first proof: The water proves that the earth is flat, level and stationary. Water is liquid. It runs always down and seeks its level, and never runs up unless by power. And the water of the ocean is every way pretty near joined together on the earth, and they call it liquid. It will not stay on a round earth. Take a glass of water and pour it on a round ball and if the water stays on, then the earth must be round, but if the water falls off then the earth must be flat. This is the proof: Take a pan and fill it with water and see if it is higher in the center than on the sides. If this is true, then the water of the ocean might be round, but if the water in the pan is flat and level, then the water of the ocean must also be flat and level. The water of the ocean is level and can be nothing else, because it is liquid, which proves that the land is flat and not round. The land is not exactly flat and level, for there are mountains and valleys. But it makes no difference, for if the mountains were in the valleys it would leave the land flat and level and higher than the water. I have been thinking of the question for a long time. At last I have found out for myself from the water and the sunbeams, the sun's rising, the sunlight, etc., that the earth cannot be round and in motion, as books and teachers have taught. The teachers offer proofs to show that the earth is round, but the proofs they offer amount to nothing. When the children go to school, the teacher tells them the world is round, and, of course, they believe it, and they do not ask how it is round. They are young and they know very little. When they grow up they still believe the earth is round and in motion, and so in turn they teach this to others. The water is flat, which proves that the earth is flat and stationary. From its fruit you will know what kind of a tree it is.\" WATER ARGUMENT ANALYSIS: Abizaid's argument represents classic flat Earth reasoning still used today: 1) \"Water seeks its level\" - True for small scales where gravity pulls water to lowest point in container. 2) \"Water won't stay on round ball\" - Misunderstands gravity. Gravity pulls toward center of mass, not \"down\" in absolute direction. On sphere, gravity pulls water toward center, holding it on surface regardless of position. 3) \"Pan test\" - Compares small container (where surface tension and small scale make water appear flat) to ocean (where Earth's gravity holds water to spherical surface). Scale difference makes comparison invalid. 4) \"Ocean is level\" - \"Level\" in physics means perpendicular to gravity vector, not geometrically flat. Ocean IS level - perpendicular to gravity at every point - but this means following Earth's curved surface, not being flat plane. SCIENTIFIC REBUTTAL: 1) GRAVITY: Water stays on spherical Earth because gravity pulls toward Earth's center. \"Down\" is always toward center, not absolute direction. Water on ball falls off because ball's mass is too small for significant gravity - not because round things can't hold water. Earth's gravity holds oceans firmly to surface regardless of location. 2) SCALE: At ocean scale, water DOES follow Earth's curvature - that's why ships disappear hull-first over horizon, why lighthouses have limited range, why sea-level varies with latitude (bulge at equator from rotation). Curvature too gradual to see in pan of water, but measurable over distances. 3) \"LEVEL\" DEFINITION: Surveyors and engineers understand \"level\" means perpendicular to gravity, not geometrically flat. Large construction projects (bridges, tunnels, railways) must account for Earth's curvature - proves spherical Earth assumed and verified in civil engineering. 4) OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE: Ships disappearing bottom-first, time zones existing, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, photos from space - all confirm spherical Earth, contradict flat Earth water argument. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: 1912 was not period of scientific ignorance - spherical Earth known for over 2,000 years, confirmed by centuries of global navigation, established in all scientific education. Flat Earth belief in 1912 was fringe position held by small group contradicting overwhelming scientific consensus. Abizaid's book represents pseudo-scientific contrarianism, not legitimate scientific debate. RELIGIOUS COMPONENT: Reference to \"testimony of Scripture\" indicates flat Earth arguments often combined with biblical literalism - interpreting verses about \"four corners of earth,\" \"circle of earth,\" \"firmament\" as proof of flat cosmology. This tradition continues in modern flat Earth movement where religious belief often accompanies pseudo-scientific arguments. PURPOSE OF IMAGE: Showing 1912 flat Earth book serves modern flat Earth community by: 1) Demonstrating historical precedent - \"people have questioned globe Earth for centuries\" 2) Providing \"intellectual\" source material - book format suggests scholarly work 3) Connecting to American patriotism (flag imagery) 4) Linking to religious tradition (Scripture reference) 5) Showing arguments haven't changed - same \"water is level\" reasoning used today However, historical existence of flat Earth books proves only that some people held incorrect beliefs - not that beliefs were correct. Phrenology, alchemy, miasma theory also had books and adherents; existence doesn't validate. Attribution \"fb.com/fematters\" indicates modern flat Earth community sharing historical material to support contemporary conspiracy theory. Book is genuine historical artifact; interpretation placing it in legitimate scientific tradition is misleading."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T21b6,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Aerial view of Mount Fuji from airplane mocking \"not high enough to see curvature\" argument with flat horizon visible. Stunning high-altitude photograph of snow-capped volcano rising above cloud layer, presented sarcastically to mock claims that commercial airplane altitude is insufficient to observe Earth's curvature. Image demonstrates flat Earth argument that horizon appears flat even at cruising altitude, challenging globe Earth model. Photograph taken from commercial aircraft window showing spectacular aerial view. Image quality suggests smartphone or consumer camera capturing moment during flight. Slight vignetting and color cast around edges typical of photos taken through airplane windows (multiple glass/plastic layers, scratches, reflections affect image quality). CENTRAL SUBJECT: Mount Fuji (Fujisan) - Japan's highest peak at 3,776 meters (12,389 feet), iconic stratovolcano located on Honshu island. Instantly recognizable symmetrical conical shape formed by volcanic activity over thousands of years. Mountain dominates center-lower portion of frame rising dramatically above surrounding landscape. SNOW CAP: Summit covered in brilliant white snow creating sharp contrast against darker volcanic rock below snow line. Snow appears bright, reflective in sunlight suggesting clear weather conditions. Classic Fuji silhouette - steep sides rising to pointed peak with distinctive snow coverage that makes mountain famous worldwide. SURROUNDING CLOUDS: Mid-altitude clouds form layer between airplane and ground. Clouds appear white, fluffy, cumulus-type formations scattered across visible area. Mount Fuji's peak rises ABOVE cloud layer - volcano is tall enough to penetrate through clouds, summit clearly visible while lower slopes partially obscured. This dramatic effect (mountain piercing cloud layer) creates iconic imagery frequently photographed from aircraft. ATMOSPHERE AND SKY: Upper portion shows gradient from deep blue at top (direction away from Earth) to lighter blue/cyan at horizon where atmosphere is thicker. Gradient is natural atmospheric effect caused by Rayleigh scattering - shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more, creating blue sky that fades toward white at horizon where light passes through more atmosphere. Transition zone between sky and horizon shows atmospheric haze - common at high altitude where distant views reveal Earth's atmosphere as visible layer. HORIZON: Critical element for flat Earth argument - horizon line appears essentially STRAIGHT/FLAT across entire width of image. No obvious curvature visible despite altitude of commercial aircraft (typically 30,000-40,000 feet / 9,000-12,000 meters). Flat Earth proponents argue: If Earth were spherical, curvature should be visible at this altitude. Horizon appearing flat \"proves\" Earth is flat plane, not sphere. TEXT OVERLAYS: Top text in black font reads: \"y'all be like... 'you're not high enough to see the curve...keep going'\" - Sarcastic quotation mocking globe Earth defenders who claim higher altitude is needed to see curvature. \"Y'all be like\" is internet slang format for mocking opposing viewpoints by paraphrasing them dismissively. Bottom right shows \"fb.com/fematters\" attribution. Bottom left shows timestamp \"2016-01-24, 8:19 PM\" indicating when image was posted/shared. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: Globe Earth believers keep moving goalposts - first they say curvature visible from tall buildings (it isn't), then from airplanes (it isn't), then from higher altitude (keep going). Image shows airplane-altitude view with flat horizon, challenging claim that commercial flight altitude reveals curvature. If Earth were 25,000 mile circumference sphere, shouldn't curvature be visible by now? Each time flat Earther points out flat horizon at given altitude, globe believers say \"go higher\" - convenient excuse that can continue indefinitely until reaching space (which flat Earthers believe is fake anyway). SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE - Why curvature isn't visible here: 1) ALTITUDE VS CURVATURE RATIO: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles (6,371 km). Commercial aircraft cruise at ~7 miles (35,000 feet) altitude. This is 0.18% of Earth's radius - extremely small percentage. Curvature visible at this ratio is minimal - approximately 3 degrees of arc across 60-degree field of view. Human eye struggles to detect such subtle curve against natural horizon irregularities. 2) FIELD OF VIEW LIMITATION: To see obvious curvature, need wide field of view capturing significant portion of Earth's circumference. Airplane window provides narrow field of view - maybe 60-90 degrees. At 35,000 feet, visible horizon is approximately 230 miles away. Earth's circumference is 25,000 miles, so visible horizon represents less than 1% of circumference. Expecting dramatic curve from \u003c1% sample is unrealistic. 3) ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS: Atmospheric refraction bends light, affecting horizon appearance. Haze, clouds, and atmospheric layers create visual effects that can mask or enhance apparent curvature. Clear conditions needed for accurate curvature observation. 4) CAMERA/WINDOW DISTORTION: Airplane windows are curved (for structural strength) and multi-layered. This can introduce optical distortion affecting straight lines. Consumer cameras also have lens distortion. These effects can flatten or curve horizon depending on window/lens combination. 5) ACTUALLY VISIBLE WITH PROPER CONDITIONS: At 35,000 feet with wide-angle view and clear conditions, subtle curvature IS detectable, but requires careful observation. Amateur high-altitude balloon experiments (100,000+ feet) clearly show curvature. Felix Baumgartner's 2012 space dive (128,000 feet) showed obvious curved horizon. ISS astronauts at 250+ miles altitude see dramatic curvature - entire Earth limb visible. MOUNT FUJI CONTEXT: Mountain's presence in frame actually helps demonstrate spherical Earth: Fuji visible from distance despite being \"below\" airplane altitude would be impossible on infinite flat plane (should be visible infinitely far away). Atmospheric haze limiting visibility consistent with spherical Earth where atmosphere curves away. Mountain appearing to \"rise\" from clouds demonstrates perspective consistent with spherical surface. PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS: Beautiful photograph regardless of intended message. Mount Fuji is World Heritage Site, culturally significant to Japan, frequently photographed from aircraft. This particular image captures classic view - snow-capped peak above clouds, clear sky, dramatic lighting. Photographer clearly captured special moment, even if captioning to support flat Earth belief. Image metadata suggests photo taken January 24, 2016 at 8:19 PM (likely Japan time, or time zone where poster located). Winter timing explains heavy snow coverage on Fuji. Flight likely trans-Pacific route or domestic Japanese flight passing near Fuji. MEME FORMAT ANALYSIS: \"Y'all be like...\" format is dismissive mocking structure. Puts words in opponent's mouth, then presents image as refutation. Implies globe Earth believers are desperate, constantly making excuses, never satisfied. Sarcasm (\"keep going\") suggests goalposts perpetually moving. Format effective for in-group humor but unconvincing to those who understand science of curvature visibility. ACTUAL CURVATURE VISIBILITY: Commercial airline passengers occasionally DO see subtle curvature under right conditions (very clear day, wide window view, careful observation). But it's subtle and easy to miss. Dramatic curvature visible at: ~60,000 feet (noticeable), ~100,000 feet (obvious), ~250+ miles (dramatic, whole Earth limb visible). This doesn't mean Earth is flat at lower altitudes - just means our vantage point is insufficient to easily detect curve at normal flight altitude. Like standing on basketball surface - curve exists but too gradual to see from close range. Zoom out (go higher) and curve becomes apparent. BOTTOM LINE: Image shows beautiful aerial photography but misunderstands relationship between altitude, field of view, and curvature detection. Horizon appearing flat from 35,000 feet is expected on spherical Earth - curvature at this altitude is approximately 0.04% deviation from straight line across typical field of view. Detecting such subtle curve requires precise instruments or much higher altitude. Image inadvertently demonstrates how normal observations at human scales fail to reveal planetary-scale geometry, explaining why ancient peoples (lacking high-altitude capability) assumed flat Earth. Technology allowing higher altitude observation consistently reveals curvature, confirming spherical model."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"15:T1f19,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Sarcastic meme labeling cell phone tower as \"REAL GPS SATELLITES\" claiming GPS works via ground towers not orbiting satellites. Image presents flat Earth argument that Global Positioning System operates through terrestrial infrastructure rather than space-based satellites, implying satellites don't exist or space travel is fake.

Main vertical pole is gray/silver metal with triangular lattice framework providing structural support. Multiple horizontal platforms/arms extend from upper portion at different heights supporting antenna equipment. ANTENNA ARRAYS: Upper section shows multiple white rectangular panel antennas - sector antennas typical of cellular base stations. Antennas arranged pointing outward in different directions to provide 360-degree coverage area. Each rectangular panel is directional antenna serving specific sector of coverage circle. Multiple panels at different heights may serve different frequencies/technologies (2G, 3G, 4G LTE, 5G). EQUIPMENT: Various gray/white equipment boxes visible mounted on tower - likely contain radio transceivers, amplifiers, power equipment. Cables run down tower connecting antennas to equipment and ground-level facilities. Metal framework includes climbing pegs/ladder for technician access during maintenance. Tower design is standard telecommunications infrastructure visible in urban/suburban areas worldwide. SKY BACKGROUND: Clear blue sky with few wispy white clouds.

Bottom of image in large bold white letters with black outline: \"REAL GPS SATELLITES\" - sarcastic caption implying these cell towers are what actually provide GPS signals, not satellites orbiting in space. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SATELLITES: Flat Earth model often claims satellites don't exist - space is fake, rockets can't reach \"space\" (which doesn't exist as described), everything attributed to satellites is actually done by ground-based infrastructure, high-altitude balloons, or other terrestrial technology. 2) GPS IS GROUND-BASED: Flat Earthers claim GPS works through network of ground towers (like cell towers), not 24+ orbiting satellites. Argument suggests: Government claims satellites but actually uses towers; we're told signals come from space but they come from terrestrial network; whole satellite narrative is cover story for flat Earth. 3) \"THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING\": If satellites are fake, then satellite photos of spherical Earth are fake, satellite communications are lie, space exploration is hoax, etc. Discrediting satellite technology supports broader flat Earth narrative that all space-related evidence for spherical Earth is fabricated. TECHNICAL REALITY - Why This Is Wrong: 1) CELL TOWERS ≠ GPS: Cell towers provide CELLULAR communications (phone calls, text messages, mobile data). GPS is SEPARATE system using dedicated satellites (not cell towers). These are different technologies serving different purposes. Cell phones CAN use cell tower triangulation for approximate location (cellular location services), but this is less accurate than GPS and different technology. 2) GPS SATELLITE SYSTEM: GPS (Global Positioning System) uses constellation of 24-32 satellites orbiting at approximately 20,200 km (12,550 miles) altitude. Each satellite broadcasts precise time signal and orbital position. GPS receivers calculate position by measuring time delays from multiple satellites (minimum 4) and solving geometric equations. This requires satellites at high altitude to provide wide coverage - ground towers couldn't provide GPS coverage over oceans, deserts, polar regions, mountains. 3) GPS ACCURACY: GPS provides meter-level accuracy globally, including over oceans thousands of miles from any land (and thus any cell towers). Ships, aircraft, hikers in wilderness, military operations in remote areas all use GPS where no cell towers exist. If GPS required ground towers, it wouldn't work in these locations - but it does. 4) OBSERVABLE SATELLITES: GPS satellites (and other satellites) can be: Tracked by amateur astronomers using telescopes; observed as moving points of light at dawn/dusk when sun illuminates them against dark sky; tracked by amateur radio operators who receive and decode their signals; located using apps showing real-time satellite positions (easily verified by looking at sky when app indicates satellite overhead). 5) INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS: Multiple countries operate independent satellite navigation systems: US GPS, Russian GLONASS, European Galileo, Chinese BeiDou, Indian NavIC, Japanese QZSS. Each country launched its own satellites, operates its own ground control, provides its own signals. Would require impossible international conspiracy for all these competing nations to fake satellite systems while actually using ground towers. 6) ORBITAL MECHANICS: Satellite positions predicted by Newtonian/Keplerian orbital mechanics - same physics explaining Moon orbit, planetary motion. Predictions verified by tracking satellites over decades. If satellites didn't exist or weren't where predicted, these calculations would fail - but they work precisely, confirming satellite locations. 7) LAUNCH VISIBILITY: Satellite launches visible to public - SpaceX launches from Florida/California watched by thousands of spectators who see rocket ascending, stage separation, satellites deploying. International Space Station visible to naked eye orbiting overhead. Claiming satellites don't exist requires dismissing direct observations by millions of people. CELL TOWER CAPABILITIES: Cell towers have limited range (few miles per tower), require line-of-sight, form networks that hand off signals as users move between coverage areas. Network designed for relatively small geographic areas with dense tower deployment in populated regions. Utterly incapable of providing global positioning across oceans, wilderness, or areas without tower infrastructure. Comparing cell tower to GPS satellite is fundamental misunderstanding of both technologies. IRONY: Image creator probably uses GPS daily (smartphone maps, navigation apps, vehicle GPS) without considering how signal reaches them over oceans during overseas flights, in national parks miles from cell service, or in rural areas with no towers visible. GPS working in these tower-free locations directly contradicts meme's claim. VISUAL RHETORIC: Meme works by: 1) Showing familiar infrastructure (cell tower) that audience has seen. 2) Labeling it with unfamiliar term (\"satellites\") creating dissonance. 3) Implying switch/revelation - what you thought were satellites are actually just towers. 4) Supporting broader flat Earth narrative that authorities lie about technology. Format is simple, shareable, requires no detailed argument. Works as thought-terminating image - instead of researching GPS technology, viewer remembers \"satellites are really just towers\" and dismisses satellite evidence. Effectiveness depends on audience's technical ignorance - anyone who understands GPS technology immediately recognizes image as nonsensical. But for those unfamiliar with how GPS works, meme plants seed of doubt about satellite reality. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) confirms this is propaganda supporting flat Earth narrative by attacking credibility of satellite technology and, by extension, any satellite-based evidence for spherical Earth.

Abizaid showing cover and Chapter 1 about water proving flat Earth. Two-panel photograph of antique publication demonstrating flat Earth beliefs existed in modern era, used by contemporary movement to show historical precedent for their beliefs. Image presents early 20th century flat Earth literature as evidence that questioning globe Earth has legitimate intellectual tradition. LEFT PANEL - BOOK COVER: Shows front cover of bound book in aged condition. Paper appears yellowed/cream colored typical of century-old publication. Cover shows signs of age - slight foxing (brown spots), wear at edges, fading. Design is typical early 1900s American publishing style - decorative but restrained. AMERICAN FLAG ILLUSTRATION: Upper portion of cover features waving American flag in full color (or appears to be - reds, blues visible). Flag shown on pole with decorative finial. Stars and stripes clearly depicted. Flag association with flat Earth book suggests author framing flat Earth belief as American/patriotic cause. TITLE TEXT: Below flag, \"SECOND EDITION\" in small capitals indicates book was successful enough to warrant reprinting. Main title \"THE ENLIGHTENMENT of THE WORLD\" in large serif font with decorative styling. Word \"of\" in smaller italic script connecting two title elements. \"THE WORLD\" positioned below with decorative underline/rule. AUTHOR: \"By JOHN G. ABIZAID\" in uppercase letters below title. John G. Abizaid was early 20th century flat Earth advocate, one of several authors publishing flat Earth arguments during this period. SUBTITLE/DESCRIPTION: Below author name, text reads: \"This book contains proof that the earth is flat and stationary, while the sun, moon and stars are in constant motion.\" This summarizes flat Earth geocentric model - stationary flat Earth with celestial bodies moving above/around it. Continues: \"Also letters showing the testimony of Scripture on the subject.\" Indicates religious/biblical arguments included, common in flat Earth literature combining pseudo-science with scriptural interpretation. DATE: \"1912\" at bottom establishing publication year - over 110 years ago, well into era when spherical Earth was established scientific fact (known since ancient Greece, confirmed by global navigation, photography, etc.). RIGHT PANEL - INTERIOR PAGE: Shows page 7 of book, beginning of Chapter 1. Page appears cream/off-white with clear black printed text in serif typeface typical of era. CHAPTER HEADING: \"CHAPTER I.\" centered at top in capitals. Below, \"THE WATER.\" as chapter title - first \"proof\" presented in book. TEXT CONTENT (full transcription): \"You know that there is more water on the earth than dry land. Here is the first proof: The water proves that the earth is flat, level and stationary. Water is liquid. It runs always down and seeks its level, and never runs up unless by power. And the water of the ocean is every way pretty near joined together on the earth, and they call it liquid. It will not stay on a round earth. Take a glass of water and pour it on a round ball and if the water stays on, then the earth must be round, but if the water falls off then the earth must be flat. This is the proof: Take a pan and fill it with water and see if it is higher in the center than on the sides. If this is true, then the water of the ocean might be round, but if the water in the pan is flat and level, then the water of the ocean must also be flat and level. The water of the ocean is level and can be nothing else, because it is liquid, which proves that the land is flat and not round. The land is not exactly flat and level, for there are mountains and valleys. But it makes no difference, for if the mountains were in the valleys it would leave the land flat and level and higher than the water. I have been thinking of the question for a long time. At last I have found out for myself from the water and the sunbeams, the sun's rising, the sunlight, etc., that the earth cannot be round and in motion, as books and teachers have taught. The teachers offer proofs to show that the earth is round, but the proofs they offer amount to nothing. When the children go to school, the teacher tells them the world is round, and, of course, they believe it, and they do not ask how it is round. They are young and they know very little. When they grow up they still believe the earth is round and in motion, and so in turn they teach this to others. The water is flat, which proves that the earth is flat and stationary. From its fruit you will know what kind of a tree it is.\" WATER ARGUMENT ANALYSIS: Abizaid's argument represents classic flat Earth reasoning still used today: 1) \"Water seeks its level\" - True for small scales where gravity pulls water to lowest point in container. 2) \"Water won't stay on round ball\" - Misunderstands gravity. Gravity pulls toward center of mass, not \"down\" in absolute direction. On sphere, gravity pulls water toward center, holding it on surface regardless of position. 3) \"Pan test\" - Compares small container (where surface tension and small scale make water appear flat) to ocean (where Earth's gravity holds water to spherical surface). Scale difference makes comparison invalid. 4) \"Ocean is level\" - \"Level\" in physics means perpendicular to gravity vector, not geometrically flat. Ocean IS level - perpendicular to gravity at every point - but this means following Earth's curved surface, not being flat plane. SCIENTIFIC REBUTTAL: 1) GRAVITY: Water stays on spherical Earth because gravity pulls toward Earth's center. \"Down\" is always toward center, not absolute direction. Water on ball falls off because ball's mass is too small for significant gravity - not because round things can't hold water. Earth's gravity holds oceans firmly to surface regardless of location. 2) SCALE: At ocean scale, water DOES follow Earth's curvature - that's why ships disappear hull-first over horizon, why lighthouses have limited range, why sea-level varies with latitude (bulge at equator from rotation). Curvature too gradual to see in pan of water, but measurable over distances. 3) \"LEVEL\" DEFINITION: Surveyors and engineers understand \"level\" means perpendicular to gravity, not geometrically flat. Large construction projects (bridges, tunnels, railways) must account for Earth's curvature - proves spherical Earth assumed and verified in civil engineering. 4) OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE: Ships disappearing bottom-first, time zones existing, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, photos from space - all confirm spherical Earth, contradict flat Earth water argument. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: 1912 was not period of scientific ignorance - spherical Earth known for over 2,000 years, confirmed by centuries of global navigation, established in all scientific education. Flat Earth belief in 1912 was fringe position held by small group contradicting overwhelming scientific consensus. Abizaid's book represents pseudo-scientific contrarianism, not legitimate scientific debate. RELIGIOUS COMPONENT: Reference to \"testimony of Scripture\" indicates flat Earth arguments often combined with biblical literalism - interpreting verses about \"four corners of earth,\" \"circle of earth,\" \"firmament\" as proof of flat cosmology. This tradition continues in modern flat Earth movement where religious belief often accompanies pseudo-scientific arguments. PURPOSE OF IMAGE: Showing 1912 flat Earth book serves modern flat Earth community by: 1) Demonstrating historical precedent - \"people have questioned globe Earth for centuries\" 2) Providing \"intellectual\" source material - book format suggests scholarly work 3) Connecting to American patriotism (flag imagery) 4) Linking to religious tradition (Scripture reference) 5) Showing arguments haven't changed - same \"water is level\" reasoning used today However, historical existence of flat Earth books proves only that some people held incorrect beliefs - not that beliefs were correct. Phrenology, alchemy, miasma theory also had books and adherents; existence doesn't validate. Attribution \"fb.com/fematters\" indicates modern flat Earth community sharing historical material to support contemporary conspiracy theory. Book is genuine historical artifact; interpretation placing it in legitimate scientific tradition is misleading."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"Other 379 | ZZZ Daily Images\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Historical 1912 flat Earth book \\\"The Enlightenment of the World\\\" by John G.
