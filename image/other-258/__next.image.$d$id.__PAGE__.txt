3:T8a5,Neil deGrasse Tyson oblate spheroid contradiction meme challenging Earth shape claims. Composite image questioning consistency of Earth shape descriptions from mainstream science. Red banner across top in white capital letters: 'SCIENCE NOW CLAIMS THE EARTH IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID THAT LOOKS LIKE A PEAR'. Below banner shows screenshot of verified Twitter/X post from Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) with blue checkmark. Tweet reads: 'Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator'. Timestamp: '9:01 AM - 19 Sep 2014'. Middle section displays three circular objects for comparison: Left shows Earth photo from July 16, 2015 (NASA/NOAA/DSCOVR) with moon visible for scale - appears perfectly round. Center shows 'PERFECT CIRCLE' label in cyan circle on black background. Right shows Jupiter image (NASA/ESA/Goddard/UCBerkeley/JPL-Caltech/STScI) with visible bands - also appears round. Text notes: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles'. Lower section shows larger Earth image with measurement annotations: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles' with left-right arrow, 'Polar diameter 12,714 km - 7900.113 miles' with up-down arrow. Red text box states: 'THIS IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID (ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUATOR AND POLES)'. Bottom text in large red letters on black background: 'SOMEONE'S CLEARLY LYING'. Small logo in bottom right corner. Flat Earth argument claims photographs show Earth as perfect circle, contradicting oblate spheroid or pear shape descriptions. Points out 42 km (26 mile) difference between equatorial and polar diameters is negligible - less than 0.3% difference, imperceptible in photos. However, Earth IS measurably oblate due to rotation causing equatorial bulge. Difference is real but too small to see in most photos without precise measurements. Oblateness = (equatorial - polar) / equatorial = 0.0033 or 1/298.257. Pear shape refers to even smaller asymmetry where southern hemisphere is slightly wider - difference of mere meters, completely invisible in photographs. Scientific descriptions refer to precise geodetic measurements, not visual appearance in photos4:T5ce,Redditor's Wife meme about flat Earth research obsession. Classic two-panel internet meme format using 'Redditor's Wife' template showing relationship priorities versus online rabbit holes. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'HONEY ARE YOU COMING TO BED?'. Image shows woman with long blonde hair wearing blue pajamas standing behind her partner who sits at computer desk. Woman has concerned, patient expression with hand on hip. Man sits hunched forward intensely focused on computer monitor, face partially visible in profile showing concentration. Entire scene bathed in cool blue tones suggesting late night/early morning. Computer screen glow illuminates man's face. Bottom text: 'AFTER I FIGURE OUT IF THE EARTH IS REALLY FLAT'. Watermark 'JM' in bottom right. Humorous commentary on people becoming consumed by conspiracy theory research, spending excessive time investigating flat Earth claims instead of normal activities like sleep. Relatable format shows partner's frustration with obsessive online behavior. Meme reflects common pattern where individuals discover flat Earth theory and become absorbed in endless YouTube videos, forums, and 'research' trying to determine truth, often at expense of relationships and responsibilities. Blue color palette reinforces late-night internet browsing aesthetic. Template originated from stock photo and became popular for depicting situations where someone prioritizes internet activity over real-world obligations5:T80a,Flat Earth cosmology diagram showing 24-hour sun cycle with Fibonacci and prime number symbolism. Artistic educational diagram titled at top: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE' on beige/tan border. Central image shows dome Earth model with firmament enclosed circular plane. Earth disc displays continents in green against blue oceans, surrounded by dark blue/black dome or barrier. Ice ring/Antarctica forms outer edge. Above Earth floats sun symbol - yellow/cream circle with radiating triangular rays representing light. Small circle below sun indicates moon or another celestial body. Around central Earth arranged circular pattern of numbers 1-24 representing 24-hour clock/day cycle. Numbers positioned in clockwise arrangement: top has 13, 14, 15 (daylight hours), continuing around through 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 (nighttime hours) on dark blue section, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 completing circle. Dashed curved line segments between numbers suggest sun's circular path around Earth center. Numbers have dual significance indicated by legend at bottom: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS' (left side, white dot) and 'PRIME NUMBERS' (right side, white dot with circle). Some numbers marked with circled symbols indicating both properties. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...) where each number is sum of previous two, appears in nature (spirals, growth patterns). Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom subtitle: 'THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN'. Aesthetic combines vintage scientific illustration style with modern flat Earth cosmology. Suggests mathematical/mystical significance to 24-hour solar cycle in flat Earth model. Sun circles above stationary plane creating day/night cycle through proximity. Dark blue section represents night side where sun is distant. Diagram implies intelligent design through mathematical patterns embedded in timekeeping and celestial mechanics. Beige border and serif font give antique authority appearance, mimicking historical astronomical charts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-258","title":"Other 258","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705695_463942567138816_8315476017983997757_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-257","title":"Other 257","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705553_465968800269526_6465967269783807386_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-259","title":"THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705737_464902197042853_6204340604245065291_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
