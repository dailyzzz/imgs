5:T8a5,Neil deGrasse Tyson oblate spheroid contradiction meme challenging Earth shape claims. Composite image questioning consistency of Earth shape descriptions from mainstream science. Red banner across top in white capital letters: 'SCIENCE NOW CLAIMS THE EARTH IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID THAT LOOKS LIKE A PEAR'. Below banner shows screenshot of verified Twitter/X post from Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) with blue checkmark. Tweet reads: 'Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator'. Timestamp: '9:01 AM - 19 Sep 2014'. Middle section displays three circular objects for comparison: Left shows Earth photo from July 16, 2015 (NASA/NOAA/DSCOVR) with moon visible for scale - appears perfectly round. Center shows 'PERFECT CIRCLE' label in cyan circle on black background. Right shows Jupiter image (NASA/ESA/Goddard/UCBerkeley/JPL-Caltech/STScI) with visible bands - also appears round. Text notes: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles'. Lower section shows larger Earth image with measurement annotations: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles' with left-right arrow, 'Polar diameter 12,714 km - 7900.113 miles' with up-down arrow. Red text box states: 'THIS IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID (ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUATOR AND POLES)'. Bottom text in large red letters on black background: 'SOMEONE'S CLEARLY LYING'. Small logo in bottom right corner. Flat Earth argument claims photographs show Earth as perfect circle, contradicting oblate spheroid or pear shape descriptions. Points out 42 km (26 mile) difference between equatorial and polar diameters is negligible - less than 0.3% difference, imperceptible in photos. However, Earth IS measurably oblate due to rotation causing equatorial bulge. Difference is real but too small to see in most photos without precise measurements. Oblateness = (equatorial - polar) / equatorial = 0.0033 or 1/298.257. Pear shape refers to even smaller asymmetry where southern hemisphere is slightly wider - difference of mere meters, completely invisible in photographs. Scientific descriptions refer to precise geodetic measurements, not visual appearance in photos0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 258 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Neil deGrasse Tyson oblate spheroid contradiction meme challenging Earth shape claims.
