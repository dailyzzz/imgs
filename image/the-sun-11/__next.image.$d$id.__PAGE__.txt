Header reads 'The EXACT SCIENCE!' with subtitle 'Sun's distance from Earth-' followed by chronological list of astronomers' estimates in large red text: Copernicus 3 million miles, Tycho Brahe 13 million miles, Kepler 13 million miles, Newton 28 million miles, Newton (2nd attempt) 54 million miles, Martin 1754 81/82 million miles, Encke 1869 95.274.000 million miles, Mleyer 104 million miles, R.Ball 92/93 million miles. Bottom text emphasizes 'only 100 million miles difference!' with underlining. Argues that dramatic variations in historical measurements (ranging from 3 to 104 million miles) demonstrate fundamental inconsistency in scientific method and casts doubt on current accepted value of 93 million miles. Presents evolving scientific understanding as evidence of unreliability rather than refinement of measurement techniques"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-10","title":"The Sun 10","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/18839133_10211832602962117_6547347150306283342_n.jpeg","description":"Meme titled 'HELIOCENTRIC CONTRADICTIONS' with black text on white background listing perceived inconsistencies: 'If we are enclosed in a vacuum...' followed by bullet points: '1. Why doesn't the atmosphere get sucked into it?' '2. Why don't satellites or the ISS get sucked in?' '3. Why do you say wind is caused by air pressure? Especially if space is a vacuum?' '4. If you are already in a vacuum, why do you need to escape it?' '5. When you're already supposed to be in space?' '6. Why isn't a level, level?' Questions mainstream astronomy model regarding atmosphere retention in vacuum of space, satellite mechanics, atmospheric pressure physics, and concept of escaping atmosphere when space is already vacuum.

Top row labeled 'Watch the Sun.' shows three photographs of sun progressively descending toward horizon over landscape, maintaining relatively consistent apparent size. Bottom row labeled 'Think about the Sun.' shows three photographs where sun appears noticeably smaller and dimmer as it approaches horizon, with final panel showing sun as small orange dot. Sequence demonstrates phenomenon where setting sun appears to shrink in angular size, which is used to argue sun is moving away from observer rather than Earth rotating. Presents atmospheric refraction, perspective effects, and increased atmospheric scattering at low angles as evidence for local, nearby sun moving away horizontally rather than distant sun being obscured by Earth's curvature due to rotation"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
