Image shows silhouette of person diving or falling, captured mid-air with arms and legs extended in graceful pose against sunset/sunrise sky. Person's silhouette is reflected perfectly in still water below, creating mirror symmetry effect. Water surface shows golden-orange sunset colors with clouds reflected. Warm peachy-orange and blue tones in sky with dark rippled water. Image is vertically flipped to create humorous 'Meanwhile in Australia' effect where person appears to be falling upward from water into sky, playing on Southern Hemisphere 'upside down' stereotype.
