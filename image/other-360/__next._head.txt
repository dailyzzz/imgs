5:T1838,Upside-down tourist at South Pole sign sarcastically asking about gravity. Humorous photograph showing person in inverted orientation next to South Pole marker with sarcastic text questioning gravity concept. Image deliberately rotated 180 degrees to make person appear upside-down, creating visual joke about gravity's effect (or lack thereof) at bottom of Earth. Main subject shows tourist/visitor in winter expedition clothing standing (appearing to stand upside-down from viewer's perspective) next to ceremonial South Pole marker sign at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica. Person wears heavy olive/green insulated parka or winter jacket suitable for extreme Antarctic cold, hood up or off, dark pants or snow pants, winter boots. Person's body orientation upside-down in frame - head at bottom, feet at top - standing on sky as if defying gravity. Person appears to be posing for photograph with arms visible, possibly in casual stance. Face visible showing tourist enjoying moment at South Pole. Prominent blue sign in image shows official Amundsen-Scott South Pole marker (ceremonial pole, not geographic pole marker). Sign is rectangular blue placard with white/silver text and official NSF (National Science Foundation) logo with gear symbol. Text on sign reads "The U.S. National Science Foundation welcomes you to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station" followed by additional text showing coordinates and "established 1957" or similar historical information. Sign positioned vertically (but appears horizontal due to 180-degree rotation). Geographic South Pole (90°00' South latitude) marked at this research station. Background shows Antarctic environment - distinctive sky typical of polar region showing high thin clouds (cirrus or contrails) creating wispy patterns across pale blue sky. Sky takes up significant portion of frame due to image rotation - what would normally be ground now appears as sky at top. Actual ground surface (appearing at top of rotated image due to inversion) shows white snow/ice characteristic of Antarctic plateau. Some structures barely visible in far background - likely buildings of Amundsen-Scott Station including modular research facilities, fuel tanks, equipment. Station located at geographic South Pole on Antarctic plateau at elevation of approximately 9,300 feet, sitting on ~9,000 feet of ice over land. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF" setting up sarcastic question. Bottom text in enormous bold white letters with black outline: "GRAVITY?" completing phrase with emphasized word. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Humor/sarcasm operates on multiple levels: 1) Image mockingly references flat Earth argument that people in Southern Hemisphere, especially Antarctica, would be "upside down" on globe Earth and would fall off due to gravity pulling "down" (toward viewer's perspective). By rotating image 180 degrees so person appears upside-down, meme creates visual representation of "upside-down Australians" argument. 2) "Haven't you heard of gravity?" is sarcastic response to flat Earth claims. From mainstream science perspective, line mocks flat Earthers for not understanding gravity - gravity pulls toward Earth's center from all directions, so no one is actually "upside down." Everyone stands on ground with gravity pulling feet down, regardless of latitude. From flat Earth perspective, line could mock mainstream believers - sarcastically suggesting gravity explanation is absurd patch applied to cover problems with globe model. 3) Image deliberately creates impossible scenario (person standing inverted on sky) to visualize flat Earth concern about Southern Hemisphere. On actual globe Earth, person at South Pole stands normally with gravity pulling toward Earth's center beneath feet. "Down" is defined by gravity, not by external reference frame. Photo manipulation emphasizes absurdity of "upside down" concern. 4) South Pole location is particularly relevant - on globe, South Pole is antipodal to North Pole, representing "bottom" of Earth in common visualization. Flat Earth models typically place North Pole at center of disc and Antarctica as ice wall around perimeter, completely different arrangement. By showing South Pole, image addresses central difference between models. In reality, person photographed stood normally on Antarctic ice with gravity pulling toward Earth's center beneath feet, same sensation as standing anywhere else. Image was rotated in post-processing to create upside-down effect. Actual sensation of standing at South Pole is normal - no sense of being inverted, tilted, or defying gravity. This is because gravity defines local vertical at every location. Scientific explanation: Gravity is force of attraction between masses. Earth's mass creates gravitational field pointing toward its center. At every point on Earth's surface, gravity pulls objects toward center, defining "down." Observers at all locations feel gravity pulling them toward ground beneath feet. There is no absolute "up" or "down" in space - only directions relative to massive bodies. On spherical Earth, "down" varies with position (points toward center), but local experience is consistent everywhere. Flat Earth models typically struggle to explain: 1) Why gravity would pull uniformly "down" through flat plane rather than toward geometric center, 2) How gravity could create consistent pull on infinite plane, 3) Why Southern Hemisphere observations match antipodal relationship predicted by globe (stars, seasons, flight times, sun angles). Meme's effectiveness comes from visual humor - rotated photo creates immediately absurd-looking scenario (person standing on sky) that requires explanation. Whether viewed as mocking flat Earth or mocking globe believers, image generates engagement and discussion about gravity's nature. Irony: photograph taken at real South Pole research station confirms Antarctica is accessible continent with permanent science presence - contradicting flat Earth claims that Antarctica is forbidden ice wall that can't be explored or is patrolled by military to prevent people from reaching edge.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 360 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Upside-down tourist at South Pole sign sarcastically asking about gravity.
