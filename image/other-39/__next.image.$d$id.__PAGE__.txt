3:T487,Chronological comparison of eight NASA Earth images from 1975 to 2015 on black background. Top text: 'Official NASA images of "Earth from Space". You have to be physically blind or mentally blind to not see the huge differences.' Shows grid of Earth photographs: 1975 (grayscale/desaturated), 1997 (vibrant blue with Americas), 2002 (showing different hemisphere with Pacific), 2007 (two different versions with varying color saturation and continent positions), 2012 (Blue Marble with Africa/Europe/Asia), 2013 (showing different angle/composition), 2015 (another Blue Marble variant). Bottom text: 'The number one reason people believe in "the ball Earth" is they think there are images of Earth from space. NASA admitted on their own website, Robert Simmon's used Photoshop to create the "blue marble" image. Visit WILL157.com/Earth-Realm-2 for an extraordinary amount of hard evidence that disproves the "ball Earth".' Claims inconsistencies in continent sizes, colors, and proportions across different NASA images prove fabrication rather than reflecting different cameras, processing techniques, composite methods, and viewing angles over 40-year period0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-39","title":"Other 39","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/png-1.png","description":"Earth curvature calculator technical diagram titled 'Automated Calculator For The Curvature Of The Earth - Imperial System'.
