3:T4f1,Two-row comparison showing evolution of Earth photographs with color inconsistencies. Black background with four spherical Earth images across timeline. Top row shows original images: 1967 - Single image from ATS3 Satellite in geostationary orbit 22,197 miles above Earth, showing greenish-teal tones with white clouds and brown landmasses. 1972 - Single image from Apollo 17 lunar mission 28,000 miles above Earth (famous 'Blue Marble'), showing deep blue oceans with white cloud swirls. 2002 - Composite image taken over 8 days from Terra satellite 443 miles above Earth, showing bright blue oceans with green continents. 2015 - Single image from DSCOVR Satellite at L1 point 930,000 miles above Earth, showing pale blue-gray tones. Middle text reads 'Adjusting Color and Contrast Randomly'. Bottom row shows same four images with dramatically altered color grading - 1967 appears more neutral gray-green, 1972 shows enhanced deep blue, 2002 appears more gray-brown, 2015 shows vivid saturated blue. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Questions why official NASA Earth photographs from different missions, satellites, and distances show such dramatic color variations, suggesting inconsistent post-processing or manipulation rather than accurate representations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-115","title":"Other 115","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10399379_466516020214804_2304525427413536251_n.jpg","description":"Skeptical Robert Downey Jr. meme showing actor in dark suit and polka dot tie with arms crossed, making dubious facial expression with raised eyebrow and slight smirk.

Bottom text: 'WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' with 'JM' logo. Popular meme format expressing skepticism toward claims of personally observing Earth's curvature from commercial airplanes or high altitude. Suggests such claims are either mistaken, exaggerated, or dishonest since curvature requires much higher altitude than passenger flights to be visible. Uses Downey Jr.'s incredulous expression to convey doubt about everyday curvature sightings, implying horizon always appears flat to human observers at accessible altitudes"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-114","title":"Other 114","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10394586_477735822426157_7723607760489303489_n.jpg","description":"Magic trick metaphor meme with golden/yellow gradient background. Shows white-gloved hand holding black magician's wand with white tip, pulling spherical Earth (blue marble image showing continents and white clouds) out of classic black top hat. Image represents sleight-of-hand deception. Bottom text in white reads: 'It doesn't matter what anyone believes, it's what the world wants us to believe that matters.' Second line: 'Whatever it may be, it won't be the truth.' Bottom left shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' watermark. Uses classic magic trick imagery (rabbit from hat) to suggest globe Earth is illusion created by those in power rather than observable reality. Implies mainstream cosmology is deliberate deception designed to control public perception regardless of truth. Presents skepticism toward authority and established narratives, suggesting powerful entities dictate belief systems. Magic metaphor emphasizes misdirection and sleight of hand in presenting spherical Earth model to public"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-116","title":"Other 116","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10400529_469035413296198_2794825867189002207_n.jpg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
