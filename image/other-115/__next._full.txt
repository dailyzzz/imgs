13:T4f1,Two-row comparison showing evolution of Earth photographs with color inconsistencies. Black background with four spherical Earth images across timeline. Top row shows original images: 1967 - Single image from ATS3 Satellite in geostationary orbit 22,197 miles above Earth, showing greenish-teal tones with white clouds and brown landmasses. 1972 - Single image from Apollo 17 lunar mission 28,000 miles above Earth (famous 'Blue Marble'), showing deep blue oceans with white cloud swirls. 2002 - Composite image taken over 8 days from Terra satellite 443 miles above Earth, showing bright blue oceans with green continents. 2015 - Single image from DSCOVR Satellite at L1 point 930,000 miles above Earth, showing pale blue-gray tones. Middle text reads 'Adjusting Color and Contrast Randomly'. Bottom row shows same four images with dramatically altered color grading - 1967 appears more neutral gray-green, 1972 shows enhanced deep blue, 2002 appears more gray-brown, 2015 shows vivid saturated blue. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Questions why official NASA Earth photographs from different missions, satellites, and distances show such dramatic color variations, suggesting inconsistent post-processing or manipulation rather than accurate representations9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-115","title":"Other 115","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10399379_466516020214804_2304525427413536251_n.jpg","description":"Skeptical Robert Downey Jr. meme showing actor in dark suit and polka dot tie with arms crossed, making dubious facial expression with raised eyebrow and slight smirk.
