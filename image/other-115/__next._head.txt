Bottom text: 'WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU THEY'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' with 'JM' logo. Popular meme format expressing skepticism toward claims of personally observing Earth's curvature from commercial airplanes or high altitude. Suggests such claims are either mistaken, exaggerated, or dishonest since curvature requires much higher altitude than passenger flights to be visible. Uses Downey Jr.'s incredulous expression to convey doubt about everyday curvature sightings, implying horizon always appears flat to human observers at accessible altitudes"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Other 115"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Skeptical Robert Downey Jr. meme showing actor in dark suit and polka dot tie with arms crossed, making dubious facial expression with raised eyebrow and sli..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/10399379_466516020214804_2304525427413536251_n.jpg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
