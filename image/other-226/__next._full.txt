13:T547,Steve Harvey meme mocking Family Feud wrong answer format. Shows Steve Harvey, comedian and television host, on stage in formal attire. Harvey wears black tuxedo jacket with subtle pattern or texture, white dress shirt, black bow tie. Clean-shaven bald head, distinctive thick black mustache, wide white-toothed smile showing enthusiasm. Holds black microphone in right hand near mouth as if announcing or reacting. Left hand gestures expressively. Background shows dark teal-blue with blurred stage lights creating bokeh effect - suggests TV studio setting like Family Feud game show which Harvey hosts. Body language conveys animated, dramatic reaction typical of his comedic hosting style. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'THE EARTH IS A SPINNING BALL'. Meme format mimics Family Feud show where Harvey reacts to contestants giving obviously wrong answers with exaggerated disbelief. Implies belief in spinning globe Earth is comically wrong answer equivalent to absurd Family Feud responses. Harvey's enthusiastic delivery makes statement appear ridiculous. Uses humor to frame mainstream cosmology as laughable rather than scientifically established. Leverages Harvey's comedic persona and Family Feud's wrong-answer culture to delegitimize globe Earth model14:T591,Antarctic Treaty flag design with azimuthal projection. Shows simplified flag or emblem design on dark navy blue background. Center displays white silhouette of Antarctica continent showing irregular coastline with peninsulas, bays, indentations. Antarctica positioned at center with North Pole/Arctic perspective. Surrounding continent are concentric white circles representing latitude lines at regular intervals. Radiating from center point are straight white lines extending outward like compass rays or longitude lines - approximately 12-16 lines creating pie-slice sections. Lines extend beyond outer circle to edges of image. Design creates azimuthal equidistant projection pattern with Antarctica at pole position. This is actual design of Antarctic Treaty flag adopted in 1959, also used as United Nations emblem. Flat Earth proponents cite this flag as evidence that governments know true Earth map. Argue Antarctica positioned at center with radiating longitude lines matches flat Earth model where Antarctica forms ice wall perimeter and continents radiate from North Pole center. Antarctic Treaty of 1959 established Antarctica as scientific preserve and banned military activity. Conspiracy theorists claim treaty exists to prevent exploration of ice wall and keep flat Earth secret. UN flag uses identical azimuthal equidistant projection, which flat Earthers interpret as hidden truth displayed in plain sight15:T5a5,Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle wheel on moon surface with visible tire tracks. Shows Apollo moon mission photograph of LRV (Lunar Roving Vehicle/moon buggy) on lunar surface. Visible portion shows vehicle's wire-mesh wheel in center-right - distinctive tire made of woven metal wire creating chevron/zigzag tread pattern for traction in lunar regolith. Wheel appears silver-gray metallic. Attached to wheel is white/light gray landing leg or strut structure, mechanical components, and what appears to be astronaut's boot in white spacesuit material upper right. Lunar surface shows fine gray dust/regolith with visible tire tracks impressed into surface - two white arrows point to clear tread marks showing chevron pattern pressed into moon dust, one track in foreground left, another in background right. Surface appears uniformly gray with small rocks and pebbles scattered throughout. Top displays large white bold text: 'GOT TRACKS?' in impact font with black outline. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark. Photograph intended to show evidence of moon landings through tire tracks. Moon hoax skeptics question why tracks are so crisp and well-defined in vacuum with no atmospheric moisture to hold shape. Also question why dust doesn't stick to astronaut boots or why rover doesn't throw up dust plumes like it should in low gravity one-sixth Earth's. Argue photographs show inconsistencies with expected lunar environment behavior9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-226","title":"Other 226","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657953_462403280626078_1359173339570927437_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-225","title":"Other 225","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657265_461770377356035_3408845659044911063_o.png","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-227","title":"Other 227","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661856_461369637396109_4173555124706847413_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
