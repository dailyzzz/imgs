5:T1bc0,Airplane silhouette with dramatic shadow rays extending from sun, questioning how such shadow would be possible if sun were 93 million miles away. Flat Earth meme using atmospheric optical phenomenon to challenge conventional astronomical distance to sun, arguing shadow effects prove sun is small and local rather than distant star. Image shows striking sky photograph with flat Earth argument overlay. PHOTOGRAPH: Dramatic sky image showing airplane silhouette against bright cloudy sky with sun directly behind/near aircraft. Sun creates intense backlighting effect. Airplane appears as dark silhouette - small aircraft shape visible against bright sky. Wings, fuselage, tail visible in profile. Appears to be commercial or private aircraft at altitude. SHADOW RAYS: Most striking visual element - dark rays/streaks appear to radiate outward from airplane/sun position in multiple directions. These shadowy bands extend across cloudy sky creating dramatic visual effect. Rays appear to emanate from single point (near sun/airplane) and spread outward in all directions. Effect creates impression of shadows being cast in 3D space through atmosphere. ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS: Hazy/cloudy sky with high moisture content visible. Sun partially obscured by aircraft and atmospheric haze. Clouds scattered throughout frame catching light and creating contrast. Blue-gray atmospheric coloring with bright white/yellow near sun position. These conditions (high moisture, particulates in air) create visible light scattering effects. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text: "WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET THIS SHADOW..." Bottom text: "IF THE SUN WERE 93 MILLION MILES AWAY?" Question format challenges accepted astronomical distance. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SHADOW GEOMETRY: If sun were truly 93 million miles away, its rays would arrive essentially parallel (like train tracks appearing parallel at distance). Shadow from tiny airplane couldn't create diverging rays visible across sky. Divergent shadows suggest point light source nearby, not distant star. 2) LOCAL SUN MODEL: Flat Earth cosmology typically proposes sun is small (approximately 32 miles diameter) and close (approximately 3,000 miles altitude), circling above flat plane. This local sun would create divergent shadows as seen in image - light rays spreading from nearby point source rather than arriving parallel from distant source. 3) PERSPECTIVE PROOF: Visible shadow rays "prove" sun cannot be 93 million miles away - shadow geometry visible to naked eye demonstrates nearby light source. If mainstream astronomy correct, this visual effect should be impossible. SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION - What's Actually Happening: 1) CREPUSCULAR RAYS: This phenomenon is called "crepuscular rays" (or sometimes "God rays" or "sunbeams"). Common atmospheric optical effect occurring when: Sun's light passes through gaps in clouds or around obstacles. Atmospheric particles (dust, water vapor, pollution) scatter light making beams visible. Contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas of atmosphere creates visible rays. Effect is perspective illusion - rays are actually parallel but appear to diverge due to perspective (like railroad tracks appearing to converge at distance, but in reverse). 2) PERSPECTIVE GEOMETRY: Parallel lines appear to converge toward vanishing point when receding from viewer. When parallel sunbeams extend toward viewer, they appear to diverge from point near sun. Same reason why roads appear to meet at horizon - parallel lines create perspective illusion of convergence/divergence depending on direction. Rays in image ARE essentially parallel (from 93-million-mile distant sun), but APPEAR to spread out due to perspective from viewer's position. 3) ANTICREPUSCULAR RAYS: If you turn around 180 degrees when seeing crepuscular rays, you can sometimes see "anticrepuscular rays" - same parallel beams appearing to CONVERGE toward antisolar point. Same rays appearing to both diverge AND converge depending on direction you look. This confirms rays are parallel and appearance is perspective effect. 4) WHY AIRPLANE CREATES THIS: Airplane passing near line-of-sight to sun creates small shadow in atmosphere. With right atmospheric conditions (particles to scatter light, moisture making beams visible), shadow becomes visible as dark ray. Aircraft's small shadow extended through miles of atmosphere creates visible streak. Sun's parallel rays create parallel shadow, but perspective makes it appear to radiate from sun. 5) REPRODUCIBLE WITH PARALLEL LIGHT: You can recreate this effect with known parallel light source. Photography of laser beams in dusty room shows same perspective effect. Known parallel beams appear divergent when viewed from certain angles. This confirms effect is perspective illusion, not proof of local light source. TECHNICAL PHOTOGRAPHY NOTE: This type of dramatic crepuscular ray photograph requires: High particulate/moisture content in atmosphere (makes light rays visible). Sun at right angle relative to clouds/obstacles. Camera positioned to capture contrast between lit and shadowed atmosphere. Images like this often captured at sunrise/sunset when sun angle and atmospheric conditions optimal. Nothing about photograph is unusual or unexpected - common atmospheric phenomenon photographers seek out for dramatic effect. FLAT EARTH LOGIC FLAW: Argument assumes divergent-appearing rays prove divergent reality. But: Parallel railroad tracks appear to converge - nobody concludes rails actually touch. Parallel building edges appear to converge at top - nobody concludes building is narrower at top. Same perspective rules apply to sunbeams - parallel rays appear divergent from certain viewing angles. Claiming divergent appearance proves divergent reality demonstrates misunderstanding of perspective geometry. SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS: Crepuscular rays have been understood and explained by atmospheric optics for centuries. No optical physicist, meteorologist, or astronomer considers this evidence against distant sun. Phenomenon perfectly consistent with 93-million-mile distant sun plus atmospheric scattering plus perspective effects. Amateur photographers, pilots, and meteorologists observe this regularly without concluding sun is nearby. IMAGE SOURCE: Photograph appears to be legitimate atmospheric optical phenomenon capture - possibly by amateur photographer or aviation enthusiast. Flat Earth community added text overlay to repurpose as propaganda. Original photographer likely not associated with flat Earth movement. Image illustrates beautiful natural phenomenon being misrepresented as evidence for pseudo-scientific claim. VISUAL APPEAL: Dramatic image creates engagement. Viewers genuinely impressed by striking visual effect. Emotional response ("wow, look at that!") primes acceptance of accompanying text. Question format ("would it be possible...?") invites viewer to answer "no" based on intuition rather than understanding of atmospheric optics. Effective propaganda technique using beautiful imagery to make false claim seem plausible.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 387 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Airplane silhouette with dramatic shadow rays extending from sun, questioning how such shadow would be possible if sun were 93 million miles away.
