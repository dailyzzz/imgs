5:T82a,Eight major phases of the moon diagram for flat Earth cosmology. Educational astronomical diagram showing lunar phases in flat Earth context. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on solid black background displays eight circular representations of moon phases arranged in two columns of four. Each phase numbered 1-8 with descriptive label below. Left column top to bottom: Phase 1 (NEW MOON): Completely dark circle appearing black/dark gray representing moon's dark side facing Earth. Phase 2 (WAXING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white illuminated on right side, rest dark, showing moon 12.5% illuminated. Phase 3 (FIRST QUARTER): Exactly half moon illuminated - right half cream-white, left half dark, 50% illuminated at right angle to sun. Phase 4 (WAXING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on left, 75% illuminated approaching full. Right column: Phase 5 (FULL MOON): Completely illuminated cream-white circle showing moon's fully lit face, 100% illuminated opposite sun. Phase 6 (WANING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on right side, 75% illuminated after full moon. Phase 7 (LAST QUARTER): Exactly half illuminated - left half cream-white, right half dark, 50% illuminated moving toward new moon. Phase 8 (WANING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white on left side, rest dark, 12.5% illuminated approaching new moon. Phases arranged symmetrically showing progression through ~29.5-day lunar cycle. Bottom text on beige border: '8 MAJOR PHASES OF THE MOON'. Diagram accurately depicts phases as seen from Earth. However, flat Earth models struggle to explain lunar phases. Standard model: moon orbits Earth reflecting sunlight, different positions create phases. Flat Earth models propose various mechanisms: moon generates own light that turns on/off, transparent rotating moon, or localized spotlight sun. None adequately explain why same phase visible globally simultaneously or why phases correlate with moon's position relative to sun0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 287 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Eight major phases of the moon diagram for flat Earth cosmology.
