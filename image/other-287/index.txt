13:T82a,Eight major phases of the moon diagram for flat Earth cosmology. Educational astronomical diagram showing lunar phases in flat Earth context. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on solid black background displays eight circular representations of moon phases arranged in two columns of four. Each phase numbered 1-8 with descriptive label below. Left column top to bottom: Phase 1 (NEW MOON): Completely dark circle appearing black/dark gray representing moon's dark side facing Earth. Phase 2 (WAXING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white illuminated on right side, rest dark, showing moon 12.5% illuminated. Phase 3 (FIRST QUARTER): Exactly half moon illuminated - right half cream-white, left half dark, 50% illuminated at right angle to sun. Phase 4 (WAXING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on left, 75% illuminated approaching full. Right column: Phase 5 (FULL MOON): Completely illuminated cream-white circle showing moon's fully lit face, 100% illuminated opposite sun. Phase 6 (WANING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on right side, 75% illuminated after full moon. Phase 7 (LAST QUARTER): Exactly half illuminated - left half cream-white, right half dark, 50% illuminated moving toward new moon. Phase 8 (WANING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white on left side, rest dark, 12.5% illuminated approaching new moon. Phases arranged symmetrically showing progression through ~29.5-day lunar cycle. Bottom text on beige border: '8 MAJOR PHASES OF THE MOON'. Diagram accurately depicts phases as seen from Earth. However, flat Earth models struggle to explain lunar phases. Standard model: moon orbits Earth reflecting sunlight, different positions create phases. Flat Earth models propose various mechanisms: moon generates own light that turns on/off, transparent rotating moon, or localized spotlight sun. None adequately explain why same phase visible globally simultaneously or why phases correlate with moon's position relative to sun14:T8d5,Numbers and geometric structures diagram showing angles in digits with Fibonacci and prime number notation. Educational mathematical diagram displaying numbers 0-9 as geometric shapes with angle counts. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows stylized digits arranged in 3x3 grid plus header circle. Top center shows white circle labeled '0 Angle' representing zero. Upper left text in red italics: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS', upper right in blue italics: 'PRIME NUMBERS'. Grid shows numbers 1-9, each designed with straight line segments forming angles marked in different colors. Number 1 (upper left): Red vertical line with single angle marked, labeled '1 Angle'. Number 2 (upper center): Blue angular shape resembling '2' with two marked angles, labeled '2 Angles'. Number 3 (upper right): Blue curved/angular '3' with three angles marked, labeled '3 Angles'. Number 4 (middle left): White angular '4' with four angles marked, labeled '4 Angles'. Number 5 (middle center): Red angular '5' shape with blue overlapping triangular structure showing five angles marked, labeled '5 Angles'. Number 6 (middle right): White angular design with six angles marked, labeled '6 Angles'. Number 7 (lower left): Blue angular '7' with seven angles marked, labeled '7 Angles'. Number 8 (lower center): Red symmetrical design composed of two triangles forming hourglass/double pyramid with eight angles marked, labeled '8 Angles'. Number 9 (lower right): White spiral/angular '9' design with nine angles marked, labeled '9 Angles'. Blue diagonal lines connect certain numbers suggesting relationships. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...) where each number sum of previous two. Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom text on beige border: 'NUMBERS AND GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES'. Diagram attempts to show mathematical patterns in number shapes, suggesting hidden geometry in numerical symbols. Concept related to sacred geometry and numerology popular in alternative cosmology communities. However, Arabic numeral shapes (0-9) are arbitrary cultural inventions - different writing systems use different symbols. Angle counting depends entirely on how digits are drawn15:T8ee,Grand Canyon sunrise photograph with flat Earth consciousness shift message. Inspirational landscape photograph featuring dramatic canyon vista with motivational text overlay. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'THE WORLD IS WAKING UP'. Second line in large bold white letters with black outline: 'KNOWING THE EARTH IS FLAT AND STATIONARY'. Image shows spectacular view of Grand Canyon at sunrise or sunset. Left foreground features massive red-orange layered sandstone cliff face with horizontal stratification visible - ancient geological formations showing millions of years of sedimentary deposits. Person in red clothing stands on rocky outcrop at cliff edge providing scale and contemplative silhouette against vast canyon. Canyon walls display characteristic red, orange, tan coloring from iron oxide in rocks. Deep canyon carved by Colorado River (visible as thin ribbon of yellowish water at bottom) cuts through landscape creating dramatic gorge approximately 1 mile deep. Opposite canyon rim visible in distance with flat-topped mesa formations showing same layered rock structure. Right side of image shows sun low on horizon creating golden sunburst effect with lens flare - rays of light radiating outward. Sky gradients from pale blue-gray at top to warm golden yellow-orange near horizon. Atmospheric haze creates layers of depth. Small tree visible on rocky outcrop. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'IS THE GREATEST CONSCIOUSNESS SHIFT IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY'. Message positions flat Earth acceptance as profound spiritual/intellectual awakening comparable to major paradigm shifts in human understanding. Implies humanity emerging from centuries of deception into enlightenment. However, understanding Earth as sphere represents actual historical consciousness shift (ancient Greeks ~500 BC measuring Earth's size, proving sphericity through observation). Reversion to flat Earth belief contradicts accumulated evidence from navigation, astronomy, physics, space exploration, photography, satellite communications, GPS, circumnavigation, and observations anyone can verify. Ironically, Grand Canyon's layered rock formations demonstrate deep time and geological processes over hundreds of millions of years9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-287","title":"Other 287","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734218_464902177042855_2692853735329290339_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-286","title":"Other 286","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734152_464902100376196_1665637751964474831_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-288","title":"Other 288","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/1273466_475707642628975_2769326555895483710_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
