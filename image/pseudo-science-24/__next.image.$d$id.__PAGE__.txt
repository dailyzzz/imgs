3:T47f,Two-panel meme featuring Carl Sagan quote about evidence standards. Top panel shows Carl Sagan in suit and tie smiling at camera with planets/space background (moons or planets visible). Quote in white text: '"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."' with attribution 'Carl Sagan' in lower right. Bottom panel shows animated/CGI diagram of heliocentric solar system model with large yellow Sun at center, multiple blue circular orbital paths with small planets, white motion trails showing orbital trajectories creating complex looping patterns, Earth visible as small blue sphere. Text 'MEES NOT FILMATIC' in lower right corner. Juxtaposes Sagan's famous skeptical quote with heliocentric model, implying that Earth orbiting Sun is extraordinary claim lacking extraordinary evidence. Ironically uses Sagan's own standard to challenge mainstream astronomy, suggesting heliocentric model should be questioned using same skeptical criteria Sagan advocated for pseudoscientific claims. Reverses Sagan's intended application - he used this principle to critique fringe theories, not established science with centuries of supporting evidence.4:T6cb,Educational infographic with bright blue background explaining Airy's Failure experiment and stellar aberration. Top shows white box with diagram labeled 'Fig. 2. The moving and stationary tubes (telescopes)' depicting two telescope configurations: left showing tilted telescope labeled 'Velocity of Rain = (>=speed of starlight)' with 'Tilt angle' and 'Moving tube (Earth's motion)' marked as diagram A; right showing vertical telescope labeled 'Stationary tube - (geocentric telescope)' with red text 'Water filled telescope-starlight slowed down' marked as diagram B. Both show rain/light angle comparisons. Bottom text in white on blue: 'To see whether it is the telescope or the stars that are moving, all you have to do is to fill the telescope with water which greatly slows down the light when it is in the telescope. If it is the telescope that is moving, then you have to tip the telescope a little further because of the slower speed of the light in the telescope. However, if it is the stars that are moving and you use a stationary telescope, then the telescope does NOT have to be tipped any further because the starlight is coming in at the correct angle anyway. THAT AIREY FAILED TO FIND ANY FURTHER TIPPING WAS NEEDED PROVED THAT IT WAS THE TELESCOPE AND THEREFORE THE EARTH THAT WAS STATIONARY. This important conclusion was not even mentioned in his report, it was too explosive!' Describes George Airy's 1871 water-filled telescope experiment testing stellar aberration, claiming it proved stationary Earth. Misinterprets results: experiment actually confirmed stellar aberration occurs as predicted for moving Earth due to light speed constancy, contradicting aether theory but supporting Earth's motion through space.5:T45a,Humorous meme about open-mindedness to opposing views with white background. Top text in black: 'Study finds that hearing an opposing viewpoint causes no real harm.' Below shows photograph of Asian scientist or researcher in white lab coat with light blue shirt and striped tie, sitting in laboratory/office setting with computer, equipment, microscopes visible in background. Researcher appears to be explaining something with hand gestures, water bottle on desk. Person in background working at desk. Satirical commentary suggesting that despite scientific evidence showing exposure to opposing viewpoints is harmless, many people act as if contrary opinions are dangerous or harmful. Can be interpreted as critique of echo chambers, intellectual fragility, or cancel culture. In flat Earth context, might be used to argue mainstream science refuses to consider alternative theories about Earth's shape, or conversely that flat Earthers should be open to globe Earth evidence. Meme format implies ironic disconnect between scientific findings about open dialogue and actual practice of dismissing opposing views.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-24","title":"Pseudo Science 24","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/36711022_1713312795383237_3071697611518902272_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-23","title":"Pseudo Science 23","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/34366417_1990712477637671_4202902588951101440_o.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-25","title":"Pseudo Science 25","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/37243155_1983072245036951_3882111060706066432_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
