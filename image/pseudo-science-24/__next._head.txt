5:T47f,Two-panel meme featuring Carl Sagan quote about evidence standards. Top panel shows Carl Sagan in suit and tie smiling at camera with planets/space background (moons or planets visible). Quote in white text: '"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."' with attribution 'Carl Sagan' in lower right. Bottom panel shows animated/CGI diagram of heliocentric solar system model with large yellow Sun at center, multiple blue circular orbital paths with small planets, white motion trails showing orbital trajectories creating complex looping patterns, Earth visible as small blue sphere. Text 'MEES NOT FILMATIC' in lower right corner. Juxtaposes Sagan's famous skeptical quote with heliocentric model, implying that Earth orbiting Sun is extraordinary claim lacking extraordinary evidence. Ironically uses Sagan's own standard to challenge mainstream astronomy, suggesting heliocentric model should be questioned using same skeptical criteria Sagan advocated for pseudoscientific claims. Reverses Sagan's intended application - he used this principle to critique fringe theories, not established science with centuries of supporting evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 24 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel meme featuring Carl Sagan quote about evidence standards.
