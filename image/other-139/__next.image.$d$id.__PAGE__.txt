3:T560,Grid collage of 8 different NASA Earth photographs from various years questioning inconsistencies in Earth's appearance. Black background. Top text in white: 'Come on NASA* make your mind up, what does the earth really look like?' Images arranged in two rows of 4. Top row: 1975 (pale blue marble with swirling white clouds, brown landmasses), 2015 (Blue Marble with bright blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents), 2007 (deep blue with white cloud swirls, green-brown land), 1997 (vivid blue with bright white clouds, green continents). Bottom row: 2007 (darker tones, brown Australia prominent), 2013 (pale appearance with white clouds, visible Africa/Europe), 2012 (bright blue with Americas visible), 2002 (deep blue with green landmasses). Right side label 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom text: '*ALL IMAGES ARE OFFICIAL NASA PICTURES OF EARTH, AS RELEASED THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS AND MAJOR NEWS AGENCIES OF THE WORLD. QUESTIONS: HOW BIG IS AMERICA? WHAT COLOUR ARE THE OCEANS, AND THE LAND? WHY IS THERE NEVER ANY REAL VIDEO OF THE EARTH SPINNING, ONLY STILLS? WHY ARE THE IMAGES SO VARIED? DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?' Points out dramatic variations in continent sizes, ocean colors (pale blue to deep blue), cloud coverage, and land tones across different NASA releases, questioning authenticity and consistency of space photography0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-139","title":"Other 139","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12376347_455442577988815_8038186525824614749_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-138","title":"Other 138","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12375116_446583322208074_4764068951087523623_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist photograph of Antarctic ice landscape with bold text overlay. Shows vast expanse of white snow and ice extending to horizon under clear blue sky transitioning from deep blue at top to lighter blue near horizon. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations and ridges creating texture across snowy terrain. Harsh sunlight creates shadows emphasizing ice formations. Horizon line appears straight and level where ice meets sky. Large bold white text in center reads 'ANTARCTICA IS FLAT' in impact font with black outline. Simple direct message using photographic evidence of Antarctic terrain appearing flat to naked eye. Argues ground-level view of Antarctica shows no curvature, supporting flat Earth model. Image emphasizes observable flatness of ice shelf/landscape despite Antarctica's position on spherical Earth's bottom in mainstream model. Uses stark minimalist composition to make bold declarative statement about continent's topography"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-140","title":"Other 140","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12400440_474572882742451_3281648999363055001_n.jpg","description":"Black and white NASA Earth photograph with parody text overlay. Shows monochrome spherical Earth image against black space background. Earth displays swirling white cloud formations, dark landmasses, and varying gray tones across surface. White box overlay in center contains bold text: 'STRAIGHT OUTTA PHOTOSHOP' in stacked format mimicking 'Straight Outta Compton' logo style from N.W.A. album/movie. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Parody suggests NASA Earth photographs are digitally manipulated in Adobe Photoshop rather than authentic space photography. Uses popular culture reference (hip-hop album cover format) to make accusation of photo manipulation accessible and memorable. Implies Earth images are computer-generated composites or CGI rather than real photographs taken from space. Questions authenticity of all NASA imagery by suggesting it comes directly from photo editing software"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
