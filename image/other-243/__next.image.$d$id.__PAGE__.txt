3:T570,Close-up orange tabby cat with wide eyes and NASA authority meme. Shows extreme close-up photograph of orange/ginger tabby cat's face filling entire frame. Cat has large round eyes with black pupils dilated wide, creating startled or concerned expression. Eyes reflect light showing bright white highlights. Fur shows typical tabby markings - orange-tan with darker orange stripes on forehead forming 'M' pattern. Pink nose visible at bottom center. White whiskers extend from sides. Fur appears soft and well-lit showing texture. Background slightly blurred showing reddish-brown tones. Right side displays 'flat earth matters' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'BUT NASA SAID SO'. Image uses cute concerned cat expression to mock appeal to NASA authority. Suggests people accept NASA claims without question simply because of institutional authority rather than evaluating evidence independently. Cat's worried expression represents someone confronted with evidence contradicting official narrative but still deferring to authority figure. Format similar to other animal reaction memes expressing cognitive dissonance or uncomfortable truths. Implies NASA statements are treated as infallible despite potential for errors or deception. Encourages viewers to question authority and trust personal observation over institutional claims4:T5d3,Pythagorean theorem diagram calculating Earth curvature at 3,959 mile radius. Shows technical geometric illustration proving curvature calculation using AutoCAD 2015. Title at top: 'PYTHAGOREAN PROOF OF CURVATURE FOR A BALL WITH A RADIUS OF 3959 MILES (USING AutoCAD 2015 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Main diagram displays cross-section of Earth as circle with 3,959 mile radius marked. Faint background shows actual Earth photograph with clouds and blue oceans. Geometric lines and angles drawn showing Pythagorean right triangles formed between Earth's center, surface points at various distances. Left side lists 'MILES IN: THOUSANDS' with measurements from 0 to 5000 miles. Diagram shows sight lines from observer at surface extending tangent to horizon. Right side contains detailed data table with columns: 'Miles', 'Feet', 'Inches', 'Miles' showing calculated drop at various distances using Earth's curvature formula. Formula shown: '8 inches per mile squared'. Bottom sections show magnified views at '10X MAGNIFICATION' and '100X MAGNIFICATION' to demonstrate geometric precision. Yellow highlighted box displays 'EXCEL FORMULA: X=3959-(3959*(COS(ASIN(L/3959))))' for calculating drop. Credit shows 'SPACE TRIG DRAWING BY MKAING 01/26/15'. Standard calculation used by surveyors and engineers to account for Earth's curvature in long-distance measurements. Flat Earthers use this to test visibility - if landmarks remain visible beyond calculated drop, they claim no curvature exists5:T587,Two-panel Jurassic Park meme about Earth curvature dismissal. Shows scenes from Jurassic Park (1993) film in outdoor tropical setting with palm trees and thatched roof structures. Top panel shows two men at wooden picnic table. Left: man in red polo shirt and sunglasses. Right: larger man in colorful Hawaiian shirt with blue-pink-purple floral pattern, arms crossed, pointing and speaking with animated expression. Text overlay: 'THIS GUY'S SEEN THE CURVATURE HE'S SEEN IT!' Background shows greenery, wooden structures, tropical resort atmosphere. Bottom panel shows closer view of same scene. Left: partial view of man in red shirt. Right: same Hawaiian-shirted man now with dismissive expression, glasses visible, gesturing with hand in 'whatever' motion. Watermark visible: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SEE? NOBODY CARES'. References famous Jurassic Park scene where Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) dismisses John Hammond's concerns. Original scene: 'See? Nobody cares' about Dodgson's identity. Meme repurposes dialogue to mock claims of seeing Earth's curvature. Suggests even if someone claims to have observed curvature, flat Earth community dismisses it as irrelevant or fabricated. Implies personal testimony about curvature carries no weight. Uses humor to deflect mainstream evidence while reinforcing in-group consensus that curvature is unobservable0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-243","title":"Other 243","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688065_461821374017602_6183272085537145209_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-242","title":"Other 242","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687931_463064537226619_4125492635927836346_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-244","title":"Other 244","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688256_462427670623639_8418095521325847670_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
