5:T570,Close-up orange tabby cat with wide eyes and NASA authority meme. Shows extreme close-up photograph of orange/ginger tabby cat's face filling entire frame. Cat has large round eyes with black pupils dilated wide, creating startled or concerned expression. Eyes reflect light showing bright white highlights. Fur shows typical tabby markings - orange-tan with darker orange stripes on forehead forming 'M' pattern. Pink nose visible at bottom center. White whiskers extend from sides. Fur appears soft and well-lit showing texture. Background slightly blurred showing reddish-brown tones. Right side displays 'flat earth matters' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'BUT NASA SAID SO'. Image uses cute concerned cat expression to mock appeal to NASA authority. Suggests people accept NASA claims without question simply because of institutional authority rather than evaluating evidence independently. Cat's worried expression represents someone confronted with evidence contradicting official narrative but still deferring to authority figure. Format similar to other animal reaction memes expressing cognitive dissonance or uncomfortable truths. Implies NASA statements are treated as infallible despite potential for errors or deception. Encourages viewers to question authority and trust personal observation over institutional claims0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 243 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Close-up orange tabby cat with wide eyes and NASA authority meme.
