3:Tde1,Composite meme image arguing water reflections prove flat Earth, divided into two sections. Top section shows dramatic nighttime urban street photography of wet pavement reflecting city lights - vibrant streaks of red, orange, yellow, blue, and pink light from traffic signals, car headlights/taillights, and street lighting create vivid mirror-like reflections on rain-soaked asphalt. Pedestrians with umbrellas and vehicles visible in motion-blurred cityscape scene. Text overlays: "REFLECTIONS ON A FLAT SURFACE" at top and "IT CAN'T HAPPEN ON A CURVE" in middle. Bottom section contains three side-by-side photographs of sunset/sunrise over ocean showing sun's reflection on water creating vertical columnar light path. Left image: sunset with orange sun low on horizon creating straight vertical reflection column on calm water. Center image: brighter daytime sun over ocean with prominent vertical reflection pillar extending down to shoreline waves. Right image: orange sunset with sun's reflection creating long vertical light streak on water surface. All three ocean images demonstrate same phenomenon - sun reflecting off water creates elongated vertical line of light stretching from sun to observer, classic specular reflection on rippled water surface. Photographer credit: "Nick Havok" on top image, "fb.com/fematters" attribution on left image. Argument claims that mirror-like reflections on water prove water surface must be flat, and that such reflections would be impossible on curved surface. This reasoning employs localized observation error - while Earth is spherical, any small section of surface appears flat at human scale due to planet's enormous size (7,917 mile diameter). Logic flaw: Meme conflates "locally flat" with "globally flat." Scientific explanation of reflections: Water surface creating reflections need only be locally smooth to act as mirror - curvature at planetary scale (8 inches per mile squared) is completely irrelevant to reflection physics at scales of city streets or ocean horizons visible to observer. Wet pavement in urban photo is obviously locally flat (manufactured road surface), but this says nothing about Earth's overall shape - by same logic, flat tabletop would "prove" Earth is flat. Ocean reflection images show specular reflection on rippled surface: columnar shape results from fact that waves present constantly changing angles of microscopic "mirrors" (water surface facets), and only those wavelets oriented at correct angle to reflect sun toward observer contribute to visible reflection, creating characteristic vertical pillar. This effect occurs because observer-sun-water geometry means reflective facets must lie along straight line between observer and sun, creating column appearance regardless of Earth's curvature. On perfectly spherical Earth with calm water, sun's reflection would still appear as column because only surface points along observer-sun axis can reflect light to observer's eyes. Horizon distance from sea level observer is approximately 3 miles - within this distance, Earth's curvature drops only 6 feet, far too subtle to affect visible reflection patterns. Curvature becomes irrelevant at scale of wave heights (inches to feet) that determine reflection characteristics. Additionally, photographs use long exposure/compression that enhances reflection column appearance. Conclusion: Reflections demonstrate only that local water surface sections are smooth enough to reflect light (whether flat or curved), not that entire Earth surface is flat plane.4:Tad1,Bowling alley photograph showing tall vertical stack of colorful bowling balls balanced precariously on white surface with man in dark polo shirt and khaki shorts standing with arms crossed in background. Text overlay at top states "SUPPOSEDLY SPINNING 1000 MPH" and bottom text declares "YET IS COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS". Sign visible behind bowling balls reads "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" (parody of Black Lives Matter movement). Stack consists of approximately 9-10 bowling balls in various colors: blue, orange, purple, green, dark green, yellow, orange, green, dark blue/purple, red arranged vertically from bottom to top. Interior bowling alley setting shows typical features: drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting panels, pool table rules sign partially visible on wall ("No sitting on..." text fragment visible), tables and chairs, TV screen mounted on wall in background, casual recreational facility environment. Image presents classic flat Earth argument that if Earth were truly rotating at approximately 1,000 mph at equator (actual equatorial rotation speed is 1,037 mph, decreasing toward poles), we should feel this motion, and objects would be unable to remain balanced or stationary. Argument fundamentally misunderstands basic physics principle of inertial reference frames and constant velocity motion. Scientific rebuttal: Bowling balls, building, and all objects on Earth share same rotational velocity, moving together with Earth's surface - there is no relative motion between objects and ground. This is identical to why airplane passengers can walk normally in cabin of jet traveling 500+ mph - everything inside plane shares plane's velocity. Motion is only perceptible when there is acceleration (change in speed or direction). Earth's rotation is constant velocity motion (one rotation per 24 hours), so there is no acceleration felt by objects on surface. Additionally, while equatorial rotation speed is ~1,000 mph, this represents only one rotation per day - incredibly slow angular velocity (0.0007 rpm). For comparison, Earth's orbital velocity around sun is 67,000 mph, and solar system moves through galaxy at 514,000 mph, yet we perceive none of these motions because they're constant velocity. Bowling balls remain stacked because gravity (9.8 m/s² downward acceleration) holds them in place relative to Earth's surface, and all objects share Earth's rotational momentum. Centrifugal force from Earth's rotation is real but minuscule compared to gravity - only about 0.3% of gravitational force at equator, already factored into what we measure as "gravity." Image exemplifies fundamental misunderstanding: conflating high velocity with perceptibility, ignoring that constant motion is imperceptible in absence of external reference frame.5:Tde6,Elaborate flat Earth cosmology digital artwork composite depicting dome model with space as fabrication. Complex fantasy illustration showing flat Earth believers' cosmological worldview. Center features circular flat Earth disc showing recognizable continental landmasses - North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia arranged on flat plane surrounded by concentric circles creating target-like pattern. Blue water covers flat disc surface with green/yellow continents. Disc appears to be physical platform or stage set. Outer rim shows white/ice barrier (Antarctic ice wall) containing oceans. Surrounding flat Earth disc are crowds of small human figures arranged in circular formation around edge, suggesting audience or observers watching staged performance. Space shuttle visible in upper left flying through purple/blue nebula clouds bears text "NASSHOLES" on fuselage - explicit mockery of NASA space agency, suggesting space program is hoax or deception. Cosmic background shows vibrant purple, blue, pink, and cyan nebula clouds with stars scattered throughout, creating dreamy fantasy atmosphere rather than realistic space. Two figures (possibly astronauts or travelers) stand on elevated platform or hill in upper center, silhouetted against colorful sky, appearing to oversee flat Earth model below. Right foreground shows close-up of astronaut in white EVA spacesuit with large reflective helmet visor, American flag visible on shoulder, NASA logo patch on chest. Helmet visor shows golden/brown reflection. Spacesuit highly detailed with white fabric layers, mechanical joints, life support equipment. Astronaut positioned as if floating or standing at edge of flat Earth platform, perspective suggests they're part of elaborate stage show or set piece rather than actual space explorer. Lower left shows "DDees.com" attribution - likely David Dees, artist known for conspiracy theory illustrations. Artwork embodies multiple flat Earth concepts: 1) Earth as flat circular disc rather than sphere, 2) Space as theatrical fabrication rather than reality, 3) NASA as deceptive organization creating illusion of space travel, 4) Firmament or dome concept suggested by enclosed theatrical setting, 5) Antarctica as ice wall containing world's oceans at edge. Image designed to visually represent conspiracy theory that space agencies fake space exploration using studio sets, green screens, and CGI, with astronauts as actors rather than explorers. Artistic style is surreal fantasy composite blending photographic elements with digital painting. Vibrant nebula background serves dual purpose: creating visually striking image while suggesting "outer space" depicted in NASA imagery is artificial creation rather than photographed reality. Crowds surrounding edge could represent general population as spectators to grand deception, unaware they're watching staged performance rather than genuine scientific achievement. This type of imagery popular in flat Earth communities as artistic expression of belief system, though it represents misunderstanding of extensive evidence for spherical Earth: satellite imagery, GPS systems, international flights, amateur high-altitude balloon footage, ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different star constellations visible from different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect, photographs from ISS, testimony from astronauts of multiple nations including Cold War adversaries. Image is digital art/propaganda rather than documentation of reality.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-332","title":"Other 332","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799340_469031719963234_2161137336816822350_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-331","title":"Other 331","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799328_468744459991960_7273001810409829341_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-333","title":"Other 333","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799383_470962946436778_4911407046286868769_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
