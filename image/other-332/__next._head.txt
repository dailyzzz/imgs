5:Tde1,Composite meme image arguing water reflections prove flat Earth, divided into two sections. Top section shows dramatic nighttime urban street photography of wet pavement reflecting city lights - vibrant streaks of red, orange, yellow, blue, and pink light from traffic signals, car headlights/taillights, and street lighting create vivid mirror-like reflections on rain-soaked asphalt. Pedestrians with umbrellas and vehicles visible in motion-blurred cityscape scene. Text overlays: "REFLECTIONS ON A FLAT SURFACE" at top and "IT CAN'T HAPPEN ON A CURVE" in middle. Bottom section contains three side-by-side photographs of sunset/sunrise over ocean showing sun's reflection on water creating vertical columnar light path. Left image: sunset with orange sun low on horizon creating straight vertical reflection column on calm water. Center image: brighter daytime sun over ocean with prominent vertical reflection pillar extending down to shoreline waves. Right image: orange sunset with sun's reflection creating long vertical light streak on water surface. All three ocean images demonstrate same phenomenon - sun reflecting off water creates elongated vertical line of light stretching from sun to observer, classic specular reflection on rippled water surface. Photographer credit: "Nick Havok" on top image, "fb.com/fematters" attribution on left image. Argument claims that mirror-like reflections on water prove water surface must be flat, and that such reflections would be impossible on curved surface. This reasoning employs localized observation error - while Earth is spherical, any small section of surface appears flat at human scale due to planet's enormous size (7,917 mile diameter). Logic flaw: Meme conflates "locally flat" with "globally flat." Scientific explanation of reflections: Water surface creating reflections need only be locally smooth to act as mirror - curvature at planetary scale (8 inches per mile squared) is completely irrelevant to reflection physics at scales of city streets or ocean horizons visible to observer. Wet pavement in urban photo is obviously locally flat (manufactured road surface), but this says nothing about Earth's overall shape - by same logic, flat tabletop would "prove" Earth is flat. Ocean reflection images show specular reflection on rippled surface: columnar shape results from fact that waves present constantly changing angles of microscopic "mirrors" (water surface facets), and only those wavelets oriented at correct angle to reflect sun toward observer contribute to visible reflection, creating characteristic vertical pillar. This effect occurs because observer-sun-water geometry means reflective facets must lie along straight line between observer and sun, creating column appearance regardless of Earth's curvature. On perfectly spherical Earth with calm water, sun's reflection would still appear as column because only surface points along observer-sun axis can reflect light to observer's eyes. Horizon distance from sea level observer is approximately 3 miles - within this distance, Earth's curvature drops only 6 feet, far too subtle to affect visible reflection patterns. Curvature becomes irrelevant at scale of wave heights (inches to feet) that determine reflection characteristics. Additionally, photographs use long exposure/compression that enhances reflection column appearance. Conclusion: Reflections demonstrate only that local water surface sections are smooth enough to reflect light (whether flat or curved), not that entire Earth surface is flat plane.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 332 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Composite meme image arguing water reflections prove flat Earth, divided into two sections.
