3:T63b,Antarctic tabular ice shelf with geometric cliff faces meeting dark ocean. Shows stunning aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf from elevated viewpoint. Lower right foreground displays pristine white snow-covered ice shelf surface extending across bottom of frame - flat geometric plane with slight undulations and surface textures visible. Most dramatic feature is massive vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets ocean - clean straight edge running across image showing sheer drop from flat top surface to water level. Ice cliff appears 50-100 feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified horizontal layers of compressed ice and snow in brilliant white and pale blue bands. Wall face shows some irregularities, cracks, overhangs, and icicle-like formations along edge where ice has partially calved. Left side and upper portion shows dark teal-blue ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, and small white icebergs floating on surface creating textured pattern. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast against bright white ice. Middle distance shows larger tabular icebergs and ice floes in various sizes. Far background displays distant ice shelf formations extending to horizon. Sky shows light blue-gray gradient suggesting overcast polar conditions. Bottom left corner shows 'www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk' watermark indicating British Antarctic Survey photography. No other text visible. Professional nature documentation. Image used by flat Earth proponents as visual representation of alleged Antarctic ice wall surrounding flat Earth disc perimeter4:T5fa,Training Day meme mocking gravitational waves discovery with Denzel Washington. Shows scene from Training Day (2001) film inside vehicle. Denzel Washington as Detective Alonzo Harris in driver's seat, wearing dark clothing. Has short hair, thin mustache and goatee, looking toward camera with skeptical questioning expression - eyebrows slightly raised, mouth open mid-speech. Hand visible gesturing. Background shows blurred vehicle interior with gray upholstery, window showing out-of-focus exterior with orange/tan and blue tones suggesting daytime street scene. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THEY TOLD YOU THEY FOUND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Right side displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in white bold letters: 'AND YOU BELIEVE THAT SHIT?' References 2016 LIGO announcement of first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, confirming Einstein's century-old prediction. Flat Earth community dismisses gravitational waves as unverifiable theoretical physics rather than empirical science. Uses Denzel Washington's street-smart, skeptical character to question scientific establishment narratives. Training Day scene originally about exposing naivety. Meme suggests mainstream audience credulously accepts scientific announcements without understanding underlying theory or considering alternative explanations. Implies gravitational wave detection could be fabricated data or misinterpreted instrument noise rather than genuine cosmic phenomenon5:T5c9,Missing milk carton parody featuring Earth's missing curvature. Shows 3D rendered illustration of classic red and white milk carton design against plain white background. Carton displays traditional gable-top shape with triangular peaked roof and small rectangular tab at top. Left side panel shows vertical red and white stripes with large red text 'MILK' repeated vertically. Front panel features missing person poster format with red header 'MISSING' at top. Below header shows black band with white text 'CURVATURE'. Center displays photograph of Earth from space - classic Blue Marble style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents visible against black space background. Bottom right of photo shows 'JM' signature watermark. Below photo, red text reads 'Have you Seen me?' in friendly font. Lower section contains mock missing person details in black italicized text: 'LAST SPOTTED ON NEVER' with 'NEVER' emphasized. Next line: 'IF FOUND: PLEASE CONTACT NASA' with 'NASA' in capital letters. Final line: 'REWARD: CREDIBILITY' with 'CREDIBILITY' in capital letters. Left panel shows vertical text reading 'HOMOGENIZED PASTEURIZED' in red. Satirical image mocks inability to observe Earth's curvature from ground level despite spherical Earth model. Suggests curvature is theoretical construct never actually witnessed in reality. 'Reward: Credibility' implies finding observable curvature would restore NASA's trustworthiness0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-247","title":"Other 247","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697381_461770147356058_5884868133883643800_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-246","title":"Other 246","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12697225_465616066971466_1180502624568548152_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-248","title":"Other 248","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698243_464898840376522_6791307062651726646_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
