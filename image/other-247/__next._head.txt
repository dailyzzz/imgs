5:T63b,Antarctic tabular ice shelf with geometric cliff faces meeting dark ocean. Shows stunning aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf from elevated viewpoint. Lower right foreground displays pristine white snow-covered ice shelf surface extending across bottom of frame - flat geometric plane with slight undulations and surface textures visible. Most dramatic feature is massive vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets ocean - clean straight edge running across image showing sheer drop from flat top surface to water level. Ice cliff appears 50-100 feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified horizontal layers of compressed ice and snow in brilliant white and pale blue bands. Wall face shows some irregularities, cracks, overhangs, and icicle-like formations along edge where ice has partially calved. Left side and upper portion shows dark teal-blue ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, and small white icebergs floating on surface creating textured pattern. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast against bright white ice. Middle distance shows larger tabular icebergs and ice floes in various sizes. Far background displays distant ice shelf formations extending to horizon. Sky shows light blue-gray gradient suggesting overcast polar conditions. Bottom left corner shows 'www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk' watermark indicating British Antarctic Survey photography. No other text visible. Professional nature documentation.
