Shows beautiful sunset photograph over ocean with bright white-yellow sun low on horizon, golden reflection path stretching across dark reddish-brown water toward viewer. Sky displays dramatic gradient from warm peachy-yellow near sun through deeper orange to reddish-brown tones higher up with layered clouds. Top white text reads 'Only lifelong indoctrination can make a person see a sunset like this' and bottom text states 'And still believe we live on this!' with inset spherical Earth image (showing Americas, white clouds, blue oceans) in lower right corner. Argues that accepting spherical Earth despite observing flat horizon at sunset requires cultural conditioning/indoctrination rather than direct observation. Suggests visual evidence of flat horizon contradicts sphere model, implying people have been taught to ignore sensory evidence in favor of heliocentric worldview"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-28","title":"The Sun 28","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36873932_1917093435247981_5668267923366477824_n.jpeg","description":"Educational meme with black background questioning heliocentric model's etymology. Top section contains white text: 'Heliocentric is the model where the earth goes around the sun. The term was first used by the Pathagorean cult in 200 BC after it returned to Greece from Egypt. Helios in the ancient Egyptian is Horus, the sun god. Centric means center. So heliocentric means centered on the god Horus. We are being taught a 2200 year old cultic, math worshiping religion as science.' Bottom section shows large red text 'And this doesn't concern you at all?' alongside orrery-style physical model with yellow sun sphere, green/turquoise planetary spheres on wire orbital paths mounted on stand. References provided: 'http://www.edenics.net/english-word-origins.aspx?word=HELIOCENTRIC' and 'http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html'. Argues heliocentric model has occult/religious origins tied to ancient Egyptian sun worship, suggesting scientific astronomy is disguised paganism rather than empirical science"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-30","title":"The Sun 30","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/37203617_10205036660591760_6481028739684630528_n-1.jpeg","description":"Comparison meme using perspective analogy to explain flat Earth sunset model. Left side shows perspective view down yellow-lit institutional hallway/corridor with red vertical pipes/railings along walls, receding ceiling lights creating vanishing point effect. Right side shows inset photograph labeled 'SUN TRAIL' displaying diagonal bright light streak across sky during sunset (likely long-exposure time-lapse), photo credit 'Nick Havok'. Top white text asks 'HOW DOES A SUNSET WORK IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?' Bottom text explains 'AS THE SUN MOVES AWAY, DUE TO PERSPECTIVE ON A PLANE IT APPEARS TO DROP DOWN AS IT CONVERGES AT THE VANISHING POINT'. Uses hallway perspective (where parallel lines appear to converge and drop) to demonstrate how sun moving horizontally away on flat plane would appear to descend toward horizon due to perspective laws, similar to how hallway ceiling appears to lower at distance.
