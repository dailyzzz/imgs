Shows beautiful sunset photograph over ocean with bright white-yellow sun low on horizon, golden reflection path stretching across dark reddish-brown water toward viewer. Sky displays dramatic gradient from warm peachy-yellow near sun through deeper orange to reddish-brown tones higher up with layered clouds. Top white text reads 'Only lifelong indoctrination can make a person see a sunset like this' and bottom text states 'And still believe we live on this!' with inset spherical Earth image (showing Americas, white clouds, blue oceans) in lower right corner. Argues that accepting spherical Earth despite observing flat horizon at sunset requires cultural conditioning/indoctrination rather than direct observation. Suggests visual evidence of flat horizon contradicts sphere model, implying people have been taught to ignore sensory evidence in favor of heliocentric worldview"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Sun 29"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Philosophical meme questioning perception and belief about Earth's shape using sunset imagery.
