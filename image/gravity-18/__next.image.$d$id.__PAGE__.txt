Below in large elegant script: 'Sincerely yours, the cherry picked Jesuit fraud: Sir Isaac Newton' with hashtag '#VaticanFraudInc'. Alleges Newton was Jesuit agent who fraudulently invented gravity concept without understanding electromagnetism (discovered later) or conducting experiments. Claims Newton's work was selectively promoted by Vatican to advance false cosmology.

Quote in black text reads: 'Einstein's relativity work is a magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king.. its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists.' Attribution: '— Nikola Tesla —' with 'AZ QUOTES' logo below. Tesla criticizes Einstein's relativity theory (including gravity as spacetime curvature) as mathematically impressive but fundamentally flawed, dressed up to appear legitimate. Suggests relativity physicists are philosophers rather than empirical scientists.

Top text in bold white and orange: 'WHEN METAL IS HEATED IT LOSES ITS MAGNETIC PROPERTIES' with Discovery News logo. Center shows Blue Marble Earth photo and cutaway diagram of Earth's interior layers (crust, mantle, outer core in red/orange, inner core in yellow) with glowing heated appearance. Bottom text in white: 'GRAVITY DEPENDS ON THE THEORY OF MAGNETISM GENERATED BY A SUPER HEATED MOLTEN METAL INNER CORE.' with 'edgp.com' watermark. Argues logical contradiction: if heated metal loses magnetism (Curie point), Earth's molten metal core cannot generate magnetic field, yet gravity theory supposedly depends on Earth's magnetic core. Actually conflates two separate phenomena - gravity (mass attraction) and magnetism (electromagnetic field) - which mainstream science treats as distinct forces"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":"$L4"}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
