5:T5d3,Pythagorean theorem diagram calculating Earth curvature at 3,959 mile radius. Shows technical geometric illustration proving curvature calculation using AutoCAD 2015. Title at top: 'PYTHAGOREAN PROOF OF CURVATURE FOR A BALL WITH A RADIUS OF 3959 MILES (USING AutoCAD 2015 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Main diagram displays cross-section of Earth as circle with 3,959 mile radius marked. Faint background shows actual Earth photograph with clouds and blue oceans. Geometric lines and angles drawn showing Pythagorean right triangles formed between Earth's center, surface points at various distances. Left side lists 'MILES IN: THOUSANDS' with measurements from 0 to 5000 miles. Diagram shows sight lines from observer at surface extending tangent to horizon. Right side contains detailed data table with columns: 'Miles', 'Feet', 'Inches', 'Miles' showing calculated drop at various distances using Earth's curvature formula. Formula shown: '8 inches per mile squared'. Bottom sections show magnified views at '10X MAGNIFICATION' and '100X MAGNIFICATION' to demonstrate geometric precision. Yellow highlighted box displays 'EXCEL FORMULA: X=3959-(3959*(COS(ASIN(L/3959))))' for calculating drop. Credit shows 'SPACE TRIG DRAWING BY MKAING 01/26/15'. Standard calculation used by surveyors and engineers to account for Earth's curvature in long-distance measurements. Flat Earthers use this to test visibility - if landmarks remain visible beyond calculated drop, they claim no curvature exists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 242 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Pythagorean theorem diagram calculating Earth curvature at 3,959 mile radius.
