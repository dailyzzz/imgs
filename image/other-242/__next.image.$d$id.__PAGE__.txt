3:T5d3,Pythagorean theorem diagram calculating Earth curvature at 3,959 mile radius. Shows technical geometric illustration proving curvature calculation using AutoCAD 2015. Title at top: 'PYTHAGOREAN PROOF OF CURVATURE FOR A BALL WITH A RADIUS OF 3959 MILES (USING AutoCAD 2015 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Main diagram displays cross-section of Earth as circle with 3,959 mile radius marked. Faint background shows actual Earth photograph with clouds and blue oceans. Geometric lines and angles drawn showing Pythagorean right triangles formed between Earth's center, surface points at various distances. Left side lists 'MILES IN: THOUSANDS' with measurements from 0 to 5000 miles. Diagram shows sight lines from observer at surface extending tangent to horizon. Right side contains detailed data table with columns: 'Miles', 'Feet', 'Inches', 'Miles' showing calculated drop at various distances using Earth's curvature formula. Formula shown: '8 inches per mile squared'. Bottom sections show magnified views at '10X MAGNIFICATION' and '100X MAGNIFICATION' to demonstrate geometric precision. Yellow highlighted box displays 'EXCEL FORMULA: X=3959-(3959*(COS(ASIN(L/3959))))' for calculating drop. Credit shows 'SPACE TRIG DRAWING BY MKAING 01/26/15'. Standard calculation used by surveyors and engineers to account for Earth's curvature in long-distance measurements. Flat Earthers use this to test visibility - if landmarks remain visible beyond calculated drop, they claim no curvature exists4:T601,Gravitron carnival ride demonstrating centrifugal force opposite of gravity. Shows carnival amusement park ride in action. Large circular spinning ride called Gravitron with distinctive UFO/flying saucer appearance - silver-gray metallic dome with light blue accents and red trim bands. Decorative lights create retro sci-fi aesthetic. Top displays arched red sign reading 'GRAVITRON' in illuminated letters. Structure supported by yellow metal framework and safety barriers. Below, riders pressed against padded walls inside spinning chamber - centrifugal force pins them to perimeter as floor drops away. Visible riders wearing winter clothing (jackets, hoodies) stuck to red padded sections. One person in striped clothing, others in solid colors. Crowd visible at ground level watching. Background shows light blue evening sky with power lines. Middle text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE FASTER IT SPINS, THE MORE YOU STICK TO THE WALL'. Bottom text: 'PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF HOW GRAVITY IS SUPPOSED TO WORK'. Bottom right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph at equator, centrifugal force should fling objects outward away from surface, opposite of gravitational attraction pulling inward. However, Earth's rotation creates minimal centrifugal force compared to gravity due to large radius. At equator, centrifugal acceleration is only 0.03 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s². Gravitron spins much faster in tight radius creating noticeable outward force5:T570,Close-up orange tabby cat with wide eyes and NASA authority meme. Shows extreme close-up photograph of orange/ginger tabby cat's face filling entire frame. Cat has large round eyes with black pupils dilated wide, creating startled or concerned expression. Eyes reflect light showing bright white highlights. Fur shows typical tabby markings - orange-tan with darker orange stripes on forehead forming 'M' pattern. Pink nose visible at bottom center. White whiskers extend from sides. Fur appears soft and well-lit showing texture. Background slightly blurred showing reddish-brown tones. Right side displays 'flat earth matters' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'BUT NASA SAID SO'. Image uses cute concerned cat expression to mock appeal to NASA authority. Suggests people accept NASA claims without question simply because of institutional authority rather than evaluating evidence independently. Cat's worried expression represents someone confronted with evidence contradicting official narrative but still deferring to authority figure. Format similar to other animal reaction memes expressing cognitive dissonance or uncomfortable truths. Implies NASA statements are treated as infallible despite potential for errors or deception. Encourages viewers to question authority and trust personal observation over institutional claims0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-242","title":"Other 242","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687931_463064537226619_4125492635927836346_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-241","title":"Other 241","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12687911_460794420786964_5550253741581559752_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-243","title":"Other 243","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688065_461821374017602_6183272085537145209_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
