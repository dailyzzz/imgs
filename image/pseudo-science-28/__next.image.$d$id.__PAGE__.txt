3:T4d1,Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing glasses and priest's collar, standing at chalkboard with mathematical equations and diagrams. Top text in large white letters: 'OH, YOU LIKE THE BIG BANG THEORY?' Chalkboard shows cosmological calculations with symbols including 'e', 'M', and arrow. Bottom text in large white letters: 'THANK A CATHOLIC PRIEST' with 'quickmeme.com' watermark. Meme highlights that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître in 1927, suggesting religious origin undermines theory's scientific credibility. Often used to argue modern cosmology is religious dogma rather than empirical science, or that Catholic Church controls scientific narrative. Ironically, Lemaître was accomplished physicist whose theory was initially met with skepticism but later confirmed by observational evidence (cosmic microwave background, galactic redshift). His priesthood and scientific work were separate domains. Meme implies religious affiliation invalidates scientific contributions, ad hominem fallacy attacking messenger rather than addressing evidence for expanding universe model.4:T625,Quote meme showing elderly scientist or professor in formal dark suit with blue tie standing in front of white background covered with handwritten mathematical equations, integrals, logarithms, and calculus formulas. Man has white hair, gesturing with both hands raised as if explaining or lecturing. Wooden desk/podium on left side. Surrounding him are complex mathematical expressions including integrals (∫), logarithms (log₂), trigonometric functions (cos, sin), fractions, exponents, square roots. Bottom quote in black text: '"Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."' Attribution: '-Nikola Tesla'. Quote criticizes modern theoretical physics for relying too heavily on mathematical abstraction rather than empirical experimentation, claiming mathematical models become divorced from physical reality. Used to argue contemporary science (particularly relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology) is purely theoretical construction without experimental basis. Context: Tesla was experimental physicist who favored hands-on laboratory work over theoretical mathematics. Quote reflects his methodological preference but oversimplifies relationship between theory and experiment in modern physics. Ironic given that Tesla's own electromagnetic work is described mathematically and many theoretical predictions (gravitational waves, Higgs boson, etc.) were later experimentally confirmed decades after mathematical prediction.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-28","title":"Pseudo Science 28","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/39777308_2016165451755295_6079616547830104064_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-27","title":"Pseudo Science 27","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/39027551_1827516517325001_442898797090045952_n.jpeg","description":"Meme using Renaissance portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus with dark background.
