5:T4d1,Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing glasses and priest's collar, standing at chalkboard with mathematical equations and diagrams. Top text in large white letters: 'OH, YOU LIKE THE BIG BANG THEORY?' Chalkboard shows cosmological calculations with symbols including 'e', 'M', and arrow. Bottom text in large white letters: 'THANK A CATHOLIC PRIEST' with 'quickmeme.com' watermark. Meme highlights that Big Bang theory was proposed by Catholic priest Georges Lemaître in 1927, suggesting religious origin undermines theory's scientific credibility. Often used to argue modern cosmology is religious dogma rather than empirical science, or that Catholic Church controls scientific narrative. Ironically, Lemaître was accomplished physicist whose theory was initially met with skepticism but later confirmed by observational evidence (cosmic microwave background, galactic redshift). His priesthood and scientific work were separate domains. Meme implies religious affiliation invalidates scientific contributions, ad hominem fallacy attacking messenger rather than addressing evidence for expanding universe model.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 28 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing gl..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Pseudo Science 28"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing gl..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/39777308_2016165451755295_6079616547830104064_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 28"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Conspiracy theory meme showing black and white photograph of Georges Lemaître, Belgian Catholic priest and physicist who proposed Big Bang theory, wearing gl..."}],"$L6"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
