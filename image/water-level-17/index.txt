13:T496,Dramatic waterfall photograph with philosophical text overlay questioning water physics on spherical Earth. Shows powerful waterfall (possibly Skógafoss in Iceland) cascading down between green moss-covered cliffs into pool below. Waterfall appears as wide white curtain of falling water. Sky displays spectacular sunset with vibrant orange, pink, purple and blue clouds creating dramatic backdrop. Mist rises from waterfall base. Text in white letters reads 'AT WHAT SCALE DOES WATER GAIN THE ABILITY TO CLING TO THE OUTSIDE OF A SPHERE?' Questions fundamental premise of spherical Earth by asking when water supposedly transitions from falling downward (as in waterfall, following gravity) to adhering to curved surface (as oceans allegedly do on globe). Argues that water demonstrably flows downward in all observable situations (waterfalls, rain, pouring), so at what point does it supposedly start clinging to outside of spinning sphere. Challenges mechanism by which water remains attached to spherical Earth despite observable tendency to fall downward, questioning gravity's ability to hold oceans to curved surface when water clearly falls freely in smaller scales14:T458,Breathtaking photograph of Bolivian Salt Flats with perfect mirror reflection during wet season. Top text reads 'THE #1 FLATTEST PLACE ON EARTH BECOMES A PERFECT MIRROR DURING ITS MONSOON SEASON!' Shows dramatic sky with mixture of golden-orange, pink, blue, and white clouds reflected absolutely perfectly in still water below. Small wooden boat sits in lower right, also perfectly mirrored in water. Sky and reflection create nearly perfect symmetry making it difficult to distinguish where sky ends and water begins. Vibrant sunset colors illuminate clouds creating spectacular display duplicated in water reflection. Bottom text states 'THIS IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE ON A BALL!' Argues that Salar de Uyuni's perfect mirror effect during rainy season (when thin layer of water covers vast salt flat) demonstrates impossibility of such reflections on curved surface. Claims that perfect symmetrical reflections visible across miles prove water surface is flat plane rather than curved. Questions how spherical Earth could produce such flawless large-scale mirror effects when curved surfaces distort reflections15:T43b,Two-panel educational diagram about ocean curvature and topography. Top panel labeled 'Aeolus' shows ship on flat water surface with vertical mast and antenna. Red line labeled 'Aeolus Line of Sight' extends diagonally from kite/balloon in upper right down to ship. Gray line labeled 'Ship Line of Sight' extends horizontally from ship across water. Light blue represents flat ocean surface with white clouds above. Demonstrates sight-line geometry argument. Bottom panel labeled 'Ocean Surface' shows cross-section of ocean floor topography with layers: light blue water at top with label 'Ocean Su-', dark blue deeper water labeled 'Continental Shelf' on left and 'Ocean Ridge' in center, brown/tan seafloor showing 'Abyssal Plain', 'Rift Valley', 'Seamount', and 'Trench' features with depth markers '10,000 ft.+' and '35,810 ft'. Text 'Curvature of the Earth' appears in bottom right. Diagram contrasts flat water surface assumption (top) with complex seafloor topography and supposed Earth curvature (bottom), questioning why water surface appears flat if Earth is curved sphere9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-17","title":"Water Level 17","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/40684463_10213267043050744_6471809802837164032_n.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-16","title":"Water Level 16","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/36850538_10216129449492722_4660206594682781696_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-18","title":"Water Level 18","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/40960977_2090828631169809_5626676125791944704_n.jpeg","description":"$15"}}]
