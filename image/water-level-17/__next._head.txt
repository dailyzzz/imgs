5:T496,Dramatic waterfall photograph with philosophical text overlay questioning water physics on spherical Earth. Shows powerful waterfall (possibly Skógafoss in Iceland) cascading down between green moss-covered cliffs into pool below. Waterfall appears as wide white curtain of falling water. Sky displays spectacular sunset with vibrant orange, pink, purple and blue clouds creating dramatic backdrop. Mist rises from waterfall base. Text in white letters reads 'AT WHAT SCALE DOES WATER GAIN THE ABILITY TO CLING TO THE OUTSIDE OF A SPHERE?' Questions fundamental premise of spherical Earth by asking when water supposedly transitions from falling downward (as in waterfall, following gravity) to adhering to curved surface (as oceans allegedly do on globe). Argues that water demonstrably flows downward in all observable situations (waterfalls, rain, pouring), so at what point does it supposedly start clinging to outside of spinning sphere. Challenges mechanism by which water remains attached to spherical Earth despite observable tendency to fall downward, questioning gravity's ability to hold oceans to curved surface when water clearly falls freely in smaller scales0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 17 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dramatic waterfall photograph with philosophical text overlay questioning water physics on spherical Earth.
