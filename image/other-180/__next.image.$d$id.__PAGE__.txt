3:T4fa,Salar de Uyuni salt flats perfect mirror with curvature question. Shows spectacular photograph of Bolivia's salt flats during rainy season. Thin layer of water creates flawless mirror reflection making sky and ground indistinguishable. Upper half shows dramatic cloudscape - brilliant blue sky with massive white and gray cumulus clouds scattered across. Darker storm clouds visible on left. Lower half shows perfect mirror reflection of entire sky scene in still water. Lone silhouetted figure walks across middle of frame, body and reflection creating symmetrical composition. Person appears to walk between two identical skies. Horizon line where actual sky meets reflection is nearly invisible. Salt flat extends in all directions appearing completely flat and level. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHERE DOES THE CURVE START?' Bottom right watermark 'thetrutherfactory'. Uses one of nature's most perfect mirror surfaces to question Earth's curvature. Argues if Earth curves, the perfectly flat mirror reflection extending for miles shouldn't be possible. Questions at what distance curvature should become visible. Salar de Uyuni spans 10,582 square kilometers - flat Earth proponents argue this vast flat surface contradicts spherical Earth model4:T52a,Two-panel cartoon of laughing globe Earth character reading flat Earth news. Left panel: anthropomorphized blue globe Earth with grid lines (latitude/longitude), white continents visible. Earth character has cartoon face with eyes, big grinning smile showing teeth, extended red tongue laughing. Blue arms hold newspaper titled 'DAILY NEWS' with headline: 'Yes There Are Still People Who Believe Earth Is Flat.' Globe tilted back laughing with motion lines showing shaking. Bottom right 'JM' logo on shirt/body. Right panel: Same globe character now shocked/horrified expression - wide open mouth screaming, bulging eyes, sweat drops flying off. Holds different newspaper titled 'BREAKING NEWS!' with headline 'For scientists to break off some EVIDENCE call us at NO!' Motion lines show violent shaking/trembling. Bottom right 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Satirical comic suggests mainstream/globe believers initially laugh at flat Earth but panic when asked for proof. Left panel represents confident ridicule of flat Earth believers. Right panel shows existential crisis when challenged to provide evidence for globe model. Argues those who mock flat Earth cannot defend their own beliefs when questioned. Implies cognitive dissonance when globe believers realize they accepted Earth's shape on faith without evidence5:T504,Apollo Lunar Module construction materials skepticism meme. Shows close-up photograph of Apollo LM (Lunar Module) in space or on moon with black space background. Module displays distinctive gold/bronze metallic thermal foil covering, angular geometric shape with flat panels, landing legs visible at bottom. Gray/silver structural elements, black shadows create harsh contrast. Module appears fragile, makeshift with wrinkled foil, exposed framework, various protrusions and antennae. Top text in bold white letters: 'NASA CLAIMS THEY WENT TO THE MOON IN THIS...' Bottom text: 'IF YOU ZOOM IN, YOU CAN SEE FOIL, TAPE, AND CURTAIN RODS.' Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skepticism questioning spacecraft's construction quality and materials. Mocks LM's appearance as flimsy, homemade-looking craft assembled from household materials. 'Curtain rods' reference disparages structural elements as looking like bathroom fixtures rather than space-grade engineering. Argues module appears too primitive/fragile to survive space travel, radiation, moon landing. Conspiracy theorists point to wrinkled foil and visible tape as evidence of studio prop rather than functional spacecraft. Questions how such apparently crude construction could withstand claimed journey0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-180","title":"Other 180","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12514038_454174674782272_4416362959406589445_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-179","title":"Other 179","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12513554_460155257517547_5025456840721782473_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-181","title":"Other 181","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12523054_455800094619730_8223789282222809336_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
