3:T490,Flat Earth cosmology diagram illustrating sea water currents and sun's circular path. Title at top: 'Sea water currents & The path of the sun above the flat earth'. Shows azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center. Continents shown in yellow-green (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. White arrows indicate circular current patterns: 'SOUTH PACIFIC GYRE' on left, 'NORTH PACIFIC GYRE' visible, 'SOUTH ATLANTIC' labeled, 'INDIAN OCEAN GYRE' on right. Sun's path shown as concentric circles: outer yellow circle labeled 'Tropic of Cancer' at top, inner red circle labeled 'NORTH/SOUTH' showing sun's movement, yellow 'Equator' line crosses center, bottom circle labeled 'Tropic of Capricorn'. Small white moon illustration upper right. Bottom text explains: 'The electromagnetic energy from the sun causes the different directions in the currents of Northern Hemi'plane vs Southern Hemi'plane'. Attribution: '©Ashlee Webster'. Website: 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Diagram argues ocean gyres and currents make more sense on flat plane with circling sun than on rotating sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-134","title":"Other 134","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12341245_440357502830656_5309146363670896704_n.png","description":"Historical title page from 1865 flat Earth book. White page with black serif typography. Header reads '[Entered at Stationers' Hall.]' Main title in large capital letters: 'ZETETIC ASTRONOMY. EARTH NOT A GLOBE! AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE TRUE FIGURE OF THE EARTH: PROVING IT A PLANE, WITHOUT AXIAL OR ORBITAL MOTION; AND THE ONLY MATERIAL WORLD IN THE UNIVERSE!' Author listed as 'BY \"PARALLAX.\"' Published in London by 'SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, AND CO., STATIONERS' HALL COURT.' and 'Bath: S. HAYWARD, GREEN STREET.' Date: 1865. Bottom note: '[The Right of Translation is Reserved by the Author.]' with handwritten notation '1746.23'. Zetetic method emphasizes sensory observation over theoretical astronomy. 'Parallax' was pseudonym of Samuel Rowbotham, influential 19th century flat Earth proponent. Book laid foundation for modern flat Earth movement, arguing Earth is stationary plane based on direct observation and experiments rather than heliocentric model"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-133","title":"Other 133","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12339665_442607069272366_5021460751468119153_o.jpg","description":"Water level argument over dramatic ocean/beach sunset scene. Shows dark stormy sky with layers of gray, blue, and purple clouds. Orange-golden sunlight breaks through clouds creating atmospheric lighting. Dark ocean water visible in lower portion with small waves. Horizon line appears flat where ocean meets cloudy sky. White text overlay in elegant font reads: 'Whenever experiments have been tried on the surface of standing water, this surface has always been found to be level. If the Earth were a globe, the surface of all standing water would be convex.' Bottom text in bold white capitals: 'THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROOF THAT EARTH IS NOT A GLOBE.' Argues that still water's observable flatness contradicts spherical Earth, since curved surface would require water to bulge/curve. Presents water's levelness as empirical evidence through direct observation and experimentation. Claims scientific method (experiments on standing water) proves flat Earth rather than theoretical globe model"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-135","title":"Other 135","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12342667_441088416090898_7257479148511891092_n.jpg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
