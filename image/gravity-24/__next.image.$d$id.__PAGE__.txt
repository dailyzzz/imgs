Left side features portrait of Isaac Newton with formula F = Gm₁m₂/r² and text in green 'It's a force. It depends on mass.' Right side shows portrait of Albert Einstein with formula Gμν = 8πGTμν and text in yellow 'It's a distortion of space & time. It depends on energy.' Three red dots connect the competing theories vertically. Bottom text on dark blue background explains: 'As we have seen, matter does not simply pull on other matter across empty space, as Newton had imagined. Rather matter distorts space-time and it is this distorted space-time that in turn affects other matter.' Presents fundamental conceptual difference between Newtonian gravity as force between masses versus Einsteinian gravity as geometric curvature of spacetime caused by energy-mass."},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-25","title":"Gravity 25","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/83732064_619826545258824_3488000077031538688_o.jpeg","description":"Critical analysis of Cavendish experiment from JSTOR webpage showing historical scientific paper 'Experiments to Determine the Density of the Earth.
