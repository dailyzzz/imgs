3:T4c6,Four-panel collage meme titled 'We Live in a Theory Tale' showing major scientific theories presented as unproven narratives. Top left: 'THE BIG BANG THEORY' detailed infographic with orange/space background showing timeline from Big Bang through cosmic evolution, formation of galaxies, stars, planets with technical diagrams and labels. Top right: 'The Theory Of Evolution' showing classic evolution progression illustration - green frog, blue fish, gray ape, purple early human, red modern human walking in sequence. Bottom left: 'Isaac Newton's Theory of Gravity' showing long-haired person (possibly portraying Newton) holding apple against green nature background with moon visible, with 'WHAT' text overlay suggesting incredulity. Bottom right: 'Heliocentric Theory' diagram showing solar system with Sun at center, orbital paths of planets (Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury) in white lines on black space. Bottom text 'We Live in a Theory Tale' implies Big Bang, Evolution, Gravity, and Heliocentric model are all just theoretical stories rather than established science, emphasizing 'theory' to suggest they're unproven beliefs rather than scientific frameworks supported by evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-20","title":"Pseudo Science 20","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/28467661_138866066935182_3163780074870291451_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-19","title":"Pseudo Science 19","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/28056294_10159931981790403_1106138291938487496_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with CGI rendered Earth showing day/night terminator, city lights on dark side, blue oceans, green/brown continents, white clouds, sun rays on left side, black space with stars.

UPSIDE DOWN AND STICKS TO THE SPINNING BALL' Bottom text: 'IM CALLING BULLSHIT!!' Satirical critique listing perceived impossibilities of globe Earth model: people living upside down in Southern Hemisphere, water curving around sphere, rivers flowing uphill (against gravity on curved surface), water adhering to spinning planet. Uses sarcasm to reject globe model physics, questioning how gravity keeps water and people attached to spinning spherical Earth, implying these phenomena are absurd and therefore globe Earth is false."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-21","title":"Pseudo Science 21","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/28783255_847475955454092_6993698239635651174_n.png","description":"Screenshot of Neil deGrasse Tyson verified Twitter post (@neiltyson) from February 24, 2018 at 12:42 PM reading 'A subject is scientifically controversial when actively debated by legions of scientists, not when actively debated by the public, the press, or by politicians.'
