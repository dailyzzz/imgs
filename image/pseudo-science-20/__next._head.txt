5:T4c6,Four-panel collage meme titled 'We Live in a Theory Tale' showing major scientific theories presented as unproven narratives. Top left: 'THE BIG BANG THEORY' detailed infographic with orange/space background showing timeline from Big Bang through cosmic evolution, formation of galaxies, stars, planets with technical diagrams and labels. Top right: 'The Theory Of Evolution' showing classic evolution progression illustration - green frog, blue fish, gray ape, purple early human, red modern human walking in sequence. Bottom left: 'Isaac Newton's Theory of Gravity' showing long-haired person (possibly portraying Newton) holding apple against green nature background with moon visible, with 'WHAT' text overlay suggesting incredulity. Bottom right: 'Heliocentric Theory' diagram showing solar system with Sun at center, orbital paths of planets (Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury) in white lines on black space. Bottom text 'We Live in a Theory Tale' implies Big Bang, Evolution, Gravity, and Heliocentric model are all just theoretical stories rather than established science, emphasizing 'theory' to suggest they're unproven beliefs rather than scientific frameworks supported by evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 20 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Four-panel collage meme titled 'We Live in a Theory Tale' showing major scientific theories presented as unproven narratives.
