Top text reads: 'The error in perspective, which is almost universally committed, consists in causing lines dissimilarly distant from the eye-line to converge to one and the same vanishing point. Whereas it is demonstrable that lines most distant from an eye-line must of necessity converge less rapidly, and must be carried further over the eye-line before they meet it at the angle one minute, which constitutes the vanishing point.' Below shows illustration with figure standing on left observing series of progressively shorter vertical black pillars or rectangles arranged in perspective view, converging toward horizon line (marked with yellow arrow). Yellow arrows label 'EYE LEVEL' at observer's height and 'HORIZON' at ground level where pillars meet vanishing point. Demonstrates technical principle that distant objects converge to vanishing point at different rates depending on distance from eye level."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Perspective 10"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Educational diagram explaining perspective error with black background and white text panel.
