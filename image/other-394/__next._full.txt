13:T1967,Earth from space against starfield with text claiming "It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space." Flat Earth meme demanding continuous full-Earth rotation video as proof of spherical spinning planet, arguing absence of such footage proves Earth doesn't spin or isn't sphere. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Classic "Earth from space" photograph showing full disk of planet against black star-filled background with flat Earth argument text overlay. EARTH IMAGE: Full disk photograph of Earth showing planet as complete sphere. Blue oceans dominate visible hemisphere. White cloud formations swirling across surface - weather patterns visible. Continental landmasses visible - appears to show Western Hemisphere (Americas) or view including North America. Atmospheric haze visible at edges creating soft limb against black space. Terminator line (day/night boundary) may be visible depending on sun angle. Classic "Blue Marble" style photograph. SPACE BACKGROUND: Black space surrounding Earth. Stars visible as white points of light scattered across background. Colorful nebula-like formations visible - purple, blue, green cosmic clouds. This artistic starfield background suggests image may be composite or enhanced for visual appeal. Authentic space photos typically show fewer visible stars due to camera exposure settings optimized for bright Earth. LIGHTING: Earth illuminated by sun from one side. Shadows and highlights show three-dimensional spherical shape. Cloud formations cast shadows on surface below. Consistent lighting across image suggests single light source (sun). TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "IT'S 2016" and "AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY VIDEO FOOTAGE" - Establishes time frame and makes claim about missing evidence. BOTTOM TEXT: "OF THE WHOLE EARTH SPINNING FROM SPACE" - Specifies what evidence flat Earthers claim is lacking. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SPINNING EARTH VIDEO: Flat Earthers claim there's no continuous video showing Earth as complete sphere rotating over 24-hour period. If Earth really spins, why can't we see video of it spinning? NASA should easily be able to provide this "obvious" proof. Absence of such video is presented as evidence that Earth doesn't spin or isn't spherical. 2) ALL IMAGES ARE COMPOSITES/CGI: Flat Earthers argue NASA Earth images are: Computer generated (CGI). Composites stitched from multiple photos. Artistic renderings, not photographs. None show "real" continuous spinning because it doesn't happen. 3) SATELLITE LIMITATIONS: Claim that satellites capable of filming whole Earth don't exist. Geostationary satellites are too close to see whole planet. Deep space probes are conveniently positioned where they can't film Earth spinning. 4) PROOF SHOULD BE EASY: With modern technology, continuous Earth rotation video should be trivial to obtain. The fact that NASA doesn't provide it suggests it's impossible because Earth doesn't actually spin. WHY THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG: 1) SUCH FOOTAGE EXISTS: DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite at L1 Lagrange point provides daily images of full Earth disk. EPIC camera on DSCOVR captures Earth every 1-2 hours showing rotation. Himawari-8 Japanese weather satellite provides full-disk images every 10 minutes. GOES weather satellites provide continuous Western/Eastern hemisphere views. Time-lapse compilations of these images clearly show Earth rotation. 2) PHYSICS OF ORBITAL OBSERVATION: Low Earth orbit satellites (ISS, most imaging satellites) orbit at 250-500 miles altitude - too close to see full disk. They see curved horizon, not complete sphere. Geostationary satellites at 22,236 miles see full disk but of one hemisphere (they're "stationary" relative to Earth's rotation). To see Earth spin, you need camera far from Earth that isn't orbiting (like DSCOVR at L1 point, 1 million miles away). 3) CAMERA EXPOSURE CHALLENGES: Earth is very bright compared to stars. Camera exposure settings that properly expose Earth make stars invisible. Camera settings that show stars overexpose Earth into white blob. This is basic photography - not evidence of fakery. Space photos with visible stars AND properly exposed Earth are composites (honestly labeled as such). 4) DSCOVR/EPIC SPECIFICALLY: DSCOVR satellite launched 2015 specifically provides full-disk Earth images. Located at L1 Lagrange point, 1 million miles from Earth toward Sun. EPIC camera captures full Earth every 1-2 hours. Images clearly show: Earth rotating (continents move across disk). Day/night terminator progressing. Moon passing between satellite and Earth (transit events). Weather systems developing and moving. All publicly available at NASA EPIC website. 5) TIME-LAPSE VIDEOS: Multiple time-lapse videos compiled from satellite imagery show Earth spinning. Japanese Himawari-8 footage particularly impressive - full disk every 10 minutes since 2015. Weather channel and others regularly broadcast this footage. "No video exists" claim is simply false - it's easily findable online. 2016 CONTEXT: Image dated 2016 based on text. DSCOVR launched February 2015, EPIC images available from mid-2015. By 2016, full-disk spinning Earth footage was already publicly available. Claim was already outdated when image was created. Either creator was unaware of DSCOVR/Himawari footage, or deliberately ignored it. MOVING GOALPOSTS: When confronted with DSCOVR/Himawari footage, flat Earthers typically: Claim footage is CGI (unfalsifiable). Claim footage doesn't show "real" spinning (special pleading). Demand different specific footage (moving goalposts). Claim source is untrustworthy (genetic fallacy). No footage would satisfy because conclusion (flat Earth) is predetermined. VISUAL RHETORIC: Beautiful Earth image creates emotional engagement. Starfield background is aesthetically pleasing. Text makes claim seem reasonable without providing evidence it's true. "It's 2016" framing suggests technological capability that should make proof easy. Question format invites viewer to wonder "yeah, why DON'T we have that?" Works if viewer unaware that such footage exists and is publicly available. IRONY: Image literally shows spherical Earth while claiming lack of evidence for spherical Earth. Uses NASA-style Earth imagery to argue NASA doesn't provide real Earth imagery. Makes easily disprovable claim about non-existence of footage that exists. Demonstrates flat Earth community's failure to research before making claims.14:T1bc5,Artistic rendering of Mars landing with astronauts planting American flag, comparing moon landing to Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing as "media hoaxes" and warning future Mars mission will be similar deception. Deeply offensive conspiracy theory image grouping space exploration denial with denial of real tragedies where innocent people died. IMAGE: Artistic/CGI rendering of hypothetical Mars landing scene showing astronauts on Martian surface with American flag. Not actual photograph - appears to be digital art or movie/promotional image depicting future Mars mission concept. MARS SURFACE: Red-orange rocky terrain characteristic of Mars depictions. Dusty, barren landscape with rocky outcrops. Reddish-brown coloring throughout surface. Hazy pinkish-tan sky typical of Mars atmosphere renderings. Surface appears rough and cratered. Equipment and structures visible in background suggesting established base or landing site. ASTRONAUTS: Two astronauts in white spacesuits visible in foreground. Standing together near American flag. Spacesuits appear modern design - more advanced than Apollo-era suits. Helmets and life support systems visible. Posture suggests ceremonial flag-planting moment - recreating iconic Apollo imagery for Mars context. AMERICAN FLAG: Large US flag prominently displayed - stars and stripes clearly visible. Flag mounted on pole, appearing to wave (though Mars has thin atmosphere). Patriotic imagery central to composition. Echoes Apollo 11 moon landing flag photograph. BACKGROUND ELEMENTS: Various equipment and structures visible behind astronauts. Appears to show habitat modules or landing craft. Suggests established presence rather than initial landing. Multiple pieces of equipment scattered across landscape. TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "If you thought the moon landing, Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing were bad media hoaxes" - Groups three completely different events as equivalent "hoaxes." BOTTOM TEXT: "WAIT UNTIL WE 'WALK ON MARS'" - Quotation marks around "walk on Mars" indicate skepticism that future Mars mission would be real. Predicts Mars mission will be faked like moon landing allegedly was. "Nick Havok" attribution visible. "fb.com/fematters" source watermark. DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC CONTENT: This image is particularly harmful because it: 1) EQUATES SPACE EXPLORATION WITH TRAGEDY DENIAL: Groups Apollo moon landing (space achievement) with Sandy Hook (2012 school shooting killing 20 children and 6 adults) and Boston Marathon Bombing (2013 terrorist attack killing 3 and injuring hundreds). Treats denial of real human tragedies as equivalent to space skepticism. 2) SANDY HOOK DENIAL: Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut was real tragedy. 20 first-grade children and 6 staff members were murdered. Conspiracy theories claiming it was "staged" or "hoax" have caused immense additional suffering to grieving families. Families have faced harassment, death threats, and had to move repeatedly due to conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones was sued and found liable for defamation for promoting Sandy Hook denial, resulting in nearly $1.5 billion in damages. 3) BOSTON BOMBING DENIAL: Boston Marathon Bombing on April 15, 2013 killed 3 people and injured over 260. Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified, pursued, and one killed, one captured and later executed. Extensive video evidence, witness testimony, and criminal trial confirmed reality. Denial causes additional pain to victims and survivors. CONSPIRACY THEORY PROGRESSION: Image demonstrates how conspiracy thinking escalates: Starts with relatively "harmless" space skepticism (moon landing denial). Progresses to denial of documented tragedies (mass shootings, terrorist attacks). Creates framework where ANY official narrative can be dismissed as "hoax." Desensitizes believers to dismissing real human suffering. Builds community around shared "forbidden knowledge" regardless of harm caused. FLAT EARTH CONNECTION: While flat Earth and tragedy denial are separate conspiracy theories, they share: Distrust of all official sources. Belief in massive coordinated deception. Community bonding through shared "awakening." Rejection of evidence as fabricated. This image appearing in flat Earth community shows overlap between space denial and broader conspiracy ecosystem. MOON LANDING CLAIMS: Image assumes moon landing was hoax without presenting evidence. Apollo program extensively documented with thousands of photographs, hours of video, hundreds of pounds of moon rocks, scientific experiments still operating today (laser reflectors), independent verification by rival nations (USSR tracked missions), and recent orbital photography of landing sites. MARS MISSION PREDICTION: Image predicts future Mars mission will also be "faked." Implies pattern of space deception will continue. "Wait until" framing suggests upcoming hoax believers should prepare to recognize. Creates unfalsifiable prediction - any future Mars mission will be dismissed as fake regardless of evidence. SCIENTIFIC REALITY: Moon landings: Verified by multiple independent sources including former Soviet Union. Physical evidence (moon rocks) analyzed by scientists worldwide. Retroreflectors placed on Moon still used for laser ranging experiments. Landing sites photographed by multiple nations' lunar orbiters. Sandy Hook: Exhaustively documented tragedy. Death certificates, autopsies, funerals, grieving families, criminal investigation, subsequent legislation. Denying it is not "skepticism" - it's cruelty toward victims' families. Boston Bombing: Captured on multiple surveillance cameras. Perpetrators identified, pursued in televised manhunt, one killed in shootout, one tried and convicted with overwhelming evidence. Survivors with permanent injuries from bombing still alive today. VISUAL RHETORIC: Mars imagery is aspirational/inspirational - appeals to space exploration excitement. Astronauts with flag evokes patriotism and American achievement. Professional-looking rendering suggests legitimacy. Combining appealing visuals with harmful conspiracy text normalizes tragedy denial. Format makes extreme claims seem like reasonable skepticism. HARM CAUSED: Images like this: Spread misinformation about real tragedies. Cause additional trauma to victims' families who encounter denial. Normalize dismissing documented events as "hoaxes." Create pipeline from space skepticism to harmful conspiracy theories. Build communities where any official narrative is suspect. Make it socially acceptable to deny mass casualty events. RESPONSE: This image should be recognized as harmful conspiracy content that: Groups legitimate space skepticism (however misguided) with cruel denial of real tragedies. Causes measurable harm to real people (Sandy Hook families, Boston survivors). Represents escalation of conspiracy thinking into dangerous territory. Should not be normalized or treated as equivalent to other flat Earth content. The families of Sandy Hook victims and Boston bombing survivors deserve better than having their loved ones' deaths dismissed as "media hoaxes."15:T1c37,Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming "Pilots never account for curvature." Flat Earth meme using aviation imagery to argue pilots don't adjust for Earth's curve during flight, presented as evidence that Earth is flat. IMAGE: Professional photograph taken from inside commercial aircraft cockpit during flight, showing both pilots, instrument panels, and view through windscreen. COCKPIT ENVIRONMENT: Modern commercial aircraft flight deck - appears to be Boeing 777 or similar wide-body aircraft based on instrument layout. Glass cockpit with multiple digital displays (Primary Flight Display, Navigation Display, Engine instruments). Overhead panel visible at top of frame showing numerous switches, buttons, and controls - typical of commercial aircraft systems (hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical, lighting). Green backlighting on overhead panel labels - standard for aircraft instrument lighting. Center pedestal between pilots with throttle quadrant, radio panels, and flight management system controls. PILOTS: Two pilots visible from behind - Captain (left seat) and First Officer (right seat). Both wearing white uniform shirts with epaulettes indicating rank. Seated in flight deck seats with headrests visible. Hands on controls - one pilot's hand visible on control yoke. Professional commercial pilots operating aircraft in cruise flight. VIEW THROUGH WINDSCREEN: High-altitude view showing: Horizon line where sky meets earth/clouds below. Beautiful gradient sky - deep blue at top transitioning to lighter blue, then orange/pink near horizon suggesting sunrise or sunset timing. Cloud layer visible below aircraft altitude. Horizon appears straight/flat across windscreen (expected visual appearance at any altitude - curvature is too gradual to perceive from aircraft windows). Earth's surface or lower clouds visible below with various colors and textures. TEXT OVERLAY: Bottom text (white Impact font): "PILOTS NEVER ACCOUNT FOR CURVATURE" - Makes claim about aviation procedures. "fb.com/fematters" attribution at top. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO CURVATURE ADJUSTMENT: Flat Earthers claim pilots don't adjust aircraft pitch/attitude to follow Earth's curve. On spherical Earth, plane would have to constantly nose down to maintain altitude as Earth curves away beneath it. Since pilots don't do this, Earth must be flat. 2) FLAT HORIZON: Horizon visible through cockpit appears flat/straight. If Earth were curved, horizon should appear curved from altitude. Since it looks flat, Earth is flat. 3) PILOT TESTIMONY: Some flat Earthers claim pilots privately admit they don't account for curvature. Training doesn't include curvature corrections. Navigation uses flat maps. If Earth were sphere, aviation would be impossible or radically different. 4) GYROSCOPE ARGUMENT: Aircraft attitude indicators (artificial horizons) are gyroscopic - they maintain orientation in space. If Earth curved, gyroscope would show nose-up attitude change over long flights. Since gyros don't show this, Earth isn't curving. WHY THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG: 1) GRAVITY DOES THE WORK: Aircraft in flight experiences gravity pulling toward Earth's center. "Level flight" means flying perpendicular to gravity - which automatically follows Earth's curve. Pilots don't manually adjust because gravity/physics handle it. It's like asking why you don't "adjust" while walking to keep your feet on the ground - gravity does it automatically. No pilot "accounts for" gravity consciously - they just maintain altitude. 2) WHAT "LEVEL" MEANS: In aviation, "level" means maintaining constant altitude above mean sea level (MSL). Altimeters measure pressure, which changes with altitude. Flying "level" according to altimeter automatically follows Earth's curve. Maintaining 35,000 feet MSL means staying same distance from Earth's surface, which curves. Pilots DO "account for curvature" - it's built into what "level flight" means. 3) ARTIFICIAL HORIZON PHYSICS: Aircraft attitude indicators are gravity-referenced, not space-referenced. They show pitch relative to local gravity vector, not absolute orientation in space. As Earth curves, local "down" direction changes - but this happens to both aircraft AND instrument. Gyros are designed with "erection mechanisms" that align them with local gravity over time. This is deliberate engineering because "level" must mean level relative to Earth, not space. 4) VISIBLE CURVATURE: From commercial aircraft cruise altitude (35,000-45,000 feet), Earth's curvature IS visible but subtle. Field of view through cockpit windows is too narrow to easily perceive curvature. Wide-angle photographs from aircraft DO show slight horizon curve. Curvature becomes obvious at higher altitudes (space, very high altitude aircraft). 5) NAVIGATION PROVES SPHERICAL EARTH: Flight routes calculated using great circle navigation (shortest paths on sphere). Flight times match spherical Earth distances, not flat Earth distances. Transoceanic flights would take dramatically different times on flat vs spherical Earth. GPS navigation works by triangulating from satellites orbiting spherical Earth. All international aviation operates on spherical Earth model because it works. 6) PILOT TRAINING REALITY: Pilots are trained in physics, aerodynamics, navigation - all based on spherical Earth model. Navigation charts use projections that account for Earth's shape. Time zone changes, day/night patterns, seasonal variations all match spherical Earth predictions. No pilot reports surprise at flight times being wrong - they're calculated accurately using spherical geometry. COCKPIT IMAGE ANALYSIS: What image actually shows: Normal commercial flight operations. Horizon appearing straight (expected - too distant to see curvature clearly). Professional pilots using instruments designed for spherical Earth. Level flight maintained by constant altitude, which automatically follows Earth's curve. Nothing in image contradicts spherical Earth - image shows exactly what you'd expect on spherical Earth. APPEAL OF THIS ARGUMENT: Argument is effective because: Aviation seems technical and authoritative. Most people don't understand flight physics. "Pilots don't adjust for curvature" sounds like damning evidence. Creates impression that spherical Earth should require constant obvious adjustment. Misunderstands how gravity and altitude work together. PILOT RESPONSES: Professional pilots regularly debunk this claim: Explain that level flight by definition follows Earth's curve. Note that navigation software assumes spherical Earth and works perfectly. Point out that flight routes match great circle paths on sphere. Describe how international flights would be impossible if Earth were flat. Flat Earth flight route predictions don't match actual flight times. VISUAL RHETORIC: Cockpit imagery is impressive and technical. Suggests insider/expert knowledge about aviation. Sunset lighting creates beautiful, engaging photograph. Professional pilots visible suggests credibility. Simple text claim allows viewers to accept without questioning. Works if viewer doesn't understand that "maintaining altitude" automatically accounts for curvature.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-394","title":"Other 394","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12983414_487024348163971_3915253100816557183_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-393","title":"Other 393","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12974322_490502564482816_557130847834532251_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-395","title":"Other 395","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12983872_489419371257802_7738578639032275865_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

Either creator was unaware of DSCOVR/Himawari footage, or deliberately ignored it. MOVING GOALPOSTS: When confronted with DSCOVR/Himawari footage, flat Earthers typically: Claim footage is CGI (unfalsifiable). Claim footage doesn't show "real" spinning (special pleading). Demand different specific footage (moving goalposts). Claim source is untrustworthy (genetic fallacy). No footage would satisfy because conclusion (flat Earth) is predetermined. VISUAL RHETORIC: Beautiful Earth image creates emotional engagement. Starfield background is aesthetically pleasing. Text makes claim seem reasonable without providing evidence it's true. "It's 2016" framing suggests technological capability that should make proof easy. Question format invites viewer to wonder "yeah, why DON'T we have that?" Works if viewer unaware that such footage exists and is publicly available. IRONY: Image literally shows spherical Earth while claiming lack of evidence for spherical Earth. Uses NASA-style Earth imagery to argue NASA doesn't provide real Earth imagery. Makes easily disprovable claim about non-existence of footage that exists. Demonstrates flat Earth community's failure to research before making claims.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 394 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Earth from space against starfield with text claiming \"It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space.\" Flat Eart..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 394"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Earth from space against starfield with text claiming \"It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space.\" Flat Eart..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12983414_487024348163971_3915253100816557183_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$16"}],"$L17","$L18","$L19","$L1a","$L1b"]
