5:T1967,Earth from space against starfield with text claiming "It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space." Flat Earth meme demanding continuous full-Earth rotation video as proof of spherical spinning planet, arguing absence of such footage proves Earth doesn't spin or isn't sphere. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Classic "Earth from space" photograph showing full disk of planet against black star-filled background with flat Earth argument text overlay. EARTH IMAGE: Full disk photograph of Earth showing planet as complete sphere. Blue oceans dominate visible hemisphere. White cloud formations swirling across surface - weather patterns visible. Continental landmasses visible - appears to show Western Hemisphere (Americas) or view including North America. Atmospheric haze visible at edges creating soft limb against black space. Terminator line (day/night boundary) may be visible depending on sun angle. Classic "Blue Marble" style photograph. SPACE BACKGROUND: Black space surrounding Earth. Stars visible as white points of light scattered across background. Colorful nebula-like formations visible - purple, blue, green cosmic clouds. This artistic starfield background suggests image may be composite or enhanced for visual appeal. Authentic space photos typically show fewer visible stars due to camera exposure settings optimized for bright Earth. LIGHTING: Earth illuminated by sun from one side. Shadows and highlights show three-dimensional spherical shape. Cloud formations cast shadows on surface below. Consistent lighting across image suggests single light source (sun). TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "IT'S 2016" and "AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY VIDEO FOOTAGE" - Establishes time frame and makes claim about missing evidence. BOTTOM TEXT: "OF THE WHOLE EARTH SPINNING FROM SPACE" - Specifies what evidence flat Earthers claim is lacking. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SPINNING EARTH VIDEO: Flat Earthers claim there's no continuous video showing Earth as complete sphere rotating over 24-hour period. If Earth really spins, why can't we see video of it spinning? NASA should easily be able to provide this "obvious" proof. Absence of such video is presented as evidence that Earth doesn't spin or isn't spherical. 2) ALL IMAGES ARE COMPOSITES/CGI: Flat Earthers argue NASA Earth images are: Computer generated (CGI). Composites stitched from multiple photos. Artistic renderings, not photographs. None show "real" continuous spinning because it doesn't happen. 3) SATELLITE LIMITATIONS: Claim that satellites capable of filming whole Earth don't exist. Geostationary satellites are too close to see whole planet. Deep space probes are conveniently positioned where they can't film Earth spinning. 4) PROOF SHOULD BE EASY: With modern technology, continuous Earth rotation video should be trivial to obtain. The fact that NASA doesn't provide it suggests it's impossible because Earth doesn't actually spin. WHY THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG: 1) SUCH FOOTAGE EXISTS: DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite at L1 Lagrange point provides daily images of full Earth disk. EPIC camera on DSCOVR captures Earth every 1-2 hours showing rotation. Himawari-8 Japanese weather satellite provides full-disk images every 10 minutes. GOES weather satellites provide continuous Western/Eastern hemisphere views. Time-lapse compilations of these images clearly show Earth rotation. 2) PHYSICS OF ORBITAL OBSERVATION: Low Earth orbit satellites (ISS, most imaging satellites) orbit at 250-500 miles altitude - too close to see full disk. They see curved horizon, not complete sphere. Geostationary satellites at 22,236 miles see full disk but of one hemisphere (they're "stationary" relative to Earth's rotation). To see Earth spin, you need camera far from Earth that isn't orbiting (like DSCOVR at L1 point, 1 million miles away). 3) CAMERA EXPOSURE CHALLENGES: Earth is very bright compared to stars. Camera exposure settings that properly expose Earth make stars invisible. Camera settings that show stars overexpose Earth into white blob. This is basic photography - not evidence of fakery. Space photos with visible stars AND properly exposed Earth are composites (honestly labeled as such). 4) DSCOVR/EPIC SPECIFICALLY: DSCOVR satellite launched 2015 specifically provides full-disk Earth images. Located at L1 Lagrange point, 1 million miles from Earth toward Sun. EPIC camera captures full Earth every 1-2 hours. Images clearly show: Earth rotating (continents move across disk). Day/night terminator progressing. Moon passing between satellite and Earth (transit events). Weather systems developing and moving. All publicly available at NASA EPIC website. 5) TIME-LAPSE VIDEOS: Multiple time-lapse videos compiled from satellite imagery show Earth spinning. Japanese Himawari-8 footage particularly impressive - full disk every 10 minutes since 2015. Weather channel and others regularly broadcast this footage. "No video exists" claim is simply false - it's easily findable online. 2016 CONTEXT: Image dated 2016 based on text. DSCOVR launched February 2015, EPIC images available from mid-2015. By 2016, full-disk spinning Earth footage was already publicly available. Claim was already outdated when image was created. Either creator was unaware of DSCOVR/Himawari footage, or deliberately ignored it. MOVING GOALPOSTS: When confronted with DSCOVR/Himawari footage, flat Earthers typically: Claim footage is CGI (unfalsifiable). Claim footage doesn't show "real" spinning (special pleading). Demand different specific footage (moving goalposts). Claim source is untrustworthy (genetic fallacy). No footage would satisfy because conclusion (flat Earth) is predetermined. VISUAL RHETORIC: Beautiful Earth image creates emotional engagement. Starfield background is aesthetically pleasing. Text makes claim seem reasonable without providing evidence it's true. "It's 2016" framing suggests technological capability that should make proof easy. Question format invites viewer to wonder "yeah, why DON'T we have that?" Works if viewer unaware that such footage exists and is publicly available. IRONY: Image literally shows spherical Earth while claiming lack of evidence for spherical Earth. Uses NASA-style Earth imagery to argue NASA doesn't provide real Earth imagery. Makes easily disprovable claim about non-existence of footage that exists. Demonstrates flat Earth community's failure to research before making claims.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 394 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Earth from space against starfield with text claiming \"It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space.\" Flat Eart..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 394"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Earth from space against starfield with text claiming \"It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space.\" Flat Eart..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12983414_487024348163971_3915253100816557183_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
