3:T5f7,Lake Pontchartrain Causeway aerial view claiming missing curvature over 23.87 miles. Shows aerial photograph of Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana from high altitude. Image captured from aircraft looking down at bridge stretching diagonally across frame from upper left to lower right. Bridge appears as two parallel white-gray concrete roadways with yellow center line markings running perfectly straight across water. Structure extends to horizon creating geometric line bisecting image. Left side and upper portion shows land or developed shoreline area - tan-brown urban/suburban development visible with roads, buildings, structures creating textured landscape meeting water's edge. Right side and lower portion shows Lake Pontchartrain water in light turquoise-blue color extending to horizon. Water surface appears smooth with slight texture. Sky shows light blue gradient with white clouds. Bridge appears absolutely straight with no visible curve despite 23+ mile length. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN CAUSEWAY METAIRIE, LA'. Center displays translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in white bold letters: '23.87 MILES LONG 380 FEET OF MISSING CURVATURE'. Flat Earth argument calculates using 8 inches per mile squared formula: at 23.87 miles, Earth's curvature should create 380 foot drop requiring bridge to arc upward to compensate, but bridge appears straight. Mainstream explanation: camera angle and atmospheric refraction affect perception4:T604,Apollo command module water training mockingly labeled as gravitational waves. Shows vintage NASA training photograph at outdoor facility. Large white Apollo command module mockup floating in bright turquoise-blue swimming pool. Module displays conical shape with gray heat shield base, white upper section, small windows visible, yellow equipment or framework attached to top. Pool appears to be large rectangular training tank with concrete edges. Multiple people in water - several wearing light-colored flight suits or training gear floating on yellow inflatable rafts positioned around module. One person appears to be practicing water egress procedures. Another person swimming in water. Personnel on pool deck visible in background wearing white shirts. Background shows brown fence, utility poles, power lines, open flat landscape suggesting desert or coastal training facility (likely Ellington Field or similar NASA site). Sky shows overcast gray-blue conditions. Lower left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom center shows large white text with black outline: 'GRAVITY WAVES'. Image satirizes 2016 LIGO gravitational wave detection announcement by showing literal water waves in NASA training pool. Moon landing skeptics point to Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory underwater training as evidence spacewalk footage was filmed in pools rather than space. Suggests 'gravity waves' are just water ripples from astronaut pool training rather than cosmic phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general relativity5:T5d2,Airplane window view of snowy landscape with flat horizon questioning denial of senses. Shows photograph taken from commercial aircraft window seat at cruising altitude (approximately 30,000-40,000 feet). View looks down and outward at winter landscape below. Lower half displays terrain with snow-covered ground creating white patches interspersed with darker forested or bare ground areas creating mottled brown-gray-white pattern. Shows valleys, hills, possible river systems creating meandering patterns through landscape. Geographic features suggest mountainous or hilly region with snow accumulation in valleys and on peaks. Upper half shows sky - gradient from darker blue at top transitioning to lighter blue-gray near horizon. Thin white cloud layer visible at middle distance. Most significant feature: horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight where land meets sky, extending across entire width of image at approximately eye level. No visible curvature despite high altitude vantage point. Lower left shows 'flat earth matters' watermark in light blue translucent text. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'HOW LONG WILL YOU CONTINUE'. Bottom text: 'TO DENY YOUR OWN SENSES?' Flat Earth argument emphasizes trusting direct sensory observation over scientific authority. Claims if Earth were truly spherical, curvature should be observable from airplane altitude, but horizon appears flat validating personal empirical evidence over theoretical models0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-250","title":"Other 250","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698459_462795033920236_8668119608642346417_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-249","title":"Other 249","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698457_465227530343653_6140738402944405606_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-251","title":"Other 251","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12698463_461734087359664_377936747346123944_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
