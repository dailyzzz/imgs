3:T50a,Text-based gravity debunking argument over winter landscape. Background shows gray monochrome photograph of bare deciduous trees in winter with branches creating intricate patterns against overcast sky. Ground appears to show grass or field in gray tones. White text overlay reads: 'Ball-believers often claim "gravity" magically and inexplicably drags the entire lower-atmosphere of the Earth in perfect synchronization up to some undetermined height where this progressively faster spinning atmosphere gives way to the non-spinning, non-gravitized, non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space. Such non-sensical theories are debunked, however, by rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, clouds, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if both the ball-Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards at 1000mph.' Flat Earth argument questioning atmospheric physics on spinning globe. Points out objects in atmosphere (rain drops, smoke, birds) should be affected by 1000mph eastward rotation if Earth truly spins. Argues stationary atmospheric observations contradict spinning globe model. Questions how atmosphere can simultaneously rotate with Earth yet allow objects to move freely in all directions. Lists everyday phenomena as evidence against rotation4:T4ec,Sunset cliff edge photograph with empirical observation message. Shows dramatic sunset scene from elevated cliff or mountain viewpoint. Sky displays beautiful gradient from light blue-gray at top transitioning through pink-orange-peach tones to bright yellow-orange near horizon where sun sets. Brilliant white-yellow sun partially visible at horizon line. Ocean or large body of water extends to horizon showing subtle wave patterns in orange-pink reflection. Right side shows dark silhouetted rocky cliff edge with group of approximately 8-10 people standing at precipice watching sunset. Figures appear as black silhouettes against illuminated sky. Horizon appears perfectly flat and level where water meets sky. Top text in white handwritten-style font: 'The flat earth reality'. Bottom text: 'is what your eyes actually see!' Bottom left shows circular flat Earth map logo (azimuthal equidistant projection) with text 'EARTH IS FLAT RESEARCH IT!' in white. Bottom right shows 'PICCOLLAGE' credit. Argues direct sensory experience (seeing flat horizon) should be trusted over abstract scientific models. Encourages empiricism and personal observation rather than accepting authority. Uses beautiful natural vista to create emotional connection with message5:T4bd,Leonardo DiCaprio laughing meme mocking Eratosthenes experiment. Shows scene from Django Unchained (2012) with Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie character in period costume. DiCaprio wears cream/beige suit jacket, white dress shirt, dark bow tie or cravat. Sits at table with wine glass visible. Background shows blurred figure (Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen) in dark suit. DiCaprio's face shows intense laughter - mouth wide open showing teeth, eyes squinting, leaning back in chair. Warm amber lighting suggests candlelit interior. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN SOMEONE SAYS'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center-bottom shows 'JM' logo. Bottom text: 'WE HAVE BEEN PROVING THE EARTH IS ROUND WITH STICKS IN THE SAND SINCE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.' Mocks Eratosthenes' famous experiment (circa 240 BCE) measuring Earth's circumference using shadows cast by sticks in different cities. Flat Earth proponents argue this experiment only proves sun is close and local, not that Earth is sphere. Points out same shadow length differences occur with nearby light source over flat plane. Uses DiCaprio's condescending laughter to suggest belief in ancient stick experiment is naive0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-190","title":"Other 190","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540838_455168971349509_3096914604043279051_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-189","title":"Other 189","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540555_455168924682847_336821664760809593_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-191","title":"Other 191","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540859_457952671071139_8379451833016280622_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
