5:T50a,Text-based gravity debunking argument over winter landscape. Background shows gray monochrome photograph of bare deciduous trees in winter with branches creating intricate patterns against overcast sky. Ground appears to show grass or field in gray tones. White text overlay reads: 'Ball-believers often claim "gravity" magically and inexplicably drags the entire lower-atmosphere of the Earth in perfect synchronization up to some undetermined height where this progressively faster spinning atmosphere gives way to the non-spinning, non-gravitized, non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space. Such non-sensical theories are debunked, however, by rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, clouds, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if both the ball-Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards at 1000mph.' Flat Earth argument questioning atmospheric physics on spinning globe. Points out objects in atmosphere (rain drops, smoke, birds) should be affected by 1000mph eastward rotation if Earth truly spins. Argues stationary atmospheric observations contradict spinning globe model. Questions how atmosphere can simultaneously rotate with Earth yet allow objects to move freely in all directions. Lists everyday phenomena as evidence against rotation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 190 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Text-based gravity debunking argument over winter landscape.
