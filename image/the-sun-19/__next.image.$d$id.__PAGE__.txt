3:T40c,Two-panel comparison meme demonstrating simultaneous sunset and sunrise. Top panel shows dusky sunset scene over water in Japan with pinkish-orange sky, dark silhouette of vehicle and landscape, reflection on water surface. Caption reads 'I sent my parents a picture of the sunset in Japan.' Bottom panel shows golden sunrise over ocean in Florida with bright yellow sun partially above horizon, layered clouds, blue water reflecting sunlight. Caption reads 'They sent me a picture 20 minutes later of the sunrise from Florida.' Below panels shows Tumblr/social media conversation: 'unwinona:', 'tattoos-n-tokes Deactivated.', 'this is why the world is beautiful. maybe its just me but i find this cool as fuck', and '*Your kid says hi.' -The sun'. Watermark 'Poxlize' at bottom. Demonstrates Earth's rotation causing simultaneous day/night in different locations, though sometimes used in flat Earth discussions to question how sun can set and rise simultaneously on spherical Earth (actually expected due to Earth's rotation and size)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-19","title":"The Sun 19","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/286406803_1675006936213298_5147074918678646580_n.jpeg","description":"Educational diagram about Earth-Sun distance and seasons with white background. Header text reads 'According to NASA, the amount of distance between the earth and the sun has no impact on our climate or seasons.' Shows elliptical orbit (blue oval) with large yellow sun at center and two small Earth globes at opposite sides. Left Earth labeled 'Summer' at distance '94.44 Million miles' and right Earth labeled 'Winter' at distance '91.33 Million miles'. Center text asks 'In fact we're closer to the sun when it's colder...?' Questions common misconception that seasons are caused by varying Earth-Sun distance. Actually demonstrates correct astronomical fact: Earth is closer to sun during Northern Hemisphere winter (perihelion) and farther during summer (aphelion), proving seasons result from axial tilt (23.5°) rather than distance variation. However, presentation implies this is contradictory or suspicious rather than expected consequence of axial tilt model"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-18","title":"The Sun 18","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/270161749_10158538306972913_2305255635233498021_n.jpeg","description":"Dramatic sunset photograph over ocean showing sun partially obscured by layered dark storm clouds, creating striking silhouette effect. Large cloud bank sits at horizon with sun visible as bright white semicircle being cut by cloud layers, displaying unusual cup or bowl shape due to atmospheric refraction and cloud obstruction. Sky shows warm orange and coral gradient near horizon transitioning to darker golden-brown and gray tones above. Cloud edges illuminated with brilliant golden-orange backlighting creating glowing outline effect. Calm blue ocean water fills lower portion of frame. Single contrail or cloud streak visible in upper left corner. Demonstrates complex atmospheric optics where refraction, cloud layers, and perspective create unusual sun shapes during sunset, phenomena sometimes interpreted as evidence for alternative cosmological models when effects of atmospheric refraction and cloud cover are not considered"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-20","title":"The Sun 20","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/290c4ac2d79e471b3f6f0d26be2c21a6.jpeg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
