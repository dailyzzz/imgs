3:T4a3,Falling Down movie meme featuring Michael Douglas as character D-FENS/William Foster. Shows Douglas in iconic scene standing on grassy hill with urban skyline visible in hazy purple-blue background. Character wears white short-sleeve dress shirt, dark striped tie, black pants, thick-framed glasses. Hair slicked back, stern expression on face. Holds black briefcase in right hand, rifle/weapon in left hand. Green grass and small tree visible in foreground. Cityscape buildings create misty backdrop. Image captures moment of character's breakdown and rejection of society. Top text in large outlined white letters: 'WHEN YOU REALIZE'. Top right shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark. Bottom text: 'THEY LIED ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH'. References Falling Down's themes of discovering uncomfortable truths about society and rejecting mainstream narratives. Character's armed rebellion against societal norms parallels flat Earth awakening narrative of discovering deception. Uses Michael Douglas' intense expression and armed stance to convey anger at perceived lies about Earth's shape. Suggests flat Earth realization leads to fundamental questioning of all authority and institutions4:T488,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to look downwards at the horizon'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe5:T527,Artistic cross-section sculpture demonstrating water's properties with text overlay. Shows gray neutral background. Sculpture appears to be concrete or stone cut away to reveal transparent turquoise/teal resin or glass representing water inside. Gray concrete/stone forms irregular container with curved bottom surface and architectural features like arched opening/window. Transparent blue-green material fills container showing water conforming to shape with realistic surface tension - small ripples and waves visible at top surface suggesting movement. Vertical striations in transparent material create realistic water texture. Small cylindrical brown object (possibly lighthouse or post) protrudes from top of structure. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER TAKES THE SHAPE OF ITS RECEPTACLE AND FINDS ITS LEVEL'. Bottom text: 'AND IT FLOWS OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES KEEPING IT IN'. Right side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Demonstrates fundamental properties of water - conforming to container shape and seeking level surface. Argues if Earth were spinning sphere, water would need container/force to hold it on curved surface. Suggests oceans remaining on Earth without flowing off edges implies Earth is flat plane with boundaries (ice wall/Antarctica) rather than borderless sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-149","title":"Other 149","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440586_477157479150658_7825537357449352860_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-148","title":"Other 148","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440454_455797657953307_2589827333278940772_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-150","title":"Other 150","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440597_481006972099042_1879922258013738237_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
