5:T8b6,NASA budget versus Earth images meme claiming photography fraud. Image macro questioning NASA's use of taxpayer funding featuring space photograph. Top text in large bold white letters on black background: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016, $19.3 BILLION'. Center displays dramatic nighttime Earth photograph from space showing planet from orbital perspective. Image shows curved edge of Earth with distinctive thin blue-green line of atmosphere/aurora creating glowing arc along horizon. Below atmospheric layer visible extensive city lights across landmass appearing as golden-orange scattered points and clusters illuminating populated regions - likely showing North America or Europe based on light patterns. Darker areas represent oceans or unpopulated regions. Dense concentrations of lights indicate major metropolitan areas with connecting illuminated highways visible as glowing lines between cities. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Lower atmosphere shows subtle green auroral glow. Earth's curvature clearly visible. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'WHAT DO WE GET FOR THAT ?? FAKE PICTURES OF THE EARTH!!'. Lower left corner shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Flat Earth argument claims NASA's large budget produces only fake CGI images rather than authentic space photography. However, NASA's $19.3B budget (2016) funded far more than Earth photography: planetary missions (Mars rovers, Juno at Jupiter), space telescopes (Hubble, Kepler), ISS operations, aeronautics research, climate monitoring satellites, technology development, hundreds of ongoing missions. Earth photography is tiny fraction of activities. This particular image appears genuine - shows realistic atmospheric layers, light pollution patterns matching population density, proper orbital perspective, accurate aurora, consistent lighting. Multiple independent space agencies (ESA, ROSCOSMOS, JAXA, CNSA, ISRO) plus commercial entities (SpaceX, Blue Origin) all produce similar Earth photographs. Thousands of astronauts from dozens of countries have photographed Earth. All show spherical planet. Calling images 'fake' dismisses overwhelming photographic evidence from countless independent sources over 60+ years of spaceflight0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 270 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"NASA budget versus Earth images meme claiming photography fraud.
