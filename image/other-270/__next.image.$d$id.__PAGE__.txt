3:T8b6,NASA budget versus Earth images meme claiming photography fraud. Image macro questioning NASA's use of taxpayer funding featuring space photograph. Top text in large bold white letters on black background: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016, $19.3 BILLION'. Center displays dramatic nighttime Earth photograph from space showing planet from orbital perspective. Image shows curved edge of Earth with distinctive thin blue-green line of atmosphere/aurora creating glowing arc along horizon. Below atmospheric layer visible extensive city lights across landmass appearing as golden-orange scattered points and clusters illuminating populated regions - likely showing North America or Europe based on light patterns. Darker areas represent oceans or unpopulated regions. Dense concentrations of lights indicate major metropolitan areas with connecting illuminated highways visible as glowing lines between cities. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Lower atmosphere shows subtle green auroral glow. Earth's curvature clearly visible. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'WHAT DO WE GET FOR THAT ?? FAKE PICTURES OF THE EARTH!!'. Lower left corner shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Flat Earth argument claims NASA's large budget produces only fake CGI images rather than authentic space photography. However, NASA's $19.3B budget (2016) funded far more than Earth photography: planetary missions (Mars rovers, Juno at Jupiter), space telescopes (Hubble, Kepler), ISS operations, aeronautics research, climate monitoring satellites, technology development, hundreds of ongoing missions. Earth photography is tiny fraction of activities. This particular image appears genuine - shows realistic atmospheric layers, light pollution patterns matching population density, proper orbital perspective, accurate aurora, consistent lighting. Multiple independent space agencies (ESA, ROSCOSMOS, JAXA, CNSA, ISRO) plus commercial entities (SpaceX, Blue Origin) all produce similar Earth photographs. Thousands of astronauts from dozens of countries have photographed Earth. All show spherical planet. Calling images 'fake' dismisses overwhelming photographic evidence from countless independent sources over 60+ years of spaceflight4:T7d2,High altitude curved horizon photograph conversion story meme. Two-panel meme describing flat Earth conversion moment. Top text in large bold white letters: 'HOW DID I BECOME A FLAT EARTHER?'. Main image shows spectacular high-altitude photograph taken from aircraft or weather balloon. View looks across curved horizon showing Earth's curvature. Upper portion displays dark gradient sky transitioning from nearly black space at top through deep blue, then lighter blue closer to horizon. Stars visible as white specks in darkest regions suggesting very high altitude (possibly 60,000+ feet or lower stratosphere). Horizon shows subtle but definite curve spanning width of image. Below horizon line visible cloud formations or terrain features - lighter tan/beige coloring with blue-gray atmospheric layers. Reflection or bright area visible on surface possibly from sun glare on water or clouds. Right side shows slight pinkish-purple atmospheric glow. Lower portion shows more cloud coverage in lighter tones. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'I TRIED DEBUNKING THE FLAT EARTH'. Lower right corner shows 'Nick Havok' signature/watermark. Meme describes common flat Earth conversion narrative where skeptics claim they initially set out to disprove flat Earth theory but became convinced by their research. Ironically, image actually shows Earth's curvature - gentle arc of horizon visible across frame. However, some flat Earthers claim this curvature is fisheye lens distortion from camera. At very high altitudes (above 50,000 feet), Earth's curvature becomes clearly visible to human eye and cameras with wide-angle lenses. Standard windows and cameras can show curvature from commercial flight altitudes (~35,000 feet) though more subtle. Image demonstrates exactly what debunking flat Earth would show - observable curvature. Common psychological phenomenon where confirmation bias leads people to interpret evidence supporting preexisting beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence5:T855,Kyle meme collage about Earth shape apathy versus passionate truth-seekers. Complex multi-panel meme using 'Disappointed/Disgusted Kyle' template featuring numerous repeated images of same bald character. Background collage contains approximately 40+ instances of similar-looking bald male face in various situations - eating burgers, holding drinks (Starbucks cups visible), ice cream cones, phones, looking disgusted or disappointed. Some panels show magazine covers or advertisements. Character appears to be stock photo model used repeatedly across different scenarios. Images arranged in chaotic overlapping grid pattern filling entire frame. Top text in white with black outline: 'WHO CARES IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT COLD, HARD HOLLOW STARE OF THOSE THAT SIMPLY DON'T CARE'. Lower right corner shows red 'DOUBLE GLP' text and 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme contrasts two mindsets: apathetic mainstream person who doesn't question Earth's shape versus passionate truth-seeker who cares deeply about cosmological reality. 'Kyle' character represents stereotypical millennial consumer - bald, somewhat bland expression, frequently shown with consumer products (fast food, coffee, snacks). Repeated imagery creates unsettling effect suggesting mindless conformity and vacant disinterest. Flat Earth community uses this format to criticize what they perceive as intellectual laziness - people who accept conventional wisdom without investigation. Implies those who don't care about Earth's shape are empty, shallow, distracted by consumerism and trivial concerns. By contrast, flat Earthers position themselves as engaged critical thinkers pursuing truth regardless of social consequences. 'Cold, hard hollow stare' describes perceived vacancy in eyes of those who never questioned globe Earth model. However, most people accept spherical Earth based on abundant evidence rather than apathy - curvature visible from altitude, ships disappearing over horizon, circumnavigation, satellite communications, seasons, time zones, Foucault pendulum, stellar parallax, etc.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-270","title":"Other 270","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717576_462951923904547_468875960546489441_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-269","title":"Other 269","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717444_466164306916642_6606864137146950786_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-271","title":"Other 271","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717576_463022067230866_8640594122558677966_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
