3:T429,Educational poster with blue header text: 'No matter where you view the earth from above, the curvature of the earth proves it's round. After thousands of years, the idea of a flat earth is still wrong.' Shows 3x3 grid of nine ISS (International Space Station) photographs of Earth from orbit, each labeled: 'ISS over Australia' (showing glowing blue landmass at night), 'Pacific Ocean' (showing sun reflection on water), 'ISS over North America' (showing continent with city lights), 'ISS over the Nile and Red Sea' (showing river and lights), 'ISS over Moscow, Russia' (showing nighttime city lights), 'Europe to East Asia' (showing extensive golden city lights), 'ISS over the Arctic Ocean' (showing aurora/northern lights in green), 'ISS over Southern Africa' (showing cloud formations), 'ISS over the Antarctic' (showing ice shelf/polar region from above). All images show curved Earth horizon with black space above, demonstrating visible curvature from orbital altitude. Presents photographic evidence of Earth's spherical shape from multiple viewing angles.4:T4bc,Complex conspiracy theory infographic analyzing Apollo 17 Blue Marble photograph. Top banner: 'THE CONDITIONING AND PROGRAMMING IS OUTRAGOUS'. Upper section shows sepia world map with labeled cities (Helsinki, Moscow, Lima, Santiago, etc.) demonstrating sunlight coverage at 10:38 AM UTC/GMT on December 7, 1972, with yellow dashed line marking equator position. Text explains Apollo 17 photograph timing. Middle caption on cartoon composite image: 'ON THIS CARTOON COMPOSITE INADMISSIBLE HOAXED FIRST PHOTO OF EARTH TAKEN IN 1972 APOLLO 17 FROM 18,000 MILES AWAY' lists cities in daylight simultaneously. Lower section shows Blue Marble image with annotations: 'AFRICA 4600miles WIDE?' with red arrow, 'SUN' with yellow circle, moon position, '25,000mile CIRCUMFERENCE' measurement, 'SAME DISTANCE?' comparison arrows, various critiques including 'NO STARS', 'LAND MASS IS MISSING', '90% OF THE WORLD IS IN COMPLETE DARKNESS'. Left sidebar: 'Your INABILITY to GRASP SCIENCE is not a VALID ARGUMENT against it!' with 'A TRUTH TROOPER' logo. Bottom: 'THE FACT YOU DON'T SEE IT IS BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE NOT TO!'
