5:T57d,Aerial cloudscape photograph with flat Earth mission statement overlay. Shows breathtaking high-altitude view above cloud layer. Dark blue gradient sky at top transitioning to lighter blue at horizon. Bright white sun visible in upper right with dramatic lens flare and radiating light beams. Thick layer of white-gray puffy cumulus clouds fills middle and lower portion creating soft cotton-like texture. Clouds show depth and dimension with shadows and highlights. Snow-covered mountain peaks barely visible poking through clouds in center-left area showing tan-brown rocky surfaces. Atmospheric haze creates layers of depth. Top left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Large white text spans top: 'We Are Not Here to Convert,' Bold white text with black outline at bottom: 'WE ARE HERE TO OPEN MINDS'. Bottom right corner shows 'JM' signature watermark.
