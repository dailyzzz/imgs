Featured article titled 'Was This World Map Made Ten Centuries Ago?' with subtitle 'A Cow Named Brunette' discusses ancient cartography. Center shows two images: top displays circular azimuthal equidistant projection map (flat Earth model) with concentric circles radiating from North Pole center, continents arranged around perimeter, labeled landmasses visible. Bottom image shows sepia-toned photograph of person standing near trees in outdoor setting. Article text discusses historical map discovery and authenticity questions.
