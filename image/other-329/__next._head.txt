5:T927,Motivational meme showing mountain climber silhouette standing atop rocky mountain peak with dramatic cloud layer below and blue sky above. Text at top reads "THOSE WHO HAVE EYES DO NOT BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT" and bottom text states "THEY SEE IT". Image presents classic flat Earth argument that from high altitudes (mountains, airplanes), observers can see horizon appears flat rather than curved, suggesting this visual evidence contradicts spherical Earth model. Stunning landscape photograph features lone hiker positioned on snowy/rocky summit with sea of white clouds stretching to horizon below, bright sun creating lens flare in upper portion of frame, creating dramatic perspective that emphasizes vast horizontal plane of cloud layer. Argument relies on limited human perspective and scale - Earth's curvature becomes visible only at much higher altitudes (typically above 35,000 feet or from spacecraft), and from mountaintop elevations (even 20,000+ feet), curvature is extremely subtle due to Earth's large size (7,917 mile diameter means curvature drops only about 8 inches per mile squared). What observers interpret as "flat" horizon is actually limitation of human visual system combined with atmospheric effects and fact that from any ground-based vantage point, observer is viewing tiny fraction of Earth's total surface. Commercial airline passengers at cruising altitude (35,000-40,000 feet) can observe slight curvature when looking at horizon, though effect is subtle. High-altitude balloon footage and images from International Space Station clearly show Earth's curvature. Meme employs "seeing is believing" rhetoric to suggest direct observation trumps scientific measurements and calculations, but fails to account for limitations of human perception at planetary scales. Cloud layer in image creates particularly deceptive effect, as uniform horizontal plane of clouds reinforces impression of flatness, even though clouds themselves follow Earth's curvature. Scientific rebuttal: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles; from typical mountain summit (10,000-15,000 feet altitude), horizon distance extends only 120-150 miles, representing less than 0.5% of Earth's circumference - far too small a sample to visually detect overall curvature.
