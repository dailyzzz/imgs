3:T927,Motivational meme showing mountain climber silhouette standing atop rocky mountain peak with dramatic cloud layer below and blue sky above. Text at top reads "THOSE WHO HAVE EYES DO NOT BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT" and bottom text states "THEY SEE IT". Image presents classic flat Earth argument that from high altitudes (mountains, airplanes), observers can see horizon appears flat rather than curved, suggesting this visual evidence contradicts spherical Earth model. Stunning landscape photograph features lone hiker positioned on snowy/rocky summit with sea of white clouds stretching to horizon below, bright sun creating lens flare in upper portion of frame, creating dramatic perspective that emphasizes vast horizontal plane of cloud layer. Argument relies on limited human perspective and scale - Earth's curvature becomes visible only at much higher altitudes (typically above 35,000 feet or from spacecraft), and from mountaintop elevations (even 20,000+ feet), curvature is extremely subtle due to Earth's large size (7,917 mile diameter means curvature drops only about 8 inches per mile squared). What observers interpret as "flat" horizon is actually limitation of human visual system combined with atmospheric effects and fact that from any ground-based vantage point, observer is viewing tiny fraction of Earth's total surface. Commercial airline passengers at cruising altitude (35,000-40,000 feet) can observe slight curvature when looking at horizon, though effect is subtle. High-altitude balloon footage and images from International Space Station clearly show Earth's curvature. Meme employs "seeing is believing" rhetoric to suggest direct observation trumps scientific measurements and calculations, but fails to account for limitations of human perception at planetary scales. Cloud layer in image creates particularly deceptive effect, as uniform horizontal plane of clouds reinforces impression of flatness, even though clouds themselves follow Earth's curvature. Scientific rebuttal: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles; from typical mountain summit (10,000-15,000 feet altitude), horizon distance extends only 120-150 miles, representing less than 0.5% of Earth's circumference - far too small a sample to visually detect overall curvature.

Photograph showing person's leg with permanent NASA tattoo accompanied by text mocking their decision. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY JUST REMEMBER'. Central image shows close-up of person's lower leg/calf area. Person wears dark gray or black pants rolled up to mid-calf, green sock pulled down to ankle, and black sneaker. Skin visible on calf shows large tattoo of NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circular background with red chevron wing, white 'NASA' text, white stars, and orbital trajectory line. Tattoo appears professionally done with clean lines and solid colors, approximately 4-5 inches diameter covering significant portion of calf. Colors vibrant and distinct - deep blue background, bright red chevron, clean white elements. Tattoo relatively new based on sharp appearance without fading. Background shows indoor setting with beige/tan speckled floor (appears to be commercial flooring like restaurant, office, or public building) and dark wooden furniture leg visible on left. Lighting suggests indoor fluorescent or LED illumination. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'YOU COULD BE THIS GUY'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme mocks person who got permanent NASA tattoo, suggesting they'll regret decision once they 'learn the truth' about space agency. Flat Earth community views NASA as primary organization perpetuating globe Earth 'lie' through fake space missions, CGI images, propaganda. Implies person blindly trusted NASA enough to permanently ink logo on body but will eventually discover agency is fraudulent, leaving them with embarrassing permanent reminder of their 'gullibility'. Humor derives from imagined future regret - being stuck with NASA tattoo after becoming flat Earth believer would create awkward situation. Would require expensive laser removal, cover-up tattoo, or living with constant reminder of former beliefs. Format of 'having a bad day? at least you're not this guy' is common meme template for schadenfreude - taking comfort in others' misfortunes or poor decisions. However, NASA has successfully executed numerous space missions over 60+ years providing satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting, Earth observation, planetary exploration, International Space Station operations. Thousands of photos, livestreams, returned samples, astronaut testimony from multiple nations all confirm space agency's accomplishments. Person with NASA tattoo likely space enthusiast, employee, or someone inspired by scientific achievement. From mainstream perspective, NASA tattoo represents admiration for human achievement, scientific progress, space exploration - nothing to regret. Only within flat Earth worldview does tattoo become embarrassing. Meme reveals flat Earth community's certainty that their beliefs are correct and others will eventually recognize it, experiencing regret for supporting mainstream science5:T923,Satirical photoshopped meme showing Barack Obama seated at Resolute Desk in Oval Office with comically oversized pear-shaped Earth globe positioned prominently on desk beside him. President Obama appears to be signing document in blue folder while large distorted globe dominates right side of frame. Text at bottom reads "EXECUTIVE ORDER #109779 I HEREBY PRONOUNCE THE EARTH TO BE PEAR SHAPED SIGNED - BARACK OBAMA". Image mocks scientific statement made by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (meaning it bulges at equator due to rotation) and specifically that it's "pear-shaped" in sense that Southern Hemisphere is slightly wider than Northern Hemisphere - difference of approximately 0.3%. Meme takes Tyson's technically accurate but easily misunderstood description and exaggerates it to absurd proportion, showing globe that's dramatically pear-shaped like fruit rather than subtle oblate spheroid. This is common flat Earth argument strategy: take nuanced scientific statement about Earth's imperfect sphericity (equatorial diameter 7,926 miles vs polar diameter 7,900 miles - difference of only 26 miles or 0.3%) and portray it as admission that globe Earth model is inconsistent or constantly changing. Reality: Earth is indeed not perfect sphere - it's oblate spheroid due to centrifugal force from rotation causing equatorial bulge, and there are additional minor irregularities in shape due to variations in gravitational field and mass distribution. Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment referred to fact that equatorial bulge is slightly larger in Southern Hemisphere than Northern (difference measured in meters, not miles), making Earth very slightly asymmetric. This is measured precisely by satellites using laser altimetry and confirmed by gravitational measurements. Photoshopped globe in image is obviously exaggerated parody - actual Earth's deviation from perfect sphere is less than 0.35%, imperceptible to naked eye from space. Authentic Oval Office setting includes presidential seal on chair back, American flag, windows with gold drapes visible in background, red leather chair, wooden desk with papers. Attribution: "fb.com/fematters" watermark at bottom. Meme conflates "not perfectly spherical" with "not spherical at all" - logical fallacy common in flat Earth argumentation.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-329","title":"Other 329","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12798931_470593886473684_3704752133026437014_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-328","title":"Other 328","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12795399_469306029935803_3961592836711624466_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-330","title":"Other 330","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12798942_469408643258875_6491435334159942430_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
