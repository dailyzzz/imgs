Authors: Eugene L. Duke, Robert F. Antoniewicz, and Keith D. Krambeer. Performed by NASA Ames Research Center Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA. Abstract section contains prominent red text stating 'flying over a flat, nonrotating earth'. Full abstract describes derivation of linear aircraft model for rigid aircraft of constant mass flying over flat, nonrotating earth. Document shows standard NASA form layout with various administrative fields. Report number H-1391, work unit RTOP 505-66-11. Classification: Unclassified.
