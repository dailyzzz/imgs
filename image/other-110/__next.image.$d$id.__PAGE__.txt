Background shows American flag on left and space shuttle on right. Donkey has wide-eyed excited expression with open-mouth smile showing teeth. NASA logos in top corners altered to read 'LIARS' in red text with red slashes through them. Header reads 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS fb.com/fematters'. Main text box states 'NASA: \"nasha\" in ancient Hebrew can also be spelled without the 'h'. It is pronounced naw-shaw, and means \"a great deception\" or \"to deceive\".' Below shows dictionary entry excerpt: '+5377 נָשָׁא nāšā', v. GK: 5958 [→ 4860, 4876]. [N] to be deceived; [H] to deceive:– deceive [7], deceived [4], greatly deceived (+5377) [2], beguiled [1], seize [1], utterly forget (+5382) [1]'. Presents Hebrew etymology suggesting NASA's name means 'deception', implying organization is inherently deceptive.

Red banner at top with blue Earth image reads 'IN THE GLOBALIZED WORLD...' Below shows three photo examples with labels: Left - soldiers in desert with military equipment labeled 'WARS bring peace', Center - pile of colorful pharmaceutical pills labeled 'DRUGS bring health', Right - colorful credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) labeled 'DEBT brings wealth'. Uses Orwellian doublespeak showing how negative things (war, drugs, debt) are marketed as positive. Black section below shows spherical Earth image with white text: '...and our world is a floating pear that came from nothing.' Uses pear-shaped Earth image (slightly elongated at bottom) to mock globe Earth model, suggesting it's another absurd globalization narrative alongside wars/drugs/debt propaganda.

Connects flat Earth skepticism to broader critique of mainstream narratives and social engineering"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-111","title":"Other 111","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10341689_475055729360833_4093670835672127601_n.jpg","description":"Twilight Zone meme featuring Rod Serling in classic black and white portrait photograph. Shows Serling in suit and tie with slicked-back dark hair, trademark slight smile, against neutral gray background. Image evokes iconic opening sequences from The Twilight Zone television series where Serling introduced each episode's premise. Top text reads 'IMAGINE IF YOU WILL' in white bold letters (Serling's signature phrase). Bottom text states 'A WORLD FULL OF PEOPLE LIVING UPSIDE DOWN ON A SPINNING BALL'. Top right watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Uses Twilight Zone format to present spherical Earth concept as absurd science fiction premise worthy of anthology series about bizarre alternate realities. Suggests living on spinning globe is as fantastical as Twilight Zone episodes. Employs Serling's authoritative narration style and show's reputation for mind-bending scenarios to frame heliocentric model as implausible fiction rather than reality"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
