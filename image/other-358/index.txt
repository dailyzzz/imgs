13:T18f5,Six-panel water level collage arguing water always finding level proves flat Earth. Photo compilation showing various water scenes with text claiming water's behavior confirms Earth must be flat. Layout shows 2x3 grid of six photographs depicting water in different contexts, all supposedly demonstrating water's tendency to find horizontal level surface. Top row left: Pristine tropical beach scene showing turquoise ocean water meeting white sandy beach. Water appears absolutely flat and calm extending to horizon. Horizon line perfectly straight cutting across frame horizontally. Sky above shows light blue with few white clouds. Water surface mirror-smooth suggesting no wind, creating glassy appearance. Beach in foreground shows white sand with gentle surf. Top row center: Scientific demonstration apparatus - communicating vessels physics experiment showing connected tubes. Laboratory equipment shows clear glass U-tubes or interconnected vessels mounted on stand. Blue liquid (likely colored water) fills connected tubes showing equal water level across all vessels regardless of tube shape or position. Classic physics demonstration that connected vessels reach same level due to gravity and pressure equilibrium. Illustrates hydrostatic principle that fluid surface in connected containers reaches same height. Top row right: Canal or waterway photograph showing straight man-made channel extending into distance. Water surface appears perfectly flat and calm like mirror, reflecting sky and surroundings. Canal banks show green grass, brick building on right side, tree vegetation. Long straight waterway emphasizes flat water surface extending to vanishing point in distance. Typical European-style canal with geometric precision. Bottom row left: Aerial photograph of coastline showing boundary between ocean and land. View from high altitude (aircraft or satellite) showing deep blue ocean water meeting lighter colored shallow water near shore. Landmass shows tan/brown coloring suggesting beach or shallow sandy bottom. Water surface appears uniform and level from aerial perspective. Bottom row center: Aerial view of meandering river through landscape. Photograph taken from high altitude showing river with multiple curves creating snake-like S-curve pattern through darker landscape. River appears light colored (possibly silt-laden water reflecting sky) creating strong contrast with dark surrounding terrain. Water follows natural course through terrain showing typical river meandering behavior. Surface appears level/horizontal from overhead perspective. Bottom row right: Another aerial river view showing winding river through landscape. Similar to previous image but different river system, showing multiple S-curves. River appears lighter colored against darker landscape, creating beautiful organic sinuous patterns. View emphasizes how rivers create level water surfaces following lowest elevation paths through terrain. Text overlay at bottom spanning width in large bold white letters with black outline: "WATER WILL ALWAYS FIND ITS LEVEL" with word "LEVEL" emphasized in larger text. Top left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Collage's argument: Water naturally seeks and maintains horizontal level surface. All six images show flat water surfaces (ocean, canals, rivers, laboratory vessels). Since Earth is mostly covered by water and water finds level, Earth must be flat. If Earth were sphere, water would curve with it, but we observe flat water surfaces, therefore Earth is flat. However, argument fundamentally misunderstands what "level" means and operates at wrong scale. Scientific explanation: "Level" doesn't mean geometrically flat in absolute sense - it means perpendicular to gravity gradient. Water finds level relative to local gravitational potential, which on spherical Earth means following curvature. Water surface is perpendicular to direction of gravity (equipotential surface). On sphere, gravity points toward center from all locations, so water surface curves following sphere's shape while appearing "level" locally. All six images show water at scale too small to detect Earth's curvature: 1) Beach horizon extends only ~3 miles from ground-level observer - over 3-mile distance, Earth curves approximately 6 feet, imperceptible to eye as distinct curve from beach level. 2) Communicating vessels demonstrate hydrostatic pressure equilibrium - water seeks same gravitational potential energy level in connected containers. On spherical Earth, this still produces level surfaces because experiment operates at tiny scale (inches to feet) where curvature is negligible. 3-6) Canals and rivers appear flat because they extend only tens of miles maximum in frame - insufficient distance to show obvious curvature. At larger scales, water demonstrably curves: Ships disappear hull-first over horizon because water curves downward away from observer. Distance to horizon increases with observer height, matching spherical Earth calculation. Ocean bulges at equator due to centrifugal force from Earth's rotation - wouldn't occur on flat plane. Tides result from Moon's gravity creating bulges in water on opposite sides of spherical Earth. GPS systems work using satellites in orbit - require spherical Earth with curved water surface to function. If Earth were truly flat infinite plane, water couldn't have "edge" - would flow infinitely or need impossible containment. Communicating vessels principle works identically on spherical Earth - water in connected tubes reaches same distance from Earth's center (same gravitational potential), appearing level locally while following global curvature. Rivers flowing to sea demonstrate gravity pointing toward Earth's center, not uniform "down" direction. Rivers in different locations flow in different compass directions but all "downhill" toward sea level - wouldn't occur if gravity pointed in single absolute direction as flat Earth requires. Meme conflates "locally flat" with "globally flat." At human scale on planet with 7,917-mile diameter, surfaces appear flat - but this is scale illusion, not evidence of actual flatness. Same principle as tabletop appearing flat despite being on curved Earth. Water always finding "level" actually proves spherical Earth - level means equipotential surface, which on sphere is curved surface equidistant from center.14:T16f8,Relative versus universal gravity direction infographic comparing globe and flat Earth models. Two-panel educational-style diagram contrasting how "up" and "down" work on spherical Earth versus flat Earth, arguing for universal absolute directions. Black background with white text creating stark high-contrast design. Top panel labeled "RELATIVE" shows globe Earth model. Left side displays multiple small spherical Earths arranged in circle, each showing different orientation. Each Earth shows blue oceans, green-brown continents, white clouds. From each Earth, colored arrows point in different directions indicating "up" and "down" relative to that Earth's surface. Red arrows labeled "UP" point away from Earth's surface (radially outward). Red arrows labeled "DOWN" point toward Earth's center. Green/teal arrows labeled "DOWN" also shown. Small white human figure icons positioned on some Earth surfaces showing different orientations - one standing upright, one sideways, one upside-down relative to viewer's perspective, demonstrating how "down" changes depending on location on sphere. Arrows show gravity vectors pointing toward each Earth's center from all surface points. Center shows directional indicators suggesting motion or rotation with white arrows. Right side shows large text "RELATIVE" in white capital letters emphasizing concept that directions are location-dependent on globe. Bottom panel labeled "UNIVERSAL" shows flat Earth model. Image displays classic flat Earth dome/snow globe model - circular flat disc under transparent dome. Earth disc shows continents arranged flat with North Pole at center (azimuthal equidistant projection), surrounded by ocean, Antarctica forming ice ring around perimeter. Dome over Earth rendered semi-transparent showing curve. Sun and moon visible as small luminous bodies inside dome. Flat plane appears level/horizontal. White arrows at left and right edges point upward labeled "UP" in white text with white arrows. Red arrows at left and right edges point downward labeled "DOWN" in red text with red downward arrows. Arrows indicate universal absolute directions - up is always perpendicular to flat plane upward, down always perpendicular downward toward underside of plane. No variation based on location - all points on flat Earth share same "up" and "down." Large text "UNIVERSAL" in white capital letters emphasizes concept of absolute unchanging directions. Bottom attribution "fb.com/oierraeplana" in red on white background. Diagram argues flat Earth superior because provides absolute reference frame with universal directions, while globe Earth has relative directions that change based on position. Suggests absurdity of "relative" directions where people in Australia are "upside down" relative to people in North America. Implies globe model is unintuitive or nonsensical. However, diagram misrepresents physics and creates false problem. Scientific reality: "Down" on spherical Earth is not arbitrary or confusing - it's simply direction toward Earth's center, defined by gravity. Gravity on sphere points radially inward toward center of mass. This creates consistent local reference frame at every location - "down" means toward ground, "up" means away from ground, regardless of where you are on planet. Observers at all locations experience same sensation - standing upright on ground surface with sky above. No one is actually "upside down" because "down" is defined by gravity, not by external geometric reference frame. On spherical Earth with uniform gravity, each location has own local vertical, but all verticals point toward Earth's center - this is feature, not bug. Allows consistent physics everywhere. Standing in Australia feels identical to standing in North America - both experience gravity pulling feet toward ground. "Relative" is not problem but solution - it's how physics actually works through reference frames. Flat Earth model in diagram creates actual problems diagram doesn't address: 1) If down is truly universal (same direction everywhere), gravity would need to point in same absolute direction from all locations on flat plane. This would mean gravity points toward geometric center of disc (not uniformly "down"). People near edges would experience gravity pulling them toward center, not straight down through ground. 2) Universal down contradicts observation - we measure gravity pointing perpendicular to local ground everywhere. If plane were truly flat with universal down, gravity measurements would vary with position on disc. 3) Dome model shown has no physical basis - what material is dome? What holds it up? Why does sun/moon move inside dome? How do spacecraft exit? Diagram's visual appeal comes from simplicity - flat plane with uniform directions seems intuitively easier to understand than sphere with location-dependent directions. However, intuition based on limited experience. We live on such large sphere that we experience only tiny fraction of surface at once, making it appear flat. Once scale is understood, spherical model with radial gravity is both simpler (follows from mass distribution) and matches all observations. "Relative" vs "Universal" framing is false dichotomy. Physical laws are universal - gravity always points toward center of mass. What changes is local expression of universal law. On sphere, universal gravity law creates location-dependent vertical directions. On hypothetical flat plane, same gravity law would create completely different (and non-observed) effects. Diagram essentially argues: "wouldn't it be nice if Earth were flat so directions were simpler?" But universe doesn't conform to human preference for simplicity. Actual observations (ships over horizon, different star constellations in different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, satellite orbits) all confirm spherical Earth with radial gravity.15:T1a1d,Spirit level tool on desert landscape questioning lack of visible curvature over 100-mile horizon. Photograph showing carpenter's level tool positioned across wide landscape view with text challenging Earth curvature visibility. Image shows expansive desert or arid landscape view from elevated vantage point. Terrain appears relatively flat or gently rolling with minimal vertical relief. Landscape shows tan/brown earth tones suggesting desert, badlands, or arid region. Scattered vegetation visible as darker patches - appears to be scrub brush, small trees, or desert plants creating texture across terrain. Terrain shows various geological features - what appear to be mesas, buttes, or eroded formations characteristic of desert Southwest United States. Atmospheric perspective makes distant features appear hazier and bluer. Horizon line cuts across image showing transition between land and sky. Horizon appears straight from this viewing angle spanning width of frame. Sky above shows clear blue color with few scattered white clouds - high desert sky with excellent visibility. Lighting suggests midday or afternoon sun creating shadows defining terrain features. Overlaid on landscape photograph is image of carpenter's level (spirit level) - construction tool used to determine whether surface is horizontal/level. Level appears as bright orange/red rectangular tool with black ends showing typical torpedo level or box level design. Level shows multiple vial windows (bubble vials) containing liquid with air bubbles - these indicate whether surface is level when bubble centers between marks. Level positioned horizontally across frame as if measuring horizon's levelness. Level's placement creates visual suggestion that horizon line (representing Earth's surface over distance) registers as perfectly level on tool, implying no curvature detected. Tool's presence serves as "proof" that Earth is flat. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "THAT'S OVER 100 MILES OF HORIZON" claiming vast distance visible in photograph. Second line below in slightly smaller white text: "WHERE IS THE CURVATURE?" posing rhetorical question challenging absence of visible curve. Below that in lighter gray/transparent text: "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" - movement slogan. Bottom left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text on dark background. Meme's argument: Photograph shows over 100 miles of horizon (assuming high vantage point with excellent visibility). Horizon appears perfectly straight, registers as level on carpenter's level. If Earth were sphere, horizon should show obvious curvature over 100-mile span. Since no curvature visible, Earth must be flat. Spirit level confirms horizon is truly level (flat), not curved. However, multiple problems with argument: 1) SCALE MISUNDERSTANDING: Even viewing 100 miles of horizon from elevated position, curvature of Earth (7,917-mile diameter) appears extremely subtle. Curvature becomes visible to human eye only with very wide field of view or from high altitude (typically 35,000+ feet for subtle detection, 60,000+ feet for clear perception). From ground level or modest elevation (few hundred to few thousand feet), 100-mile horizon shows curvature drop of only ~1-2 degrees across entire visible arc - below threshold for perception as curved line versus straight line in narrow field of view. 2) VIEWING ANGLE: Photograph appears taken from elevated desert overlook, perhaps few hundred to few thousand feet altitude. At this height, visible horizon extends perhaps 60-80 miles at most, not 100+ miles. Atmospheric haze limits visibility further. Horizon might span 100 miles total if considering full 360-degree view, but photo shows only narrow slice (maybe 90-120 degrees field of view), meaning visible horizon arc much shorter. 3) SPIRIT LEVEL MISUSE: Carpenter's level is precision tool designed for small-scale construction projects (measuring surfaces in feet/meters). Bubble vial indicates whether surface is perpendicular to local gravity. On spherical Earth, "level" means perpendicular to gravity vector pointing toward Earth's center - not geometrically parallel to straight line. Level placed at any location on Earth reads "level" when perpendicular to local vertical, regardless of planet's overall curvature. Level cannot detect Earth's curvature because it measures local gravitational vertical, which by definition is perpendicular to surface. If Earth were 100 miles wide (vastly smaller than reality), level would still read "level" at any point on surface. 4) PERSPECTIVE: Horizon in photograph likely appears straight because it IS straight within frame - straight line is projection of curved horizon onto narrow field of view. Curvature only appears when viewing wide enough arc. Analogy: holding string along basketball's surface - over few inches, string appears to match curve, but can't see overall curvature by examining short segment. 5) PHOTOGRAPH PROPERTIES: Image shows narrow horizontal slice of view. Lens focal length, field of view, and framing all affect how curvature appears. Standard lenses (not fish-eye) show little curvature because they capture limited horizontal span. Wide-angle lenses can make even flat lines appear curved. Curvature requires specific viewing conditions to be obvious. Mathematical calculation: From 1,000-foot elevation (generous estimate for desert overlook), distance to horizon = √(2 × radius × height) = √(2 × 3,959 miles × 0.189 miles) ≈ 39 miles. Even assuming 2,000-foot elevation extends horizon to ~55 miles. Over this distance, Earth curves such that horizon dips ~0.5-0.7 degrees from horizontal tangent at observer - imperceptible as curve in narrow view. Actual evidence for curvature visible from ground: Ships disappearing hull-first over ocean horizon (easily observed with binoculars), different portions of sky visible from different latitudes (different star constellations), shadows falling at different angles at same time in locations separated by latitude (Eratosthenes experiment), sunrise/sunset occurring at different times across longitudes (time zones). These observations possible from ground level, require no special equipment, and directly demonstrate curvature. Meme's "100 miles" claim likely exaggerated. Standard visibility even in clear desert conditions limited to 60-100 miles maximum due to atmospheric scattering. Photograph shows far less. Spirit level as "proof" is prop creating false authority - construction tool meant for local measurements can't detect planetary-scale curvature. Equivalent to using ruler to measure Earth's circumference - wrong tool, wrong scale.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-358","title":"Other 358","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814597_472357126297360_3879395302244326243_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-357","title":"Other 357","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814526_469338236599249_4584590810737124001_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-359","title":"Other 359","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814615_470909543108785_1266191908909155172_n.png","description":"$15"}}]
