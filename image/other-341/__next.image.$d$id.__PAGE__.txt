3:T1156,"They Live" meme format revealing "truth" about flat Earth using special sunglasses concept. Four-panel grid meme adapting iconic 1988 John Carpenter film "They Live" where protagonist discovers special sunglasses revealing hidden messages and alien infiltration invisible to normal vision. Format became popular template for conspiracy theories suggesting hidden truths visible only to awakened individuals. Top left panel shows man (appears to be from "They Live" film - Roddy Piper's character "Nada") with light brown/blonde mullet hairstyle wearing green and black plaid flannel shirt, pulling sunglasses down slightly to peer over top of frames with skeptical suspicious expression. Eyes narrowed, eyebrows furrowed. Interior setting with bookshelves, magazines, papers visible in background suggesting library or bookstore. Natural lighting from side. Top right panel shows black background with white text at top: "YOU LIVE ON A SPINNING BALL". Below text displays photograph of Earth from space - classic "Blue Marble" style image showing full sphere with blue oceans, white cloud formations, green-brown continents clearly visible. Earth appears as globe floating in black space. This represents "normal" view that mainstream society accepts. Bottom left panel shows same man now fully wearing large black sunglasses covering eyes completely. Same plaid shirt and bookshelf background. Expression more serious/determined. Sunglasses represent "seeing the truth" - special vision that penetrates propaganda. In "They Live" film, glasses revealed subliminal messages like "OBEY" and "CONSUME" hidden in media/advertising. Here, metaphorically represents awakening to flat Earth "truth." Bottom right panel shows black background with white text at top: "THE EARTH IS FLAT AND STATIONARY". Below displays azimuthal equidistant projection map (Gleason's map) - circular flat Earth representation with North Pole at center, continents arranged radially outward, Antarctica as ice ring around outer edge. Map shows gridlines creating concentric circles and radial lines. Continents appear in tan/beige, oceans in blue-teal. This represents "hidden truth" supposedly revealed when viewing world through "awakened" lens. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Meme's message: without special insight (sunglasses), people see/believe Earth is spinning globe as taught by establishment. With awakened vision/critical thinking (putting on glasses), "truth" reveals Earth is actually flat stationary plane. Implies: 1) Globe Earth is illusion/propaganda maintained by media/education/government, 2) Flat Earth is objective reality hidden from masses, 3) Only those who "wake up" and question mainstream narratives can see truth, 4) Flat Earth believers are like "They Live" protagonist - enlightened minority who see through deception. Format highly effective in conspiracy communities because it: 1) Frames belief as special knowledge/vision, 2) Positions believers as enlightened heroes, 3) Suggests mainstream view is programmed false reality, 4) Uses familiar pop culture reference making message accessible/shareable. However, comparison to fiction film is ironic - "They Live" was science fiction satire, not documentary. Earth's sphericity isn't hidden truth requiring special vision - observable through direct experiments anyone can perform: watching ships disappear hull-first over horizon, observing different star constellations in different hemispheres, witnessing lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow on moon, measuring stick shadows at different latitudes (Eratosthenes experiment), circumnavigating globe. "Spinning ball" description technically accurate: Earth rotates 360° every 24 hours (15°/hour), orbits sun at 67,000 mph. Motion imperceptible because it's constant velocity without acceleration. Meme's rhetorical power comes from emotional appeal rather than evidence - feeling of being enlightened elite who sees "truth" masses cannot. "They Live" format particularly popular in conspiracy communities for topics like fake moon landings, chemtrails, 9/11 theories, COVID conspiracies - anything suggesting mainstream reality is fabricated illusion. Film's anti-establishment, anti-authority themes resonate with conspiracy worldview. Original film was actually Reagan-era critique of consumerism and conformity, but has been adopted by various movements as metaphor for their particular "hidden truths."4:T1035,Conspiracy theory meme showing distorted Earth globe being crushed between hands with text suggesting one discovered lie invalidates all truths. Dramatic image presenting epistemological argument central to conspiracy thinking. Composition shows spherical Earth globe being squeezed/crushed between two hands creating visual metaphor for manufactured/manipulated reality. Earth appears as photographic sphere showing recognizable features: blue oceans dominating surface, green-yellow landmasses visible including clear outline of North America on left side, white cloud formations swirling across surface, South America partially visible, Atlantic Ocean in center. Globe shows realistic Earth photography, possibly based on satellite imagery. However, globe is dramatically distorted - compressed and warped between hands creating unnatural bulges and deformations, suggesting Earth's spherical shape is artificial construct being forced/manipulated rather than natural reality. Hands enter frame from left and right sides, fingers wrapped around globe squeezing it. Hands appear as dark silhouettes/shadows with minimal detail visible, creating anonymous ominous presence. Hands' squeezing creates stress patterns and distortions in globe image. Background shows abstract monochrome pattern suggesting clouds, smoke, or fabric with sweeping curved lines in black, white, and gray tones creating dynamic movement. Texture has almost marble or swirl effect suggesting chaos or instability. Right side displays bold black text overlaid on lighter background: "ONE LIE IS ENOUGH TO QUESTION... ALL 'TRUTHS'" with strategic emphasis - "ALL" underlined with double line, "'TRUTHS'" in quotation marks suggesting ironic or disputed meaning of word. Text presents core conspiracy theory reasoning: once establishment caught in one deception, everything they claim becomes suspect. If authorities lied about one thing, logically they might lie about everything. Quotation marks around "TRUTHS" suggests what mainstream calls truths are actually lies. Bottom left corner shows "flat earth matters" watermark in light blue/cyan lowercase text. Bottom right shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution on black background. Image's central argument embodies slippery slope reasoning common in conspiracy communities: discovery of any falsehood (real or perceived) used to justify wholesale rejection of mainstream knowledge. If globe Earth is lie (conspiracy theory premise), then biology, physics, astronomy, geology, history - all "establishment" knowledge becomes questionable because all taught by same supposedly deceptive institutions. This binary thinking presents false dichotomy: either trust everything authorities say, or trust nothing. Psychological appeal is strong - image empowers believers to feel they've seen through grand deception that fools masses. Finding "one lie" becomes license to reconstruct entire reality according to alternative narratives. Visual metaphor of hands crushing globe suggests: 1) Spherical Earth is artificially maintained illusion, 2) Hidden forces (governments, NASA, media) deliberately distort/manipulate reality, 3) True shape of Earth being suppressed by propaganda pressure. However, epistemological framework is flawed: 1) Institutions can be wrong about specific claims while right about others - nuanced evaluation required, 2) Scientific claims verified through replicable observation/experiment, not authority, 3) Finding error in one area doesn't invalidate unrelated fields, 4) Globe Earth supported by thousands of independent observations anyone can verify personally. Quotation marks on "truths" employ postmodern relativism suggesting objective truth is merely narrative construct, yet flat Earthers simultaneously claim absolute certainty about Earth's shape. Self-contradiction: dismissing mainstream "truths" as uncertain while promoting flat Earth as certain truth. Distorted globe imagery is powerful propaganda - visceral image of manipulation easier to internalize than complex evidence evaluation. Format designed for social media sharing in conspiracy communities as "red pill" awakening content.5:T1199,High-altitude photograph mocking curvature observations with toy rocket and insult. Image shows stratospheric view with toy rocket figurine superimposed against dramatic high-altitude sky and Earth below. Upper portion displays deep blue gradient sky transitioning from dark blue-purple at top to lighter blue-white toward horizon - characteristic of upper atmosphere/stratosphere where air thins. Sky shows subtle gradient indicating altitude between troposphere and space. Horizon line visible cutting across middle of frame shows gentle curve from left to right - actual Earth's curvature visible at high altitude. Below horizon shows Earth's surface - appears as layer of white clouds creating textured blanket covering ground below. Clouds show three-dimensional depth with shadows and highlights. Curvature of horizon is noticeable though subtle, consistent with photographs taken from high-altitude balloons or aircraft at 60,000-100,000+ feet altitude. Center of frame shows toy rocket model - appears to be plastic children's toy or model rocket approximately 6-12 inches tall positioned to appear as if "launching" upward through atmosphere. Rocket design: white cylindrical fuselage/body with clear or translucent dome at top (payload section or nosecone), red/maroon colored base section (likely representing engine/propellant section), wide stabilizing fins extending from base in tripod configuration (three fins visible). Rocket positioned vertically with nose pointing upward. Toy appears held or suspended in front of camera at close range while background shows actual high-altitude view - classic forced perspective technique. Scale of toy versus background creates impossible scene as if tiny toy has reached edge of space. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "IF YOU THINK YOU SEE A CURVE" - directly addressing viewer who might observe Earth's curvature in image. Bottom text in matching style: "THEN YOU JUST WENT FULL POTATO" - internet slang insult derived from "went full retard" phrase from 2008 film "Tropic Thunder" where character says "never go full retard." "Potato" substituted as less offensive version meaning acting extremely stupid or having brain like potato. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Meme's intention is mocking people who claim to see Earth's curvature in high-altitude photographs, suggesting they're idiots whose eyes deceive them. However, image contains ironic self-contradiction: photograph DOES actually show Earth's curvature - horizon displays gentle arc consistent with viewing spherical planet from high altitude. Curvature becomes visible to human eye at altitudes above approximately 35,000 feet (commercial aircraft cruising altitude), though subtle. Becomes more pronounced at 60,000-100,000+ feet (high-altitude balloon range). This image appears to be from such altitude based on darkness of sky, visible horizon arc, and cloud layer below. Scientific fact: Earth's curvature is real and measurable. Horizon dip and curve can be calculated geometrically based on observer altitude and Earth's radius (3,959 miles). From sea level, horizon appears flat because observer sees only ~3 miles to horizon (based on 6-foot observer height) - too small to detect curvature. As altitude increases, visible horizon extends farther and curvature becomes apparent. Amateur high-altitude balloon launches regularly photograph Earth from 100,000+ feet showing clear curvature. Felix Baumgartner's 2012 Red Bull Stratos jump from 128,100 feet showed pronounced curvature. Meme attempts to gaslight viewers into disbelieving their own observations by ridiculing curvature perception. Strategy suggests: 1) Curvature in photos is optical illusion or lens distortion (fish-eye effect), 2) Anyone claiming to see curvature is gullible fool, 3) Horizon is actually flat as shown by "true" observations. However, while extreme fish-eye lenses do exaggerate curvature, standard lenses at sufficient altitude show real gentle curvature matching mathematical predictions for spherical Earth. Toy rocket inclusion adds dismissive mockery - suggesting space exploration itself is childish fantasy like toy rockets. Combining actual curvature evidence with insult creates cognitive dissonance: image proves what text denies. Effectiveness depends on viewer's existing beliefs - flat Earth believers see it as mockery of globe believers; mainstream viewers see self-defeating argument undermined by own evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-341","title":"Other 341","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802824_473127696220303_3868938798963817652_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-340","title":"Other 340","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801685_469030176630055_2515854307401806422_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-342","title":"Other 342","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802872_469146956618377_5555612780781728761_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
