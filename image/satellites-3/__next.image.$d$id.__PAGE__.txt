Shows browser at google.com with search interface (ALL, IMAGES, VIDEOS, NEWS, MAPS tabs). Main result shows large white inflated balloon being prepared on ground with yellow launch equipment/crane, people working, mountains in background. Google result labeled 'NASA' with title 'NASA Super Pressure Balloon Begins Globetrotting Journey | ...' and subtitle 'Scientific Balloons · Super Pressure Balloon launch'. Copyright notice and 'RELATED IMAGES' section visible with thumbnail images. Bottom shows related NASA.gov result. Image suggests NASA uses high-altitude balloons for atmospheric research, potentially conflated with orbital satellites in flat Earth arguments.
