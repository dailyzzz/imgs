3:T5f8,Density column experiment with layered liquids and objects demonstrating buoyancy. Shows tall clear glass cylinder or vase containing density tower science experiment against white background. Multiple colored liquids stacked in distinct horizontal layers from bottom to top, separated by surface tension and density differences. Bottom layer: golden-amber honey with small metal bolt resting at bottom. Second layer: tan-beige corn syrup. Third layer: darker brown (appears to be 100% maple syrup). Fourth layer: white opaque milk with popcorn kernel floating at interface. Fifth layer: clear or pale liquid (dish soap). Sixth layer: light blue-green water with red cherry tomato suspended at level. Seventh layer: clear liquid (vegetable oil). Eighth layer: purple-blue liquid (rubbing alcohol) with small plastic beads floating. Ninth layer: bright red liquid (lamp oil). Top: white ping pong ball floating on surface with white plastic soda bottle cap below it. Left side shows black text labels identifying each liquid layer. Right side shows red text labels identifying floating objects at each density level. Demonstrates principle of density and buoyancy - denser materials sink to bottom, less dense materials float on top. Each object floats at layer matching its own density. Flat Earth proponents use this to argue buoyancy and density explain rising/falling without requiring gravity. Claim objects naturally seek their density level in medium rather than being pulled by gravitational force toward planetary center4:T5ce,Dramatic Antarctic ice shelf wall meeting ocean from aerial perspective. Shows breathtaking aerial photograph of Antarctic ice formation from elevated viewpoint looking along ice edge. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates right side and background - perfectly flat white-gray ice surface extending to horizon creating geometric plane. Ice shows subtle surface variations, crevasses, and textural details. Most striking feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets water - clean straight edge running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified layers of compressed ice and snow in white and blue-gray bands. Face shows some irregularities, overhangs, and ice chunks that have calved off. Left side shows dark navy-blue to black ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, small icebergs floating on surface. Two small turquoise-blue ice chunks or small bergs visible in lower left. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast with bright white ice. Sky shows overcast gray-white conditions typical of Antarctic weather. Horizon line in far distance. No text or watermarks visible. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing ocean water from spilling off edges and restricting access to whatever lies beyond Antarctic perimeter5:T652,Apollo spacecraft cutaway diagram questioning astronaut transfer between modules. Shows technical illustration of complete Apollo spacecraft stack in space against black starfield background. Diagram labeled 'SATURN V' and 'APOLLO SPACECRAFT' at top. Detailed cutaway reveals interior components and crew spaces. From left to right: conical white Command Module at front with cramped crew cabin visible inside, cylindrical Service Module behind it showing fuel tanks and engine components, narrow cylindrical tunnel/docking adapter connecting to Lunar Module. Lunar Module shown with distinctive angular gold-foil wrapped descent stage at bottom and ascent stage with crew cabin at top. Two large yellow arrows with three question marks (???) point to the narrow tunnel/passage between Command Module and Lunar Module. Labels identify major components: 'BOOST PROTECTIVE COVER', 'LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM', 'ENGINE', 'COMMAND MODULE', 'SERVICE MODULE', 'LM ADAPTER', 'LUNAR MODULE'. Top text in large yellow letters asks: 'HOW DID THE ASTRONAUTS GET FROM THE COMMAND MODULE TO THE LUNAR MODULE?' Bottom text in yellow: 'DID THEY CLIMB THROUGH THE ENGINE?' Bottom right shows 'MISC-47-MS-G-1551-G' reference number. Signature 'Nick Havok'. Moon landing skeptics question how astronauts in bulky pressurized spacesuits could fit through narrow docking tunnel to transfer between spacecraft. Actual procedure involved astronauts removing suits, crawling through 32-inch diameter tunnel in shirtsleeves after docking. Question 'climb through engine' is strawman - engine is in Service Module, separate from docking tunnel path0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-235","title":"Other 235","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670100_463799087153164_5975624137514349673_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-234","title":"Other 234","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669527_461770220689384_4205422869487854845_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-236","title":"Other 236","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670496_485633281636411_4050423841817880851_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
