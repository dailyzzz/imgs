5:T5f8,Density column experiment with layered liquids and objects demonstrating buoyancy. Shows tall clear glass cylinder or vase containing density tower science experiment against white background. Multiple colored liquids stacked in distinct horizontal layers from bottom to top, separated by surface tension and density differences. Bottom layer: golden-amber honey with small metal bolt resting at bottom. Second layer: tan-beige corn syrup. Third layer: darker brown (appears to be 100% maple syrup). Fourth layer: white opaque milk with popcorn kernel floating at interface. Fifth layer: clear or pale liquid (dish soap). Sixth layer: light blue-green water with red cherry tomato suspended at level. Seventh layer: clear liquid (vegetable oil). Eighth layer: purple-blue liquid (rubbing alcohol) with small plastic beads floating. Ninth layer: bright red liquid (lamp oil). Top: white ping pong ball floating on surface with white plastic soda bottle cap below it. Left side shows black text labels identifying each liquid layer. Right side shows red text labels identifying floating objects at each density level. Demonstrates principle of density and buoyancy - denser materials sink to bottom, less dense materials float on top. Each object floats at layer matching its own density. Flat Earth proponents use this to argue buoyancy and density explain rising/falling without requiring gravity. Claim objects naturally seek their density level in medium rather than being pulled by gravitational force toward planetary center0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 235 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Density column experiment with layered liquids and objects demonstrating buoyancy.
