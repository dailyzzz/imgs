Top panel shows photograph of Jim Carrey smiling, with quote text: 'DON'T WORRY FOLKS AS LONG AS THE SUN IS REVOLVING AROUND THE EARTH WE'LL BE FINE!' with timestamp '2:13 PM - NOV 9, 2016'. Bottom panel shows upward view through tree canopy with bright sun shining through leaves and branches creating dramatic lens flare and light rays. Uses Jim Carrey quote to promote geocentric model where sun orbits Earth rather than heliocentric model where Earth orbits sun. Quote format suggests tweet or social media post. Image presents geocentrism as reassuring or common-sense position, with bright sun photograph through trees providing visual emphasis. Note: No verified record of Jim Carrey making this specific statement exists"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-13","title":"The Sun 13","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/233789240_1074832972921624_9209938198059262599_n.jpeg","description":"Four-panel collage comparing sun's appearance at different times with noble gas discharge spectra. Top left: golden sunrise/sunset over green rolling field with dramatic light rays. Top right: bright white sun in blue sky with puffy white clouds. Center panel: Five noble gas discharge tubes showing emission spectra - He (helium - red/pink glow), Ne (neon - red/orange glow), Ar (argon - purple glow), Kr (krypton - blue/white glow), Xe (xenon - white/purple glow) with chemical symbols labeled above each tube. Bottom left: orange/red sunset over water with dark pier or jetty silhouette. Bottom right: dramatic sunset with vibrant purple and orange clouds. Appears to suggest sun's varying colors throughout day (golden sunrise, white midday, orange/red/purple sunset) could be explained by different gas compositions or local light source rather than atmospheric scattering of distant sunlight. Compares sun's color variations to noble gas discharge tubes to imply similarity in mechanism"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-15","title":"The Sun 15","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/23de4c5fe41ea2554d8d11100b9a0a1d.png","description":"Meme showing dramatic ocean sunset scene with sun rays (crepuscular rays) breaking through thick storm clouds over water. White text at top reads 'THE SUN IS JUST ABOVE THESE CLOUDS IF IT WAS 93 MILLION MILES AWAY' and bottom text states 'THE RAYS WOULD BE COMING THROUGH THE OPEN SPACES TO THE LEFT...END OF STORY!' Argues that visible convergence of sun rays (crepuscular rays) from right side of clouds proves sun is close and local rather than 93 million miles away. Suggests if sun were distant, light rays should appear parallel and illuminate cloud gaps on left side equally. Uses atmospheric optical effect of crepuscular rays converging toward light source as evidence against astronomical distance measurements. Actually demonstrates perspective: parallel light rays from distant sun appear to converge due to perspective, similar to railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
