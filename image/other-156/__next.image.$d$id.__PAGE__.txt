3:T579,Vintage educational map poster from CBS American School of the Air. Decorative beige/cream border with ornate corner designs. Header banner reads 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with subtitle 'AIR MAP OF THE WORLD - A POLAR PROJECTION'. Top corners show two small traditional globe projections. Center features large azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center, showing all continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink/salmon (North America), yellow (Asia), orange (Europe), green (South America, Africa, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. Curved flight paths/routes drawn across map connecting various cities. Outer ring marked with yellow circles indicating time zones or sun positions. Bottom left shows grid reference chart. Bottom center displays vintage CBS microphone illustration. Right side contains lengthy text explaining map's educational purpose and CBS programming details. Bottom text: 'CBS AMERICAN SCHOOL OF THE AIR' with broadcast dates '15th Season October 12, 1945-April 26, 1946'. Historical educational material using azimuthal equidistant projection for radio broadcasting and aviation. Bottom watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Flat Earth proponents cite vintage educational use of this projection as evidence authorities knew Earth's true shape, though projection is standard for polar aviation/radio regardless of Earth's actual shape4:T538,Nikola Tesla quote over vintage scientific illustration collage. Black and white image shows complex technical background with geometric patterns, grid systems, scientific instruments, spiral designs. Left side shows figure (possibly Tesla) working at desk with papers/equipment. Center shows large spiral/coil design. Right side displays vintage electrical equipment, light bulb, measuring devices. White text overlay reads: 'Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. Nikola Tesla'. Bottom right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Quote from famous inventor Nikola Tesla criticizes modern theoretical physics for prioritizing mathematical models over empirical observation and experimentation. Applied to flat Earth context, argues mainstream astronomy relies too heavily on abstract mathematics (gravity calculations, orbital mechanics) rather than direct sensory evidence (Earth appears flat, water is level). Suggests Tesla's experimental approach would support flat Earth over globe model. Uses Tesla's authority as legendary inventor/scientist to legitimize questioning mainstream cosmology. Vintage scientific imagery creates association with classical empiricism versus modern abstraction5:T519,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple-lavender tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Multiple layers of pink-orange clouds create dramatic sky. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to took downwards at the horizon.' [Note: text contains typo 'took' instead of 'look']. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-156","title":"Other 156","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12484610_455543597978713_2113885493044286911_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-155","title":"Other 155","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12473843_454098494789890_4607171506378368323_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-157","title":"Other 157","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12485943_454879928045080_1353300195191586290_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
