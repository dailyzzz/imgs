Left panel shows large white NASA aircraft (modified Boeing 747 with distinctive black nose telescope housing for SOFIA observatory) flying over white clouds and mountain peaks in clear blue sky. Right panel shows interior of aircraft operations center with multiple scientists/technicians seated at workstations with computer monitors and equipment, working under white ceiling panels in cramped quarters. Demonstrates NASA uses airborne observatories and research aircraft equipped with telescopes and imaging equipment for astronomical and Earth observation rather than relying solely on satellites. SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) operates at high altitude to conduct observations typically attributed to space-based telescopes. May be presented as evidence that satellite capabilities can be replicated with aircraft, questioning necessity or existence of orbital satellites."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Satellites 19"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Two-panel comparison showing NASA aircraft-based observation capabilities.
