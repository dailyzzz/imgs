Left panel shows large white NASA aircraft (modified Boeing 747 with distinctive black nose telescope housing for SOFIA observatory) flying over white clouds and mountain peaks in clear blue sky. Right panel shows interior of aircraft operations center with multiple scientists/technicians seated at workstations with computer monitors and equipment, working under white ceiling panels in cramped quarters. Demonstrates NASA uses airborne observatories and research aircraft equipped with telescopes and imaging equipment for astronomical and Earth observation rather than relying solely on satellites. SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) operates at high altitude to conduct observations typically attributed to space-based telescopes. May be presented as evidence that satellite capabilities can be replicated with aircraft, questioning necessity or existence of orbital satellites."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-18","title":"Satellites 18","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/78628044_137442034348225_5099615992837832704_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel satirical meme about satellite imaging. Top panel shows white military-style drone aircraft with 'Google' branding on fuselage, sitting on ground near airfield/runway with buildings in background. Drone has distinctive bulbous nose, long wings, rear propeller, and landing gear. Bottom panel shows Dr. Evil character from Austin Powers movie (bald man in gray suit making air quotes gesture with both hands) with caption text '\"SATELLITE IMAGING\"' in white letters. Meme suggests Google Maps/Earth imagery attributed to satellites is actually captured by high-altitude drones and aircraft rather than orbital satellites, with Dr. Evil air quotes implying 'satellite imaging' is misleading marketing term for conventional aerial photography. Questions whether satellite-based Earth observation exists or if corporations use atmospheric aircraft while claiming satellite technology."},"nextImage":null}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
