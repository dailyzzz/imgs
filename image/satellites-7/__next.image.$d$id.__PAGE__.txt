Top panel shows workers on ship deck working with thick undersea cables, text: 'If the earth is round & we have 1000's of satellites orbiting the earth' with workers wearing hard hats (yellow, white, red) handling large black cables with yellow/gold striping on green deck. Bottom panel shows industrial cable spool machinery on dock or ship, large blue cable reel mounted on frame with cable feeding equipment, text: 'Why do we need over 250 undersea cables spanning continent to continent?' Argues that extensive undersea fiber optic cable infrastructure for global telecommunications contradicts claimed reliance on satellite network, questioning whether satellites are necessary or even exist if physical cables handle communication."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-6","title":"Satellites 6","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37251585_10211375984375241_3268199666755305472_n.jpeg","description":"Meme showing Google image search results for 'satellite in space' with large yellow text overlaid: 'TRYING TO FIND A REAL PHOTO OF SATELLITE IN SPACE' at top and 'CAN'T GET ONE!' at bottom. Search interface shows tabs (ALL, IMAGES, VIDEOS, NEWS, MAPS). Results display 5x5 grid of 25+ satellite images: various CGI renderings and artistic illustrations of satellites with solar panels orbiting Earth, ISS, communications satellites, GPS satellites, all showing polished 3D computer-generated appearance rather than actual photographs. Blue Earth with white clouds visible in many images. Black space backgrounds. Multiple duplicate or similar-looking satellite designs. Suggests all publicly available satellite imagery is computer-generated illustrations rather than authentic space photography, questioning existence or accessibility of real satellite photographs."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-8","title":"Satellites 8","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37272463_10160438871580532_5566116644536713216_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with black background showing white military drone aircraft against clear blue sky. Top text in white: '\"IF SATELLITES EXISTED, YOU WOULDN'T NEED AN AIRPLANE FOR PICTURES.\"' followed by attribution '-DR. JAMES MAC, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE'. Image shows Predator-style unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with distinctive long wings, propeller, landing gear deployed, and 'Google' branding on fuselage. Number '47-3614' visible on side. Suggests military and commercial aerial photography/surveillance is conducted by high-altitude aircraft and drones rather than orbital satellites. Implies Department of Defense source admits satellites unnecessary for reconnaissance imagery when aircraft can perform same function, questioning satellite existence or capability claims."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
