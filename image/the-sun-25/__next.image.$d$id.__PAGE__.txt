3:T401,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Earth's orbital motion. Top panel shows person driving Toyota car from interior view with hands on steering wheel, blurred motion through windshield, dashboard visible. White text reads 'WHEN A CAR SHIFTS IN ACCELERATION YOU FEEL IT'. Bottom panel shows diagram of Earth's elliptical orbit around sun with cyan/blue background. Shows sun (yellow circle) at center with Earth at two positions: 'Aphelion July 4' at 152,500,000 km (94,500,000 mi) on left, and 'Perihelion January 3' at 147,500,000 km (91,500,000 mi) on right. White text asks 'WHY DONT YOU FEEL IT WHEN THE EARTH SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN???' Argues that if Earth accelerates and decelerates during elliptical orbit (moving faster at perihelion, slower at aphelion per Kepler's laws), humans should feel this acceleration like in car. Ignores that orbital changes are extremely gradual over months with negligible acceleration compared to human perception threshold, and that we're in Earth's reference frame moving with it0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-25","title":"The Sun 25","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/35650134_10156713387165288_4790563881523085312_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel image combining sunset photography with sun path diagram. Top four panels show sequence of sunset photographs over ocean from same location, with sun appearing at different positions creating hazy halo effects, coastal vegetation and water visible. Images labeled 'LP' in bottom right of photo grid. Bottom panel shows technical diagram on transparent grid background illustrating sun's apparent path across celestial sphere. Diagram labeled with astronomical terms including 'Vert' (vertical/zenith), 'Antheliv', 'Lowitz arc', '46° halo', 'Parenthely', 'Parhely circle', 'Parhely', 'Obs' (observer), 'Sun', '22° halo'. Shows various optical phenomena and geometric relationships for sun halos and atmospheric optics. Demonstrates how sun's position changes throughout day and various atmospheric optical effects (parhelia/sun dogs, halos, arcs) that can occur. Appears to document actual sun halo observation with corresponding geometric explanation of atmospheric ice crystal refraction phenomena"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-24","title":"The Sun 24","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/34014529_1675055982531498_937858752495747072_o.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-26","title":"The Sun 26","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36686740_266223047266545_5058305824858832896_n.jpeg","description":"Serene sunset photograph over calm ocean showing sun touching horizon. Bright golden-yellow sun sits precisely at waterline creating perfect vertical reflection path across still water surface. Sky displays subtle gradient from gray-blue at top through peachy-beige to golden-orange near horizon with light hazy atmospheric scattering. Ocean water appears smooth and dark blue-gray with golden sun reflection stretching from horizon toward viewer as bright vertical column with rippled texture. Small waves or foam visible at bottom edge of frame on shoreline. Peaceful, minimalist composition with horizontal layers of color. Classic sunset scene demonstrating sun's position at horizon during day-night transition, often used in discussions about whether sun sets below horizon (indicating spherical Earth) or simply moves away via perspective (flat Earth model). Image shows sun appearing to meet horizon line suggesting geometric sunset"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
