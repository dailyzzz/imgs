Top four panels show sequence of sunset photographs over ocean from same location, with sun appearing at different positions creating hazy halo effects, coastal vegetation and water visible. Images labeled 'LP' in bottom right of photo grid. Bottom panel shows technical diagram on transparent grid background illustrating sun's apparent path across celestial sphere. Diagram labeled with astronomical terms including 'Vert' (vertical/zenith), 'Antheliv', 'Lowitz arc', '46° halo', 'Parenthely', 'Parhely circle', 'Parhely', 'Obs' (observer), 'Sun', '22° halo'. Shows various optical phenomena and geometric relationships for sun halos and atmospheric optics. Demonstrates how sun's position changes throughout day and various atmospheric optical effects (parhelia/sun dogs, halos, arcs) that can occur. Appears to document actual sun halo observation with corresponding geometric explanation of atmospheric ice crystal refraction phenomena"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Sun 25"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Multi-panel image combining sunset photography with sun path diagram.
