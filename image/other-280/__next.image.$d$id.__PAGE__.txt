3:T811,Artistic eye crying Earth teardrop about belief versus evidence. Digitally manipulated artistic photograph with philosophical message about cognitive bias. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence,'. Image shows close-up of human eye - most of image in black and white/grayscale showing detailed eye with long dark eyelashes, visible eye texture, wrinkled eyelid. Eye itself digitally enhanced with vivid colors: iris shows striking emerald green with teal-blue inner ring, both featuring radial pattern emanating from dark black pupil. White sclera bright and clear. Small white catchlight reflection in upper iris suggests light source. From lower eyelid, single large teardrop falls - this teardrop digitally composited to show spherical globe Earth. Teardrop displays photorealistic Earth image showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (visible: Asia, Australia, Africa, South America), white cloud formations, appearing as miniature planet encased in water droplet. Light refracts through teardrop creating slight distortion. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text continues quote: 'it's based on a deep seated need to believe.' Quote describes confirmation bias and emotional investment in beliefs independent of evidence. In flat Earth context, ironically accuses globe Earth believers of emotional attachment rather than rational assessment. Suggests people believe spherical Earth due to psychological need for mainstream acceptance, not evidence evaluation. However, this same criticism applies to flat Earth belief - often rooted in distrust of authority, desire to feel special knowledge, religious conviction, conspiracy mindset rather than objective evidence examination. Psychological projection - attributing one's own traits to others. Spherical Earth supported by overwhelming evidence anyone can verify. Crying Earth symbolizes sadness at being rejected despite evidence. Artistic metaphor for gap between evidence and belief4:T87c,CGI visualization of gravitational waves from binary black hole merger. Computer-generated scientific illustration showing spacetime curvature from gravitational wave detection. Image displays 3D rendered visualization of Einstein's general relativity prediction. Dark blue-gray curved grid represents fabric of spacetime shown as flexible surface with coordinate grid lines. Grid dramatically warped into spiral depression forming funnel shape leading to center. Two small black circular objects (black holes) visible at center of deepest depression representing binary black hole system spiraling together. Concentric circular ripples emanate outward from center showing gravitational waves propagating through spacetime as massive objects accelerate. Waves create undulating wave pattern in grid surface - amplitude decreases with distance from source. Perspective view from slightly elevated angle looking into depression. Lighting creates shadowed contours emphasizing depth and curvature. Lower portion shows large cyan/light blue text: 'CGI PROVES GRAVITY WAVES ARE REAL.' Below in smaller text: 'BECAUSE 'SCIENTISTS' SAID SO.' Visualization based on LIGO's September 2015 detection of gravitational waves from two merging black holes 1.3 billion light-years away. This was groundbreaking confirmation of Einstein's 1915 prediction, earning 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth meme mocks reliance on computer visualization rather than direct observation. Skeptics argue CGI isn't proof - just artistic interpretation of data. However, visualization illustrates real signal detected by LIGO interferometers which measured spacetime distortion of 1/10,000th proton diameter - requiring extraordinary precision. Multiple detections since 2015 from independent observatories confirm phenomenon. CGI helps visualize abstract concept but actual evidence is interferometer data, mathematical models, predictions matching observations. Visualization is educational tool, not proof itself. Similar to how medical illustrations show blood flow - real phenomenon, illustrated for comprehension. Gravitational waves require general relativity which flat Earth models reject5:T832,Ken Jeong angry teacher meme about flat Earth researchers. Popular meme format using actor Ken Jeong's character Mr. Chow or similar role showing exaggerated frustration. Image shows Asian man (appears to be Ken Jeong) in classroom setting wearing maroon/burgundy shirt. He has intense angry expression with eyes squinted shut, mouth open yelling, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. Right hand raised to side of head holding small white piece of paper or note in pinched fingers. Expression suggests extreme exasperation or rage. Background shows blurred green chalkboard/blackboard suggesting classroom or teaching environment. Body language indicates theatrical overreaction to something said. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO RESEARCH FLAT EARTH'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text: 'BEFORE THEY GET UPSET AND START TELLING ME I'M WRONG'. Meme format typically used for 'Here's a list of people who...' jokes where list is very short (single small paper) or nonexistent. In this context, suggests flat Earthers get immediately defensive when their beliefs challenged, refusing to accept contrary evidence. Implies flat Earth believers haven't actually researched topic before committing to belief - they became emotionally invested first, then get angry when contradicted rather than examining evidence objectively. Common criticism of conspiracy theorists: strong emotional reactions to challenges rather than calm logical discourse. However, many flat Earthers claim extensive research led them to conclusion - countless YouTube videos, forums, books, experiments (though often flawed methodology or confirmation bias). Meme captures frustration of debunkers who present evidence (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, time zones, seasons, circumnavigation, satellite communications) only to face angry dismissal rather than rational discussion. Ken Jeong's over-the-top expression amplifies comedic effect suggesting disproportionate emotional response to simple facts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-280","title":"Other 280","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729160_463934640472942_5933021468034405396_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-279","title":"Other 279","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12728936_463973683802371_1333794006432160460_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-281","title":"Other 281","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729190_465943886938684_6995591824522989875_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
