5:T811,Artistic eye crying Earth teardrop about belief versus evidence. Digitally manipulated artistic photograph with philosophical message about cognitive bias. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence,'. Image shows close-up of human eye - most of image in black and white/grayscale showing detailed eye with long dark eyelashes, visible eye texture, wrinkled eyelid. Eye itself digitally enhanced with vivid colors: iris shows striking emerald green with teal-blue inner ring, both featuring radial pattern emanating from dark black pupil. White sclera bright and clear. Small white catchlight reflection in upper iris suggests light source. From lower eyelid, single large teardrop falls - this teardrop digitally composited to show spherical globe Earth. Teardrop displays photorealistic Earth image showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (visible: Asia, Australia, Africa, South America), white cloud formations, appearing as miniature planet encased in water droplet. Light refracts through teardrop creating slight distortion. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text continues quote: 'it's based on a deep seated need to believe.' Quote describes confirmation bias and emotional investment in beliefs independent of evidence. In flat Earth context, ironically accuses globe Earth believers of emotional attachment rather than rational assessment. Suggests people believe spherical Earth due to psychological need for mainstream acceptance, not evidence evaluation. However, this same criticism applies to flat Earth belief - often rooted in distrust of authority, desire to feel special knowledge, religious conviction, conspiracy mindset rather than objective evidence examination. Psychological projection - attributing one's own traits to others. Spherical Earth supported by overwhelming evidence anyone can verify. Crying Earth symbolizes sadness at being rejected despite evidence. Artistic metaphor for gap between evidence and belief0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 280 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Artistic eye crying Earth teardrop about belief versus evidence.
