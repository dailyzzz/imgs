3:T485,Chuck Norris action hero meme rejecting gravity. Shows iconic 1980s/90s photograph of Chuck Norris in classic action hero pose. Norris wears sleeveless light blue denim shirt with chest exposed, brown hair and beard. Holds two large black handguns (possibly Uzis or MAC-10s) pointed in opposite directions with dramatic tough-guy stance. Smoky dark background creates action movie atmosphere. White speech bubble at top left: 'suck it, gravity'. Bottom text in white: 'Next time you hear someone use "gravity" as an excuse for some global miracle, switch it to Chuck Norris. It will still be a joke, but at least Chuck Norris exists.' Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Uses Chuck Norris Facts meme format (hyperbolic jokes about Norris defying physics/logic) to mock gravity as explanation for Earth's phenomena. Argues gravity is unproven theoretical force like fictional Chuck Norris superpowers. Suggests replacing gravity with Chuck Norris in scientific explanations makes equal sense because neither can be directly observed. Implies gravity is convenient magical explanation for how globe Earth functions, no more real than action hero mythology4:T553,Illuminati card game parody featuring Flat Earthers. Shows trading card with black border and red textured background with yellow triangular Illuminati eye symbols. Center displays illustration of flat rectangular Earth floating in black starry space. Earth shown as blue oceans with green/brown continents (Africa, Asia, Americas visible) on flat platform/slab. Small rocket or spacecraft visible below Earth. Top text in pink/salmon color: 'Flat Earthers'. Below image, pink text box contains game rules: 'People laugh, but the flat Earthers know something. For their action, you may roll 2 dice. If your roll is equal to or less than the number of Places you control, the Flat Earthers' weird alternate geology has led them to a gold strike, and you may draw as many Plot cards as the number you rolled.' Bottom shows game stats: 'POWER 1' on left, 'RESISTANCE 2' on right. Bottom labels: 'Weird, Conservative' in yellow text. Black border frames entire card. Satirical parody of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: New World Order conspiracy-themed card game. Card treats flat Earth belief as fringe conspiracy theory alongside other game's satirical secret societies. Game mechanics suggest flat Earthers are weird outsiders who occasionally stumble onto truth (gold strike) despite being laughed at. Conservative label associates flat Earth with right-wing politics5:T4ab,Freemason 666 numerology meme connecting Earth measurements. Dark red gradient background with black water reflection effect. Top banner in distressed red text: 'FREEMASON SCIENCE'. White text states: 'Earth revolves around the sun at:' followed by large yellow numbers '66,600 mph'. Next line: 'Curvature of one square mile:' with yellow numbers '.666 ft.' with small degree symbol. Bottom section shows 'Earth tilts at:' with large yellow '66.6°'. Right side displays CGI globe Earth partially submerged in dark red water showing Africa, Europe, Mediterranean visible in green/tan/blue. Bottom text in distressed red: 'STILL THINK IT'S ALL A COINCIDENCE?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in bottom right. Conspiracy theory connects repeating 666 pattern (number of the beast from Revelation) in Earth's orbital speed, curvature calculation, and axial tilt. Implies Freemasons designed heliocentric model using occult numerology rather than empirical measurements. Argues these suspiciously similar numbers prove globe Earth is Satanic deception. Uses apocalyptic imagery (blood-red sky/water, sinking Earth) to create ominous atmosphere. Suggests mainstream astronomy encodes hidden occult knowledge0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-175","title":"Other 175","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512370_480994238766982_5452094373629189205_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-174","title":"Other 174","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12510469_456893894510350_2372706113580209074_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-176","title":"Other 176","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512420_483466411853098_1470728874970540080_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
