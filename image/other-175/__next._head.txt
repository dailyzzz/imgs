5:T485,Chuck Norris action hero meme rejecting gravity. Shows iconic 1980s/90s photograph of Chuck Norris in classic action hero pose. Norris wears sleeveless light blue denim shirt with chest exposed, brown hair and beard. Holds two large black handguns (possibly Uzis or MAC-10s) pointed in opposite directions with dramatic tough-guy stance. Smoky dark background creates action movie atmosphere. White speech bubble at top left: 'suck it, gravity'. Bottom text in white: 'Next time you hear someone use "gravity" as an excuse for some global miracle, switch it to Chuck Norris. It will still be a joke, but at least Chuck Norris exists.' Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Uses Chuck Norris Facts meme format (hyperbolic jokes about Norris defying physics/logic) to mock gravity as explanation for Earth's phenomena. Argues gravity is unproven theoretical force like fictional Chuck Norris superpowers. Suggests replacing gravity with Chuck Norris in scientific explanations makes equal sense because neither can be directly observed. Implies gravity is convenient magical explanation for how globe Earth functions, no more real than action hero mythology0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 175 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Chuck Norris action hero meme rejecting gravity.
