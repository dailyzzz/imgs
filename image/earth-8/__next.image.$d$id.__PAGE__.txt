3:T544,Historical quote image featuring portrait of Martin Luther (1483-1546), Protestant Reformation leader wearing black cap and robes against yellow-green background. Black text box contains quote: "There is talk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that the earth moves and goes around instead of the sky, the sun, the moon, just as if somebody were moving in a carriage or ship might hold that he was sitting still and at rest while the earth and the trees walked and moved. But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must needs invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth." – Martin Luther (in response to the publication of the brief Commentariolus, which appeared a decade before De Revolutionibus. This comes from Luther's Tablebook, "Tischreden," or record of dinner-table conversations)'. Website: 'www.philipstallings.com'. Historical quote shows Protestant Reformation leader condemned heliocentric Copernican model as foolish contradiction of biblical literalism, specifically Joshua 10:12-13 where sun stopped moving rather than Earth ceasing rotation. Used to demonstrate religious authority opposition to heliocentrism4:T457,Historical newspaper page from 'The Pacific Commercial Advertiser (Honolulu)' dated February 9, 1905.
