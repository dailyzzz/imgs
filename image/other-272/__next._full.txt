13:T848,Flat Earth analemma diagram showing sun's annual path with seasons. Educational cosmological diagram illustrating sun's movement through calendar year in flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows analemma pattern - figure-8 or infinity symbol path traced by sun's position throughout year. Path formed by 24 yellow-cream circular dots representing sun positions at different dates, each dot same size. Pattern displays two loops - upper loop wider than lower loop, connected at center creating characteristic analemma shape. Month labels positioned around pattern in clockwise order starting from top: DECEMBER at top center (winter), JANUARY upper right, FEBRUARY middle right, MARCH lower right, APRIL bottom center, MAY lower left, JUNE bottom center, JULY middle right of lower loop, AUGUST lower right, SEPTEMBER middle left, OCTOBER upper left, NOVEMBER upper middle left, returning to DECEMBER. Two curved bracket symbols drawn within loops suggesting sun's circular/elliptical paths. Four season labels in corners: AUTUMN (upper left, orange text), WINTER (upper right, light blue text), SPRING (lower left, green text), SUMMER (lower right, white text). Bottom subtitle on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Beige border frames entire diagram with vintage aesthetic. Analemma is figure-8 pattern traced by sun's position in sky when photographed from same location at same time each day over year. In reality, analemma results from Earth's axial tilt (23.5°) combined with elliptical orbit causing slight variations in solar noon timing. On spherical Earth, analemma demonstrates planet's orbital mechanics. Flat Earth models struggle to explain analemma formation since their proposed sun movements (circular path above disc) wouldn't produce this pattern. This diagram attempts to show sun following figure-8 path above flat Earth, but provides no mechanism for why sun would trace this specific path or how it creates seasons. Scientific analemma photography consistently shows pattern proving Earth's tilt and elliptical orbit14:T855,Kyle meme collage about Earth shape apathy versus passionate truth-seekers. Complex multi-panel meme using 'Disappointed/Disgusted Kyle' template featuring numerous repeated images of same bald character. Background collage contains approximately 40+ instances of similar-looking bald male face in various situations - eating burgers, holding drinks (Starbucks cups visible), ice cream cones, phones, looking disgusted or disappointed. Some panels show magazine covers or advertisements. Character appears to be stock photo model used repeatedly across different scenarios. Images arranged in chaotic overlapping grid pattern filling entire frame. Top text in white with black outline: 'WHO CARES IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT COLD, HARD HOLLOW STARE OF THOSE THAT SIMPLY DON'T CARE'. Lower right corner shows red 'DOUBLE GLP' text and 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme contrasts two mindsets: apathetic mainstream person who doesn't question Earth's shape versus passionate truth-seeker who cares deeply about cosmological reality. 'Kyle' character represents stereotypical millennial consumer - bald, somewhat bland expression, frequently shown with consumer products (fast food, coffee, snacks). Repeated imagery creates unsettling effect suggesting mindless conformity and vacant disinterest. Flat Earth community uses this format to criticize what they perceive as intellectual laziness - people who accept conventional wisdom without investigation. Implies those who don't care about Earth's shape are empty, shallow, distracted by consumerism and trivial concerns. By contrast, flat Earthers position themselves as engaged critical thinkers pursuing truth regardless of social consequences. 'Cold, hard hollow stare' describes perceived vacancy in eyes of those who never questioned globe Earth model. However, most people accept spherical Earth based on abundant evidence rather than apathy - curvature visible from altitude, ships disappearing over horizon, circumnavigation, satellite communications, seasons, time zones, Foucault pendulum, stellar parallax, etc.15:T84d,Toy Story Buzz Lightyear gravitational waves detection meme. Popular internet meme format using characters from Pixar's Toy Story animated film franchise. Image shows Woody (left) and Buzz Lightyear (right) standing together. Woody is cowboy doll wearing brown cow-print vest, yellow shirt, blue jeans, red bandana, brown cowboy hat with sheriff badge. He has concerned skeptical expression with raised eyebrow looking at Buzz. Buzz Lightyear is space ranger action figure wearing white and green futuristic space suit with purple and red accents, purple hood/helmet, colorful control buttons on chest. Buzz stands with arms outstretched in his characteristic heroic pose pointing upward and outward with confident enthusiastic expression. Background shows blurred tan/beige desert landscape suggesting outdoor scene from film. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Bottom text in same style: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES EVERYWHERE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme references Buzz's famous line from Toy Story: 'X, X everywhere!' format (originally 'Lasers, lasers everywhere!' or fan-made 'X, X everywhere' variants). Format used to describe something that's suddenly everywhere or being over-applied. In this context, mocking 2016 announcement of gravitational waves detection by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's General Relativity, first directly detected September 2015 from merging black holes. Discovery won 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth community skeptical of gravitational waves since they: 1) require spacetime to exist (flat Earth models reject relativity), 2) confirm predictions of Einstein's gravity theory which flat Earthers dismiss, 3) detected by sophisticated instruments flat Earthers distrust. Meme suggests scientists invoke gravitational waves too frequently as explanation or that concept is being overused in media. However, gravitational wave astronomy is legitimate field with multiple confirmed detections opening new way to observe universe9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-272","title":"Other 272","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717648_464902217042851_3090432165187052994_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-271","title":"Other 271","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717576_463022067230866_8640594122558677966_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-273","title":"Other 273","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717709_463444777188595_8211548813359873487_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
