5:T848,Flat Earth analemma diagram showing sun's annual path with seasons. Educational cosmological diagram illustrating sun's movement through calendar year in flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows analemma pattern - figure-8 or infinity symbol path traced by sun's position throughout year. Path formed by 24 yellow-cream circular dots representing sun positions at different dates, each dot same size. Pattern displays two loops - upper loop wider than lower loop, connected at center creating characteristic analemma shape. Month labels positioned around pattern in clockwise order starting from top: DECEMBER at top center (winter), JANUARY upper right, FEBRUARY middle right, MARCH lower right, APRIL bottom center, MAY lower left, JUNE bottom center, JULY middle right of lower loop, AUGUST lower right, SEPTEMBER middle left, OCTOBER upper left, NOVEMBER upper middle left, returning to DECEMBER. Two curved bracket symbols drawn within loops suggesting sun's circular/elliptical paths. Four season labels in corners: AUTUMN (upper left, orange text), WINTER (upper right, light blue text), SPRING (lower left, green text), SUMMER (lower right, white text). Bottom subtitle on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Beige border frames entire diagram with vintage aesthetic. Analemma is figure-8 pattern traced by sun's position in sky when photographed from same location at same time each day over year. In reality, analemma results from Earth's axial tilt (23.5°) combined with elliptical orbit causing slight variations in solar noon timing. On spherical Earth, analemma demonstrates planet's orbital mechanics. Flat Earth models struggle to explain analemma formation since their proposed sun movements (circular path above disc) wouldn't produce this pattern. This diagram attempts to show sun following figure-8 path above flat Earth, but provides no mechanism for why sun would trace this specific path or how it creates seasons. Scientific analemma photography consistently shows pattern proving Earth's tilt and elliptical orbit0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 272 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth analemma diagram showing sun's annual path with seasons.
