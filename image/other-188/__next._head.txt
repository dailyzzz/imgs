5:T47b,Jackie Chan confused meme questioning measurable curvature. Shows action star Jackie Chan in gray knit sweater with white collar visible. Both hands pressed against sides of head in classic confused/mind-blown gesture. Dark black hair slightly messy. Facial expression shows bewilderment - eyes squinting, mouth slightly open, eyebrows furrowed. Blurred gray background suggests indoor setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'CURVED EARTH'. Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN'T MEASURE CURVATURE? WHAT?' Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses popular Jackie Chan confusion meme format to express logical contradiction. Argues if Earth is truly curved sphere, curvature should be measurable through surveying, laser tests, or visual observation at distance. Points out that despite claims of 8 inches per mile squared curvature formula, real-world measurements consistently show flat/level surfaces over long distances (bridges, canals, railways, etc.). Jackie Chan's exaggerated confusion represents flat Earth believers' frustration with lack of empirical curvature evidence despite scientific claims0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 188 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Jackie Chan confused meme questioning measurable curvature.
