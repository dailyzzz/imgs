5:Tbd4,NASA logo tattoo photograph with humorous mock regret message. Photograph showing person's leg with permanent NASA tattoo accompanied by text mocking their decision. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY JUST REMEMBER'. Central image shows close-up of person's lower leg/calf area. Person wears dark gray or black pants rolled up to mid-calf, green sock pulled down to ankle, and black sneaker. Skin visible on calf shows large tattoo of NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circular background with red chevron wing, white 'NASA' text, white stars, and orbital trajectory line. Tattoo appears professionally done with clean lines and solid colors, approximately 4-5 inches diameter covering significant portion of calf. Colors vibrant and distinct - deep blue background, bright red chevron, clean white elements. Tattoo relatively new based on sharp appearance without fading. Background shows indoor setting with beige/tan speckled floor (appears to be commercial flooring like restaurant, office, or public building) and dark wooden furniture leg visible on left. Lighting suggests indoor fluorescent or LED illumination. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'YOU COULD BE THIS GUY'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme mocks person who got permanent NASA tattoo, suggesting they'll regret decision once they 'learn the truth' about space agency. Flat Earth community views NASA as primary organization perpetuating globe Earth 'lie' through fake space missions, CGI images, propaganda. Implies person blindly trusted NASA enough to permanently ink logo on body but will eventually discover agency is fraudulent, leaving them with embarrassing permanent reminder of their 'gullibility'. Humor derives from imagined future regret - being stuck with NASA tattoo after becoming flat Earth believer would create awkward situation. Would require expensive laser removal, cover-up tattoo, or living with constant reminder of former beliefs. Format of 'having a bad day? at least you're not this guy' is common meme template for schadenfreude - taking comfort in others' misfortunes or poor decisions. However, NASA has successfully executed numerous space missions over 60+ years providing satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting, Earth observation, planetary exploration, International Space Station operations. Thousands of photos, livestreams, returned samples, astronaut testimony from multiple nations all confirm space agency's accomplishments. Person with NASA tattoo likely space enthusiast, employee, or someone inspired by scientific achievement. From mainstream perspective, NASA tattoo represents admiration for human achievement, scientific progress, space exploration - nothing to regret. Only within flat Earth worldview does tattoo become embarrassing. Meme reveals flat Earth community's certainty that their beliefs are correct and others will eventually recognize it, experiencing regret for supporting mainstream science0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 328 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"NASA logo tattoo photograph with humorous mock regret message.
