3:Tbd4,NASA logo tattoo photograph with humorous mock regret message. Photograph showing person's leg with permanent NASA tattoo accompanied by text mocking their decision. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'IF YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY JUST REMEMBER'. Central image shows close-up of person's lower leg/calf area. Person wears dark gray or black pants rolled up to mid-calf, green sock pulled down to ankle, and black sneaker. Skin visible on calf shows large tattoo of NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circular background with red chevron wing, white 'NASA' text, white stars, and orbital trajectory line. Tattoo appears professionally done with clean lines and solid colors, approximately 4-5 inches diameter covering significant portion of calf. Colors vibrant and distinct - deep blue background, bright red chevron, clean white elements. Tattoo relatively new based on sharp appearance without fading. Background shows indoor setting with beige/tan speckled floor (appears to be commercial flooring like restaurant, office, or public building) and dark wooden furniture leg visible on left. Lighting suggests indoor fluorescent or LED illumination. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'YOU COULD BE THIS GUY'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme mocks person who got permanent NASA tattoo, suggesting they'll regret decision once they 'learn the truth' about space agency. Flat Earth community views NASA as primary organization perpetuating globe Earth 'lie' through fake space missions, CGI images, propaganda. Implies person blindly trusted NASA enough to permanently ink logo on body but will eventually discover agency is fraudulent, leaving them with embarrassing permanent reminder of their 'gullibility'. Humor derives from imagined future regret - being stuck with NASA tattoo after becoming flat Earth believer would create awkward situation. Would require expensive laser removal, cover-up tattoo, or living with constant reminder of former beliefs. Format of 'having a bad day? at least you're not this guy' is common meme template for schadenfreude - taking comfort in others' misfortunes or poor decisions. However, NASA has successfully executed numerous space missions over 60+ years providing satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting, Earth observation, planetary exploration, International Space Station operations. Thousands of photos, livestreams, returned samples, astronaut testimony from multiple nations all confirm space agency's accomplishments. Person with NASA tattoo likely space enthusiast, employee, or someone inspired by scientific achievement. From mainstream perspective, NASA tattoo represents admiration for human achievement, scientific progress, space exploration - nothing to regret. Only within flat Earth worldview does tattoo become embarrassing. Meme reveals flat Earth community's certainty that their beliefs are correct and others will eventually recognize it, experiencing regret for supporting mainstream science4:Ta9f,Facebook notification meme showing social media activity explosion after discovering flat Earth. Humorous meme depicting dramatic increase in Facebook notifications after becoming flat Earth believer. Blue Facebook-themed background mimics social media interface. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'BEFORE DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Upper section shows Facebook interface elements in darker blue silhouette style: left shows two-person icon (friends/people), center shows speech bubble icon (messages), right shows globe/world icon (notifications) with small red notification badge showing number '7' suggesting minimal activity. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'AFTER DISCOVERING FLAT EARTH'. Lower section shows same three Facebook icons but with dramatically increased notification numbers in bright orange-red badges: friends icon shows '419', messages icon shows '91', globe/notifications icon shows '134' - representing exponential increase in social media engagement. Meme humorously captures experience of flat Earth believers who become extremely active in online debates and discussions. After discovering flat Earth theory, person presumably begins posting about it frequently, leading to flood of responses from friends, family, and strangers. High notification counts suggest: 1) Friend requests or tags from other flat Earthers (419), 2) Direct messages from people debating or questioning beliefs (91), 3) Post notifications from intense comment threads (134). Meme resonates because flat Earth believers often report becoming consumed by topic, spending hours in online debates, watching conspiracy videos, joining Facebook groups, commenting on mainstream science posts. Controversial beliefs naturally generate engagement - mix of fellow believers providing encouragement and skeptics offering counterarguments. Many report losing friendships or facing social consequences but finding new community among fellow believers. Humorous tone suggests self-awareness about obsessive engagement. Format reflects reality that conspiracy theory beliefs often accompanied by intense online activity - researching 'evidence', sharing memes, debating critics, seeking validation from like-minded individuals. Social media algorithms may amplify this by showing more flat Earth content once user engages with it, creating echo chamber effect. Psychology research shows conspiracy theory believers often form tight-knit online communities where shared marginalized beliefs create strong social bonds. Meme functions as both self-deprecating humor and implicit brag about dedication to 'truth-seeking' despite social pushback5:T927,Motivational meme showing mountain climber silhouette standing atop rocky mountain peak with dramatic cloud layer below and blue sky above. Text at top reads "THOSE WHO HAVE EYES DO NOT BELIEVE THE EARTH IS FLAT" and bottom text states "THEY SEE IT". Image presents classic flat Earth argument that from high altitudes (mountains, airplanes), observers can see horizon appears flat rather than curved, suggesting this visual evidence contradicts spherical Earth model. Stunning landscape photograph features lone hiker positioned on snowy/rocky summit with sea of white clouds stretching to horizon below, bright sun creating lens flare in upper portion of frame, creating dramatic perspective that emphasizes vast horizontal plane of cloud layer. Argument relies on limited human perspective and scale - Earth's curvature becomes visible only at much higher altitudes (typically above 35,000 feet or from spacecraft), and from mountaintop elevations (even 20,000+ feet), curvature is extremely subtle due to Earth's large size (7,917 mile diameter means curvature drops only about 8 inches per mile squared). What observers interpret as "flat" horizon is actually limitation of human visual system combined with atmospheric effects and fact that from any ground-based vantage point, observer is viewing tiny fraction of Earth's total surface. Commercial airline passengers at cruising altitude (35,000-40,000 feet) can observe slight curvature when looking at horizon, though effect is subtle. High-altitude balloon footage and images from International Space Station clearly show Earth's curvature. Meme employs "seeing is believing" rhetoric to suggest direct observation trumps scientific measurements and calculations, but fails to account for limitations of human perception at planetary scales. Cloud layer in image creates particularly deceptive effect, as uniform horizontal plane of clouds reinforces impression of flatness, even though clouds themselves follow Earth's curvature. Scientific rebuttal: Earth's radius is approximately 3,959 miles; from typical mountain summit (10,000-15,000 feet altitude), horizon distance extends only 120-150 miles, representing less than 0.5% of Earth's circumference - far too small a sample to visually detect overall curvature.
