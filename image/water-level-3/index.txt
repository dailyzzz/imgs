White text at top reads 'EASIEST FLAT EARTH PROOF' and large bottom text states 'WATAAAAH' in dramatic lettering. References Bruce Lee's famous philosophy 'Be like water' and his iconic vocal expression during martial arts demonstrations. Meme uses water as simplest proof of flat Earth: water naturally seeks and maintains level surface due to gravity, always finding lowest point and creating flat, horizontal surface when undisturbed. Argues this observable property of water (always level, never curved) proves Earth must be flat plane rather than sphere. Combines Bruce Lee's water philosophy with flat Earth argument that water's tendency to be level contradicts curved ocean surfaces required by spherical Earth model. Humorous format using martial arts legend to present water level as definitive flat Earth evidence"}}]
