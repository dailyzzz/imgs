Shows pristine white sandy beach in foreground with single coconut palm tree leaning at angle over turquoise-blue ocean water. Palm fronds extend gracefully toward right side. Ocean displays gradient from light turquoise near shore to deeper blue at horizon. Clear bright blue sky with white puffy clouds scattered across upper portion. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across entire width of image. Sandy beach shows footprints and natural beach debris. Bottom watermark 'FlatEarth101.com' in green text. Image emphasizes perfectly level, flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, used to demonstrate observable flatness of water surface and question spherical Earth model. Tropical paradise setting provides unobstructed view of distant horizon over calm waters"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-2","title":"Water Level 2","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/12321575_10207376173895558_9199750304057680573_n.jpeg","description":"Photograph of Verrazano-Narrows Bridge spanning water with cargo ships passing beneath. Top text states 'the Verrazano-Narrows bridge is 13700 feet long' and 'the curvature of the earth was taken into account when designing the bridge'. Red horizontal line drawn across water surface. Large red arrow points downward to water with text 'the water is supposed to curve with the bridge' followed by smaller text 'maybe there was an issue with gravity when this photo was made'. Questions why water appears flat/level beneath long bridge if Earth's curvature was considered in bridge design, suggesting water should visibly curve if Earth is spherical"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-4","title":"Water Level 4","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14906983_1473512396010956_8187552407344125710_n.jpeg","description":"Bruce Lee meme with black background featuring martial artist in iconic fighting stance with intense expression, shirtless showing muscular physique, hands extended in defensive/attack position. White text at top reads 'EASIEST FLAT EARTH PROOF' and large bottom text states 'WATAAAAH' in dramatic lettering. References Bruce Lee's famous philosophy 'Be like water' and his iconic vocal expression during martial arts demonstrations. Meme uses water as simplest proof of flat Earth: water naturally seeks and maintains level surface due to gravity, always finding lowest point and creating flat, horizontal surface when undisturbed. Argues this observable property of water (always level, never curved) proves Earth must be flat plane rather than sphere. Combines Bruce Lee's water philosophy with flat Earth argument that water's tendency to be level contradicts curved ocean surfaces required by spherical Earth model. Humorous format using martial arts legend to present water level as definitive flat Earth evidence"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
