Bottom panel labeled 'Science on the globe' shows hands using calculator with person wearing glasses looking at camera, calculator display visible showing numbers. Green banner for flat Earth, blue banner for globe. Bottom red banner shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' watermark. Satirical comparison suggesting flat Earth science involves rigorous experimental work while globe Earth science relies solely on mathematical calculations without empirical testing. Implies mainstream science uses abstract math rather than observable experiments, while flat Earth proponents conduct hands-on research"}}]
