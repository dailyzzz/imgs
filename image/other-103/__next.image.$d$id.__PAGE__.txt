Header 'CREPUSCULAR RAYS' in white bold letters. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene over calm ocean with military ships silhouetted on horizon. Multiple distinct light beams (crepuscular rays) radiate downward from gaps in dark gray storm clouds, creating spectacular fan pattern. Rays appear to converge toward light source behind clouds. Golden-orange sunlight illuminates water surface. Dark hills/land visible on right horizon. Green vegetation silhouette in foreground. Bottom text states 'TELL US THE SUN IS CLOSE' in white letters. Presents crepuscular rays as evidence for nearby local sun rather than distant 93-million-mile sun. Argues visible convergence of light rays demonstrates perspective effect from close light source, similar to how railroad tracks appear to converge. Questions how parallel rays from distant sun would create such obvious convergence pattern"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-102","title":"Other 102","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10171854_472049099661496_4972284746669759681_n.jpg","description":"Goodfellas laughing meme from iconic movie scene. Top text: 'THAT MOMENT WHEN'. Shows Ray Liotta (Henry Hill) in white tuxedo bow tie laughing hysterically with mouth wide open, head tilted back. Another man in dark suit visible in background also laughing in elegant restaurant/dining setting with warm lighting and curtains. Bottom text: 'SOMEONE TELLS YOU NASA WENT TO THE MOON'. Watermark 'fb.com/fematters' in bottom left. Classic meme format expressing incredulous disbelief, suggesting moon landing claims are laughably absurd. Uses dramatic laughter scene to convey reaction to supposed impossibility of NASA moon missions. Implies moon landings are obvious hoax that anyone informed would find ridiculous.

Top panel labeled 'Science on the Flat earth' shows two scientists in white lab coats and safety goggles conducting laboratory experiment with glassware containing colorful liquids (beaker with purple liquid, test tube with orange liquid), microscope visible in background, professional laboratory setting. Bottom panel labeled 'Science on the globe' shows hands using calculator with person wearing glasses looking at camera, calculator display visible showing numbers. Green banner for flat Earth, blue banner for globe. Bottom red banner shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' watermark. Satirical comparison suggesting flat Earth science involves rigorous experimental work while globe Earth science relies solely on mathematical calculations without empirical testing. Implies mainstream science uses abstract math rather than observable experiments, while flat Earth proponents conduct hands-on research"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
