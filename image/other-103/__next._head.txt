Header 'CREPUSCULAR RAYS' in white bold letters. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene over calm ocean with military ships silhouetted on horizon. Multiple distinct light beams (crepuscular rays) radiate downward from gaps in dark gray storm clouds, creating spectacular fan pattern. Rays appear to converge toward light source behind clouds. Golden-orange sunlight illuminates water surface. Dark hills/land visible on right horizon. Green vegetation silhouette in foreground. Bottom text states 'TELL US THE SUN IS CLOSE' in white letters. Presents crepuscular rays as evidence for nearby local sun rather than distant 93-million-mile sun. Argues visible convergence of light rays demonstrates perspective effect from close light source, similar to how railroad tracks appear to converge. Questions how parallel rays from distant sun would create such obvious convergence pattern"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Other 103"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Atmospheric photograph of crepuscular rays over water with educational text.
