Left shows red brick house with observers at ground level (purple horizontal line represents ground/eye level). Yellow circles represent sun positions along two paths: top horizontal blue line shows sun's actual level path parallel to ground, bottom diagonal blue line shows sun's apparent visual path descending toward horizon due to perspective. Multiple human figures shown walking on sloped brown ground plane between houses of decreasing size. Gray lines from distant sun positions show light rays reaching observer. Red text label 'Atmospheric Lensing' with blue curved arrow indicates atmospheric refraction effect bending light near horizon. Demonstrates how sun traveling horizontally appears to descend and set due to perspective convergence and atmospheric lensing, without requiring curved Earth."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Perspective 20"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Detailed educational diagram titled 'PERSPECTIVE (SIDE VIEW)' in red text showing sun's apparent movement over flat plane across approximately 3-4 miles dist..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/perspective/46472493_2088535031199472_4494556822836871168_o-1.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
