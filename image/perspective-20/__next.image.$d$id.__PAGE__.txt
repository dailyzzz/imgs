Left shows red brick house with observers at ground level (purple horizontal line represents ground/eye level). Yellow circles represent sun positions along two paths: top horizontal blue line shows sun's actual level path parallel to ground, bottom diagonal blue line shows sun's apparent visual path descending toward horizon due to perspective. Multiple human figures shown walking on sloped brown ground plane between houses of decreasing size. Gray lines from distant sun positions show light rays reaching observer. Red text label 'Atmospheric Lensing' with blue curved arrow indicates atmospheric refraction effect bending light near horizon. Demonstrates how sun traveling horizontally appears to descend and set due to perspective convergence and atmospheric lensing, without requiring curved Earth."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-19","title":"Perspective 19","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/37203617_10205036660591760_6481028739684630528_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'HOW DOES A SUNSET WORK IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?' Left panel shows yellow corridor/hallway with red columns and ceiling lights converging toward vanishing point, demonstrating linear perspective. Right inset panel labeled 'SUN TRAIL' shows long-exposure photograph of sun's path creating diagonal light streak across evening sky with silhouetted mountains below (credited to Nick Havok). Bottom text: 'AS THE SUN MOVES AWAY, DUE TO PERSPECTIVE ON A PLANE IT APPEARS TO DROP DOWN AS IT CONVERGES AT THE VANISHING POINT'. Uses corridor perspective as analogy for how sun appears to descend toward horizon due to perspective convergence rather than actual vertical movement. Argues sunset is visual effect of perspective on flat plane, not sun moving below curved Earth horizon."},"nextImage":{"id":"perspective-21","title":"Perspective 21","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/48365584_2365589123469467_2205458946217476096_n.jpeg","description":"Six-panel comparison meme demonstrating perspective on flat surfaces. Top text: 'the coin doesn't disappear over curvature (table is flat)'. Left three panels show hand holding coin above flat wooden table surface at progressively lower heights, labeled 'sky' (coin high above table), 'ground' (coin at table level), and bottom panel shows coin on table surface with perspective grid overlay. Right three panels show sunset over ocean from pier/boardwalk perspective with silhouetted figures and bikes, demonstrating sun at different heights: above horizon labeled 'sky', at horizon level labeled 'ground', and below horizon with perspective grid overlay. Bottom panel shows perspective grid lines converging on both table surface and ocean horizon. Large bottom text: 'NEITHER DOES SUN.' with 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' logo and '@rum_bellator' credit. Argues sun setting below horizon is perspective effect identical to coin appearing to sink below table edge when viewed at ground level, not evidence of Earth curvature."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
