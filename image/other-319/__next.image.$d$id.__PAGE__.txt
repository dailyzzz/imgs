3:Tafc,Curved reflections comparison questioning why ocean reflections aren't distorted if Earth is curved. Three-panel photographic comparison questioning reflection distortion on curved versus flat surfaces. Top left shows Chicago Cloud Gate sculpture (The Bean) - famous public art installation in Millennium Park. Highly polished stainless steel elliptical sculpture with mirror-like surface reflecting surrounding cityscape. Sculpture's curved surface creates dramatic distorted reflections of buildings, sky, people. Visible reflections show Chicago skyscrapers stretched and warped across Bean's convex surface. Person standing beneath arch for scale. Urban plaza visible with stone pavement. Top right shows same Bean sculpture photographed from ground level looking up at underside - convex mirrored surface shows heavily distorted reflections of photographer, buildings, environment. Reflections stretched and curved following Bean's elliptical geometry. Gray pavement visible. Middle text overlay on black bar in white sans-serif font: 'IF THE OCEANS ARE CURVED, WHY DOESN'T ANYONE OBSERVE DISTORTED REFLECTIONS?' Bottom panel shows serene ocean scene with perfect mirror-like reflection. Calm water surface appearing absolutely flat and smooth like glass. Sky above filled with white fluffy cumulus clouds against medium blue background. Water below shows nearly perfect reflection of clouds - white cloud shapes mirrored in blue water creating symmetrical composition. Small wooden boat/canoe visible floating on water in foreground center, also reflected perfectly. Horizon line divides image horizontally. Water appears completely undistorted acting as perfect mirror. Lower left shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' attribution. Meme argues if Earth's oceans are curved, reflections should be distorted like reflections on Bean's curved surface. Since ocean reflections appear undistorted, water must be flat. However, this misunderstands scale and geometry. Bean sculpture has tight curvature radius of ~10 meters - observer standing nearby sees dramatic curve across entire visible surface. Earth's radius is 6,371 km (6,371,000 meters) - curvature so gentle that local area appears flat. Ocean surface curves following Earth's sphere, but over distances of meters/kilometers curve is imperceptible. Water acts as locally flat mirror while globally curving. Reflections depend on angle of incidence - on calm water, light reflects at consistent angles creating clear mirror images regardless of large-scale curvature. Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon proves water does curve - can't see across large distances because curved water surface blocks view. Bean distortions result from tight compound curves visible within arm's reach, not comparable to gentle planetary curvature invisible at human scale4:Tad9,Morpheus Matrix meme about flat Earth research overcoming lifetime of indoctrination. Popular internet meme format using Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus from The Matrix. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WHAT IF I TOLD YOU IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN JUST A FEW MINUTES OF FLAT EARTH RESEARCH'. Image shows Morpheus from 1999 film The Matrix in iconic scene. African American man (Laurence Fishburne) wearing dark purple suit jacket over dark navy/purple shirt, sitting in distinctive maroon/burgundy leather chair with ornate carved details. He sits in relaxed confident pose with left elbow resting on chair arm, hand near chin in contemplative gesture. Wears small circular sunglasses with dark lenses (his signature look). Expression shows calm knowing confidence. Background shows period interior with vintage rotary telephone visible on small table beside chair - black classic phone with handset resting in cradle. Warm atmospheric lighting creates film noir aesthetic with muted colors and dramatic shadows. Room appears to be from early-mid 20th century with antique furniture and decor. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters with black outline: 'TO OVERCOME A LIFETIME OF INDOCTRINATION'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme format based on Morpheus's role as mentor figure offering protagonist Neo choice between red pill (truth/reality) and blue pill (comfortable illusion). Famous line 'What if I told you...' (actually not in film but became associated meme format) used to introduce uncomfortable truths challenging mainstream beliefs. In this context, suggests accepting flat Earth requires extensive research and willingness to overcome decades of education teaching spherical Earth. Positions flat Earth belief as difficult enlightenment process requiring deprogramming from societal indoctrination. Implies mainstream education is brainwashing rather than fact-based teaching. However, extensive research into flat Earth claims reveals they're based on misunderstandings of physics, perspective, scale, and evidence. Genuine research into Earth's shape through history shows: Eratosthenes calculated circumference in 240 BC using shadows, ships disappear hull-first over horizon, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones exist, Foucault pendulum demonstrates rotation, satellite communications require spherical geometry, circumnavigation possible, seasons explained by axial tilt, lunar eclipses show round Earth shadow, physics of planetary formation requires spheres above certain mass. Accepting flat Earth actually requires rejecting centuries of evidence and embracing confirmation bias. Real scientific inquiry involves examining all evidence objectively, not predetermined conclusion5:Tb5e,NASA technical document excerpt highlighting 'flat nonrotating earth' phrase taken out of context. Scanned page from NASA technical report showing mathematical equations and text with selective highlighting to suggest NASA admits Earth is flat. Top section displays complex mathematical matrices and equations - linearized system matrices labeled C22 showing partial derivatives, trigonometric functions (cos, sin), and variables. Second matrix shows C inverse (C^-1) written as partitioned matrix with subpartitions. Technical aerospace/flight dynamics mathematics involving coordinate transformations and reference frames. Middle section titled '3 CONCLUDING REMARKS' in bold serif font. Body text reads: 'This report derives and defines a set of linearized system matrices for a rigid aircraft of constant mass, flying in a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth.' Phrase 'a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth' highlighted in yellow. Text continues: 'Both generalized and standard linear system equations are derived from nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom equations of motion and a large collection of nonlinear observation (measurement) equations.' Next paragraph states: 'This derivation of a linear model is general and makes no assumptions on either the reference (nominal) trajectory about which the model is linearized or the symmetry of the vehicle mass and aerodynamic properties.' Phrase 'makes no assumptions' outlined in red box. Bottom shows document attribution: 'Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Facility, National Aeronautics and Space Administration' highlighted in yellow, followed by 'Edwards, California, January 8, 1987'. Lower right corner shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community frequently cites this document as NASA 'admission' that Earth is flat. However, this completely misrepresents technical document purpose. Report describes mathematical model for aircraft flight simulation - linearized equations simplify complex flight dynamics calculations. Assuming 'flat nonrotating earth' is standard simplification for local flight modeling over short distances/durations where Earth's curvature and rotation have negligible effect on aircraft behavior. Similar to how architects assume flat ground when designing buildings - valid approximation at local scale even though Earth is spherical. Document explicitly states model makes no assumptions about reference trajectory - meaning flat Earth assumption is just convenient mathematical simplification for computational efficiency, not claim about actual Earth shape. NASA has thousands of documents, photos, and missions definitively showing spherical Earth. Taking phrase out of context from technical simulation paper demonstrates confirmation bias - seizing on specific words while ignoring document's actual purpose and NASA's overwhelming evidence for spherical Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-319","title":"Other 319","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791057_469314683268271_6337968302255732564_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-318","title":"Other 318","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12790840_469275703272169_3170264075263137737_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-320","title":"Other 320","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791096_469429403256799_5841742650296640406_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
