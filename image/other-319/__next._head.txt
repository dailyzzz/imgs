5:Tafc,Curved reflections comparison questioning why ocean reflections aren't distorted if Earth is curved. Three-panel photographic comparison questioning reflection distortion on curved versus flat surfaces. Top left shows Chicago Cloud Gate sculpture (The Bean) - famous public art installation in Millennium Park. Highly polished stainless steel elliptical sculpture with mirror-like surface reflecting surrounding cityscape. Sculpture's curved surface creates dramatic distorted reflections of buildings, sky, people. Visible reflections show Chicago skyscrapers stretched and warped across Bean's convex surface. Person standing beneath arch for scale. Urban plaza visible with stone pavement. Top right shows same Bean sculpture photographed from ground level looking up at underside - convex mirrored surface shows heavily distorted reflections of photographer, buildings, environment. Reflections stretched and curved following Bean's elliptical geometry. Gray pavement visible. Middle text overlay on black bar in white sans-serif font: 'IF THE OCEANS ARE CURVED, WHY DOESN'T ANYONE OBSERVE DISTORTED REFLECTIONS?' Bottom panel shows serene ocean scene with perfect mirror-like reflection. Calm water surface appearing absolutely flat and smooth like glass. Sky above filled with white fluffy cumulus clouds against medium blue background. Water below shows nearly perfect reflection of clouds - white cloud shapes mirrored in blue water creating symmetrical composition. Small wooden boat/canoe visible floating on water in foreground center, also reflected perfectly. Horizon line divides image horizontally. Water appears completely undistorted acting as perfect mirror. Lower left shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' attribution. Meme argues if Earth's oceans are curved, reflections should be distorted like reflections on Bean's curved surface. Since ocean reflections appear undistorted, water must be flat. However, this misunderstands scale and geometry. Bean sculpture has tight curvature radius of ~10 meters - observer standing nearby sees dramatic curve across entire visible surface. Earth's radius is 6,371 km (6,371,000 meters) - curvature so gentle that local area appears flat. Ocean surface curves following Earth's sphere, but over distances of meters/kilometers curve is imperceptible. Water acts as locally flat mirror while globally curving. Reflections depend on angle of incidence - on calm water, light reflects at consistent angles creating clear mirror images regardless of large-scale curvature. Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon proves water does curve - can't see across large distances because curved water surface blocks view. Bean distortions result from tight compound curves visible within arm's reach, not comparable to gentle planetary curvature invisible at human scale0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 319 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Curved reflections comparison questioning why ocean reflections aren't distorted if Earth is curved.
