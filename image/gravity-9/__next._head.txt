5:T61b,Alternative gravity theory infographic with dark gradient background (gray-green-brown) and yellow person icon at bottom. White text at top: 'The roof of the sky is 100% closed and it is completely flat. This roof is the gas in the earth. This is why air pressure will be produced inside the earth. Everything under the roof of the sky has a special density and weight.' Presents atmospheric density explanation with four gas layers labeled in yellow: 'hydrogen' and 'Helium' at top (brown section), 'Nitrogen' in middle (teal section), 'Oxygen' at bottom (gray section). Each section includes cyan text explaining properties. Top: 'The reason for the leveling of water surfaces is the effect of atmospheric pressure, And the waves of the sea moving by the wind.' Middle: 'Gases have their own weight and density and they accumulate on top of each other'. Lower middle: 'Your body is fixed on the ground and you take up space in the air particles, unless you affect you like a wind'. Bottom: Yellow icon with text 'Considering that above you the roof of the sky is closed and it prevents the leakage of gases from inside the ground. Your body has its own density and mass, and that's what makes the objects stand on the ground.' Final section: 'Heavy gases such as ethane, methane, propane and butane. Are located inside the earth because they are higher in weight and weight than oxygen gas.' Proposes alternative to gravity using atmospheric pressure, gas density stratification, and enclosed firmament dome model to explain why objects fall and remain grounded0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 9 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Alternative gravity theory infographic with dark gradient background (gray-green-brown) and yellow person icon at bottom.
