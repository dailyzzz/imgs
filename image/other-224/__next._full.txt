13:T58a,Aerial photograph above clouds showing flat horizon with Mount Fuji. Shows stunning high-altitude aerial view from airplane window. Sky gradient from deep navy blue at top transitioning to lighter blue in middle section. Thick layer of white-gray clouds fills lower two-thirds creating cotton-like textured blanket extending to horizon. Clouds show variations in density, some areas thicker white, others wispy translucent. Most prominent feature: snow-capped Mount Fuji (iconic Japanese volcano) rising through cloud layer in lower center-right. Mountain shows distinctive symmetrical cone shape with white snow covering peak, darker volcanic rock visible on slopes, shadow cast on clouds below. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across image where clouds meet sky. Perspective from high altitude (likely 30,000-40,000 feet commercial flight). Top displays large white text: 'FLATNESS'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Image used as evidence that horizon always appears flat at eye level regardless of altitude. Flat Earth proponents argue if Earth were sphere, horizon should show visible curve from this altitude. Claims flat horizon proves flat plane rather than curved surface. Mainstream science explains horizon appears flat due to Earth's large size (8,000 mile diameter) - curvature is too gradual to perceive from these altitudes without fisheye lens14:T59a,Three bridge photographs demonstrating horizon as convergence line. Black background with white text header at top: 'The "horizon" is a line of convergence.' Three photographs arranged horizontally showing long bridges or causeways from driver's perspective. Left image shows aerial view of cable-stayed bridge with single tall white pylon/tower, white roadway stretching into distance over blue water, surrounded by green land. Sky gradient light to medium blue. Center image shows ground-level view driving on bridge roadway - white concrete lanes with yellow center line, gray barriers on sides, overcast sky, water visible both sides. Getty Images watermark visible. Right image shows similar ground-level bridge view - tan/beige roadway with white center line, water on both sides, light blue sky with white clouds, bridge appears to extend straight to horizon. White text at bottom: 'Not the curvature of a ball.' All three images show straight horizontal lines where water meets sky at eye level. Flat Earth argument claims what mainstream science calls 'horizon' caused by Earth's curvature is actually vanishing point where parallel lines appear to converge due to perspective, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at distance. Claims bridges appear to rise to meet horizon due to perspective compression, not because they follow Earth's curve. Argues true curve would show bridge descending away from observer15:T591,Antarctic Treaty flag design with azimuthal projection. Shows simplified flag or emblem design on dark navy blue background. Center displays white silhouette of Antarctica continent showing irregular coastline with peninsulas, bays, indentations. Antarctica positioned at center with North Pole/Arctic perspective. Surrounding continent are concentric white circles representing latitude lines at regular intervals. Radiating from center point are straight white lines extending outward like compass rays or longitude lines - approximately 12-16 lines creating pie-slice sections. Lines extend beyond outer circle to edges of image. Design creates azimuthal equidistant projection pattern with Antarctica at pole position. This is actual design of Antarctic Treaty flag adopted in 1959, also used as United Nations emblem. Flat Earth proponents cite this flag as evidence that governments know true Earth map. Argue Antarctica positioned at center with radiating longitude lines matches flat Earth model where Antarctica forms ice wall perimeter and continents radiate from North Pole center. Antarctic Treaty of 1959 established Antarctica as scientific preserve and banned military activity. Conspiracy theorists claim treaty exists to prevent exploration of ice wall and keep flat Earth secret. UN flag uses identical azimuthal equidistant projection, which flat Earthers interpret as hidden truth displayed in plain sight9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-224","title":"Other 224","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654693_460135770852829_6611736404814185123_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-223","title":"Other 223","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654673_463012263898513_1204418471088636272_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-225","title":"Other 225","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12657265_461770377356035_3408845659044911063_o.png","description":"$15"}}]
