5:T58a,Aerial photograph above clouds showing flat horizon with Mount Fuji. Shows stunning high-altitude aerial view from airplane window. Sky gradient from deep navy blue at top transitioning to lighter blue in middle section. Thick layer of white-gray clouds fills lower two-thirds creating cotton-like textured blanket extending to horizon. Clouds show variations in density, some areas thicker white, others wispy translucent. Most prominent feature: snow-capped Mount Fuji (iconic Japanese volcano) rising through cloud layer in lower center-right. Mountain shows distinctive symmetrical cone shape with white snow covering peak, darker volcanic rock visible on slopes, shadow cast on clouds below. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across image where clouds meet sky. Perspective from high altitude (likely 30,000-40,000 feet commercial flight). Top displays large white text: 'FLATNESS'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Image used as evidence that horizon always appears flat at eye level regardless of altitude. Flat Earth proponents argue if Earth were sphere, horizon should show visible curve from this altitude. Claims flat horizon proves flat plane rather than curved surface. Mainstream science explains horizon appears flat due to Earth's large size (8,000 mile diameter) - curvature is too gradual to perceive from these altitudes without fisheye lens0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 224 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Aerial photograph above clouds showing flat horizon with Mount Fuji.
