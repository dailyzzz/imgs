Central wireframe pyramid/rectangular structure contains figure standing at base with moon or light source above. Yellow text labels 'DIVERGENT', 'CONVERGENT' appear multiple times around perimeter indicating different perspective zones. White 'Horizon' label marks middle horizontal plane. Green ground plane at bottom. Blue radiating lines emanate from multiple vanishing points creating perspective grid effect. Demonstrates how observer perceives convergent lines (moving toward vanishing point) versus divergent lines (moving away) in perspective matrix framework, with horizon as key reference plane at eye level."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-13","title":"Perspective 13","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36747093_1791169220964168_824079541201797120_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with red header banner stating '\"YOU FLAT EARTHERS ARE STUPID.

Image overlaid with multiple white and cyan parallel lines radiating from vanishing point at horizon (marked by red horizontal line) throughout sky and ground. Text labels 'Converging parallel lines' appear multiple times across top half and 'Diverging parallel lines' in upper corners. Shows how parallel lines in physical space (road edges, lane markings) appear to converge toward single point on horizon due to perspective, while lines above and below horizon converge at different rates. Person positioned centrally to emphasize observer's eye level at horizon line. Clear blue sky with clouds above, flat terrain below. Real-world demonstration of perspective principles."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
