Shows three yellow suns decreasing in size vertically on left, three airplanes decreasing in size on right, and central illustration of perspective view looking down railway tracks with telegraph poles alongside road. Railway tracks and telegraph poles converge toward 'Vanishing Point' at horizon line (labeled with arrows). Text demonstrates how objects moving away appear to move downward toward horizon due to perspective, not because they're actually descending. Large black text at bottom: 'Perspective'. Argues sun and aircraft appear to set or descend due to perspective principle, not actual vertical movement or Earth curvature."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-10","title":"Perspective 10","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36611265_10216100038197458_2838430962646253568_n.jpeg","description":"Educational diagram explaining perspective error with black background and white text panel. Top text reads: 'The error in perspective, which is almost universally committed, consists in causing lines dissimilarly distant from the eye-line to converge to one and the same vanishing point. Whereas it is demonstrable that lines most distant from an eye-line must of necessity converge less rapidly, and must be carried further over the eye-line before they meet it at the angle one minute, which constitutes the vanishing point.' Below shows illustration with figure standing on left observing series of progressively shorter vertical black pillars or rectangles arranged in perspective view, converging toward horizon line (marked with yellow arrow). Yellow arrows label 'EYE LEVEL' at observer's height and 'HORIZON' at ground level where pillars meet vanishing point. Demonstrates technical principle that distant objects converge to vanishing point at different rates depending on distance from eye level."},"nextImage":{"id":"perspective-12","title":"Perspective 12","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36683993_910714025797349_5805879074962276352_n.jpeg","description":"Technical diagram explaining bottom-up disappearance of receding objects. Left panel shows three identical skyscrapers (resembling Chrysler Building) numbered 1, 2, 3 with red angular sight lines emanating from eye point showing how viewing angle decreases with distance. Below shows protractor/angle measurement diagram with red radiating lines and blue horizontal line at eye level. Right panel on black background contains white text: 'Receding objects APPEAR to vanish bottom first because the top of the object is further from the level of the eye than is the bottom. Therefore, a greater distance is required for the top of the object to reach the same vanishing angle (0.017°) as the bottom.' Demonstrates angular resolution principle explaining why distant objects appear to sink bottom-first without requiring Earth curvature."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
