5:T4c1,Multi-panel educational diagram explaining ship perspective and angular resolution. Top banner text with yellow highlight: 'The "sinking" appearance of a departing ship relative to the observers horizon is due to Perspective and Angular resolution where we become unable to distinguish between the ship and the horizon'. Top panel shows silhouette sequence of cargo ship becoming progressively smaller approaching horizon with sun in background, text 'Bottom of ships disappear'. Middle panel shows real photograph of naval fleet at sea with arrow pointing to ships with text 'Bottom of ships disappear'. Third panel titled '#AngularResolution' shows three progressively smaller spheres on beige surface demonstrating size/distance relationship. Bottom panel shows three circular images with decreasing resolution demonstrating optical limitation. Bottom text: 'Angular resolution or spatial resolution describes the ability of any image-forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye, to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of image resolution'. Argues ships appear to sink due to perspective and optical limits, not Earth curvature.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Perspective 5 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Multi-panel educational diagram explaining ship perspective and angular resolution.
