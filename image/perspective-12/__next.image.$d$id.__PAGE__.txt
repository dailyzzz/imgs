Left panel shows three identical skyscrapers (resembling Chrysler Building) numbered 1, 2, 3 with red angular sight lines emanating from eye point showing how viewing angle decreases with distance. Below shows protractor/angle measurement diagram with red radiating lines and blue horizontal line at eye level. Right panel on black background contains white text: 'Receding objects APPEAR to vanish bottom first because the top of the object is further from the level of the eye than is the bottom. Therefore, a greater distance is required for the top of the object to reach the same vanishing angle (0.017°) as the bottom.' Demonstrates angular resolution principle explaining why distant objects appear to sink bottom-first without requiring Earth curvature."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-11","title":"Perspective 11","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36615996_10216100043757597_33270083690168320_n.jpeg","description":"Educational diagram with light blue background titled 'The Jet, Powerlines, and the Sun are not Moving Down, They're Moving Away'. Shows three yellow suns decreasing in size vertically on left, three airplanes decreasing in size on right, and central illustration of perspective view looking down railway tracks with telegraph poles alongside road. Railway tracks and telegraph poles converge toward 'Vanishing Point' at horizon line (labeled with arrows). Text demonstrates how objects moving away appear to move downward toward horizon due to perspective, not because they're actually descending. Large black text at bottom: 'Perspective'. Argues sun and aircraft appear to set or descend due to perspective principle, not actual vertical movement or Earth curvature."},"nextImage":{"id":"perspective-13","title":"Perspective 13","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36747093_1791169220964168_824079541201797120_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with red header banner stating '\"YOU FLAT EARTHERS ARE STUPID.
