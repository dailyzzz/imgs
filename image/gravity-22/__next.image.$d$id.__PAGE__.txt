3:T435,Complex alternative physics diagram comparing diamagnetism versus gravity. Top left shows flat Earth model with dome and text 'THE SUN AND MOON ARE CAUGHT IN EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD' with green magnetic field lines and caption explaining 24-hour rotation. Top right shows similar dome with downward magnetic force labeled 'THE MAGNETIC FIELD ALSO HAS A DOWNWARD FORCE' explaining diamagnetism as substitute for gravity. Middle section titled 'DIAMAGNETISM (VS) MASSES BENDING SPACE:' shows three panels: left with mouse being repelled by magnets labeled 'MOUSE IS REPELLED IN REAL-TIME' referencing diamagnetism, center showing diagram of curved spacetime grid with arrows and 'OBSERVER MUST STAND BACK & RELY ON MEASUREMENT' labeled 'CAVENDISH!', right showing clock and Nikola Tesla quote about space curvature being incorrect. Bottom shows Newton quote describing aether as medium through which light flows and magnetic field is distributed, concluding 'Earth's magnetic field is the aether.' Proposes diamagnetism and magnetic fields explain phenomena attributed to gravity.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-22","title":"Gravity 22","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/54256835_10156104503436770_963260275711016960_n.jpeg","description":"Humorous illustration titled 'GRAVITY' showing six bottles of hot sauce with labels reading 'Gravity HOT SAUCE' in various red and white bottle designs, with text below reading 'The magic sauce you can put on any heliocentric problem' and black banner at bottom stating 'Available at all fine indoctrination camps'"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-21","title":"Gravity 21","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/50429465_2310032875945807_1420219769230983168_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-23","title":"Gravity 23","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/57222201_10161728225445626_364624920790958080_n.jpeg","description":"Educational comparison titled 'What is Gravity?' showing Newton versus Einstein's theories. Left side features portrait of Isaac Newton with formula F = Gm₁m₂/r² and text in green 'It's a force. It depends on mass.' Right side shows portrait of Albert Einstein with formula Gμν = 8πGTμν and text in yellow 'It's a distortion of space & time. It depends on energy.' Three red dots connect the competing theories vertically. Bottom text on dark blue background explains: 'As we have seen, matter does not simply pull on other matter across empty space, as Newton had imagined. Rather matter distorts space-time and it is this distorted space-time that in turn affects other matter.' Presents fundamental conceptual difference between Newtonian gravity as force between masses versus Einsteinian gravity as geometric curvature of spacetime caused by energy-mass."}}],null,["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","$5",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@6"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
