Black text panel at top states: 'An airliner climbs and levels off at its cruising altitude. For the duration of the flight, the pilot never points the nose downward to follow the earth's curve, but the plane never gains altitude. Think about that.' Questions why aircraft maintain level flight without continuous downward adjustment if Earth curves, suggesting pilots fly level over flat surface rather than following spherical curvature.

Document lists simplifying assumptions for flight dynamics including: 'There is a flat Earth. (The Earth's curvature is zero.)', 'There is a non-rotating Earth. (No Coriolis accelerations and such are present.)', 'The aircraft has constant mass', plus additional assumptions about rigid body, symmetry, rotating masses, and constant wind.
