13:T1bc5,Artistic rendering of Mars landing with astronauts planting American flag, comparing moon landing to Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing as "media hoaxes" and warning future Mars mission will be similar deception. Deeply offensive conspiracy theory image grouping space exploration denial with denial of real tragedies where innocent people died. IMAGE: Artistic/CGI rendering of hypothetical Mars landing scene showing astronauts on Martian surface with American flag. Not actual photograph - appears to be digital art or movie/promotional image depicting future Mars mission concept. MARS SURFACE: Red-orange rocky terrain characteristic of Mars depictions. Dusty, barren landscape with rocky outcrops. Reddish-brown coloring throughout surface. Hazy pinkish-tan sky typical of Mars atmosphere renderings. Surface appears rough and cratered. Equipment and structures visible in background suggesting established base or landing site. ASTRONAUTS: Two astronauts in white spacesuits visible in foreground. Standing together near American flag. Spacesuits appear modern design - more advanced than Apollo-era suits. Helmets and life support systems visible. Posture suggests ceremonial flag-planting moment - recreating iconic Apollo imagery for Mars context. AMERICAN FLAG: Large US flag prominently displayed - stars and stripes clearly visible. Flag mounted on pole, appearing to wave (though Mars has thin atmosphere). Patriotic imagery central to composition. Echoes Apollo 11 moon landing flag photograph. BACKGROUND ELEMENTS: Various equipment and structures visible behind astronauts. Appears to show habitat modules or landing craft. Suggests established presence rather than initial landing. Multiple pieces of equipment scattered across landscape. TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "If you thought the moon landing, Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing were bad media hoaxes" - Groups three completely different events as equivalent "hoaxes." BOTTOM TEXT: "WAIT UNTIL WE 'WALK ON MARS'" - Quotation marks around "walk on Mars" indicate skepticism that future Mars mission would be real. Predicts Mars mission will be faked like moon landing allegedly was. "Nick Havok" attribution visible. "fb.com/fematters" source watermark. DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC CONTENT: This image is particularly harmful because it: 1) EQUATES SPACE EXPLORATION WITH TRAGEDY DENIAL: Groups Apollo moon landing (space achievement) with Sandy Hook (2012 school shooting killing 20 children and 6 adults) and Boston Marathon Bombing (2013 terrorist attack killing 3 and injuring hundreds). Treats denial of real human tragedies as equivalent to space skepticism. 2) SANDY HOOK DENIAL: Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut was real tragedy. 20 first-grade children and 6 staff members were murdered. Conspiracy theories claiming it was "staged" or "hoax" have caused immense additional suffering to grieving families. Families have faced harassment, death threats, and had to move repeatedly due to conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones was sued and found liable for defamation for promoting Sandy Hook denial, resulting in nearly $1.5 billion in damages. 3) BOSTON BOMBING DENIAL: Boston Marathon Bombing on April 15, 2013 killed 3 people and injured over 260. Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified, pursued, and one killed, one captured and later executed. Extensive video evidence, witness testimony, and criminal trial confirmed reality. Denial causes additional pain to victims and survivors. CONSPIRACY THEORY PROGRESSION: Image demonstrates how conspiracy thinking escalates: Starts with relatively "harmless" space skepticism (moon landing denial). Progresses to denial of documented tragedies (mass shootings, terrorist attacks). Creates framework where ANY official narrative can be dismissed as "hoax." Desensitizes believers to dismissing real human suffering. Builds community around shared "forbidden knowledge" regardless of harm caused. FLAT EARTH CONNECTION: While flat Earth and tragedy denial are separate conspiracy theories, they share: Distrust of all official sources. Belief in massive coordinated deception. Community bonding through shared "awakening." Rejection of evidence as fabricated. This image appearing in flat Earth community shows overlap between space denial and broader conspiracy ecosystem. MOON LANDING CLAIMS: Image assumes moon landing was hoax without presenting evidence. Apollo program extensively documented with thousands of photographs, hours of video, hundreds of pounds of moon rocks, scientific experiments still operating today (laser reflectors), independent verification by rival nations (USSR tracked missions), and recent orbital photography of landing sites. MARS MISSION PREDICTION: Image predicts future Mars mission will also be "faked." Implies pattern of space deception will continue. "Wait until" framing suggests upcoming hoax believers should prepare to recognize. Creates unfalsifiable prediction - any future Mars mission will be dismissed as fake regardless of evidence. SCIENTIFIC REALITY: Moon landings: Verified by multiple independent sources including former Soviet Union. Physical evidence (moon rocks) analyzed by scientists worldwide. Retroreflectors placed on Moon still used for laser ranging experiments. Landing sites photographed by multiple nations' lunar orbiters. Sandy Hook: Exhaustively documented tragedy. Death certificates, autopsies, funerals, grieving families, criminal investigation, subsequent legislation. Denying it is not "skepticism" - it's cruelty toward victims' families. Boston Bombing: Captured on multiple surveillance cameras. Perpetrators identified, pursued in televised manhunt, one killed in shootout, one tried and convicted with overwhelming evidence. Survivors with permanent injuries from bombing still alive today. VISUAL RHETORIC: Mars imagery is aspirational/inspirational - appeals to space exploration excitement. Astronauts with flag evokes patriotism and American achievement. Professional-looking rendering suggests legitimacy. Combining appealing visuals with harmful conspiracy text normalizes tragedy denial. Format makes extreme claims seem like reasonable skepticism. HARM CAUSED: Images like this: Spread misinformation about real tragedies. Cause additional trauma to victims' families who encounter denial. Normalize dismissing documented events as "hoaxes." Create pipeline from space skepticism to harmful conspiracy theories. Build communities where any official narrative is suspect. Make it socially acceptable to deny mass casualty events. RESPONSE: This image should be recognized as harmful conspiracy content that: Groups legitimate space skepticism (however misguided) with cruel denial of real tragedies. Causes measurable harm to real people (Sandy Hook families, Boston survivors). Represents escalation of conspiracy thinking into dangerous territory. Should not be normalized or treated as equivalent to other flat Earth content. The families of Sandy Hook victims and Boston bombing survivors deserve better than having their loved ones' deaths dismissed as "media hoaxes."14:T1e99,Globe illustration with world landmarks wishing for 2016 to be "the year when people remembered that science is a method of investigation and not a belief system." Flat Earth meme appropriating scientific skepticism language to position flat Earth as legitimate inquiry versus mainstream science as dogmatic belief. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Artistic globe illustration with famous landmarks positioned around Earth, combined with motivational New Year's wish text criticizing mainstream science as belief system. CENTRAL GLOBE: Stylized spherical Earth illustration showing continents and oceans. Blue planet representation with recognizable continental shapes. Clouds/atmosphere visible around globe. Artistic rendering rather than photographic image. Ironically uses globe illustration in flat Earth content - though image criticizes mainstream science, not specifically globe Earth shape. WORLD LANDMARKS: Famous structures positioned around globe as if standing on surface: STATUE OF LIBERTY (New York, USA): Green copper statue visible on left side. Classic torch-bearing figure representing American liberty. LEANING TOWER OF PISA (Italy): Distinctive tilted white marble tower. Medieval Italian architecture landmark. BIG BEN/ELIZABETH TOWER (London, UK): Iconic clock tower from UK Parliament. Gothic Revival architecture style. EIFFEL TOWER (Paris, France): Iron lattice tower, most famous Parisian landmark. SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE: Distinctive shell-shaped roof structure visible. Landmarks represent global human achievement and civilization - suggests worldwide scope of discussion about science. AIRPLANE: Commercial aircraft flying across top of image. Suggests international travel and modern technology. Also represents aerial perspective of Earth. SKY BACKGROUND: Blue sky with white clouds. Bright, optimistic atmospheric conditions. Suggests clarity, openness, enlightenment. TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "I WOULD LIKE 2016 TO BE THE YEAR" - New Year's wish format (image dated from 2016 based on Facebook timestamp pattern). RIGHT SIDE TEXT: "When people remembered that science is a method of investigation," - First part of core message. BOTTOM TEXT: "AND NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM" - Conclusion of argument. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SCIENCE IS METHOD, NOT DOGMA: Image appropriates valid philosophical point - science IS a method (hypothesis, testing, revision) not a fixed set of conclusions. Flat Earthers argue that mainstream "scientists" treat conclusions (spherical Earth, evolution, etc.) as sacred beliefs rather than testable hypotheses. Calling something "science" doesn't make it true - only evidence and testing do. 2) SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT AS RELIGION: Implication is that modern science has become faith-based belief system where questioning established conclusions is treated as heresy. Scientists who challenge consensus face career consequences. Peer review becomes enforcement mechanism for orthodoxy. Scientific "consensus" is appeal to authority, not evidence. 3) FLAT EARTH AS TRUE SKEPTICISM: If science is method, then everything should be open to question - including Earth's shape. Flat Earthers claim they're applying scientific method by questioning assumptions. Demanding evidence for globe Earth is what scientists SHOULD do. Those who refuse to question globe are being religious, not scientific. 4) INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION: Image encourages people to investigate claims themselves rather than trust authorities. Don't believe Earth is round because scientists say so - test it yourself. Personal observation and experiment should override expert consensus. TRUE NATURE OF SCIENCE: While image makes superficially valid point (science IS method), it misrepresents how science actually works: 1) SCIENCE DOES QUESTION ASSUMPTIONS: Scientific paradigm shifts happen regularly (plate tectonics, quantum mechanics, relativity). Scientists who overturn established theories WIN Nobel Prizes, don't face persecution. Difference: Successful challenges come with BETTER EVIDENCE and PREDICTIONS, not just contrarianism. 2) CONSENSUS BASED ON EVIDENCE: Scientific consensus on Earth's shape isn't "belief" - it's conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. Consensus can change when evidence warrants - but requires evidence, not assertion. Globe Earth "consensus" is actually verified millions of times daily by navigation, aviation, telecommunications, astronomy. 3) EXPERTISE MATTERS: "Do your own research" sounds democratic but ignores that some questions require specialized knowledge. Amateur investigations without proper methodology often reach wrong conclusions. Dunning-Kruger effect: Less knowledge = more confidence in incorrect conclusions. 4) FALSIFIABILITY: Scientific claims must be falsifiable - and globe Earth IS testable and has survived every test. Flat Earth claims are NOT falsifiable - any evidence against them is dismissed as fake. Which approach is more "scientific"? FALSE EQUIVALENCE: Image creates false equivalence between: Flat Earth believers questioning everything (presented as scientific skepticism). Scientists accepting evidence-based conclusions (presented as religious faith). But: Accepting conclusions supported by vast evidence isn't "belief" - it's rational. Rejecting evidence to maintain preferred conclusion IS belief-based thinking. Flat Earth community rejects photographic evidence, physics, navigation, astronomy - that's dogmatism, not skepticism. APPROPRIATION OF SKEPTICISM: Flat Earth community strategically uses language of skepticism and scientific method while practicing opposite: Claim to question everything - but don't question flat Earth assumptions. Claim to want evidence - but reject all evidence for globe Earth as "fake." Claim to use scientific method - but don't conduct controlled experiments with proper methodology. Claim mainstream science is biased - but use extreme confirmation bias themselves. This isn't skepticism - it's selective doubt applied only to conclusions they dislike while accepting preferred conclusions uncritically. 2016 CONTEXT: Image appears to be from early 2016 based on "2016 to be the year" framing. 2016 saw significant growth in flat Earth community via YouTube and social media. "Post-truth" discourse and distrust of institutions was expanding. Image reflects moment when flat Earth movement was gaining mainstream attention. VISUAL RHETORIC: Globe with landmarks is aspirational, positive imagery - world civilization and human achievement. Motivational New Year's wish format feels optimistic, constructive. Message sounds reasonable without context - who could disagree that science is method? Clean, professional design suggests legitimate source. Doesn't explicitly mention flat Earth - works as gateway content attracting those skeptical of institutions before introducing specific flat Earth claims. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works because: Core claim (science = method) is technically true. Doesn't immediately reveal flat Earth agenda. Appeals to values most people share (questioning, evidence). Creates feeling of intellectual sophistication. Positions flat Earthers as true scientists, mainstream as dogmatists. Effective entry point for flat Earth recruitment - agree with reasonable premise, then accept flat Earth conclusions as logical extension. IRONY: Image uses globe illustration to criticize "belief" in globe Earth. Calls for questioning assumptions while assuming flat Earth without evidence. Demands scientific method while flat Earth fails basic scientific testing. Claims others are dogmatic while flat Earth community rejects all contrary evidence. Meta-irony: Message about science being method (not belief) is correct - and when properly applied to flat Earth claim, scientific method conclusively demonstrates Earth is spherical.15:T1967,Earth from space against starfield with text claiming "It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space." Flat Earth meme demanding continuous full-Earth rotation video as proof of spherical spinning planet, arguing absence of such footage proves Earth doesn't spin or isn't sphere. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Classic "Earth from space" photograph showing full disk of planet against black star-filled background with flat Earth argument text overlay. EARTH IMAGE: Full disk photograph of Earth showing planet as complete sphere. Blue oceans dominate visible hemisphere. White cloud formations swirling across surface - weather patterns visible. Continental landmasses visible - appears to show Western Hemisphere (Americas) or view including North America. Atmospheric haze visible at edges creating soft limb against black space. Terminator line (day/night boundary) may be visible depending on sun angle. Classic "Blue Marble" style photograph. SPACE BACKGROUND: Black space surrounding Earth. Stars visible as white points of light scattered across background. Colorful nebula-like formations visible - purple, blue, green cosmic clouds. This artistic starfield background suggests image may be composite or enhanced for visual appeal. Authentic space photos typically show fewer visible stars due to camera exposure settings optimized for bright Earth. LIGHTING: Earth illuminated by sun from one side. Shadows and highlights show three-dimensional spherical shape. Cloud formations cast shadows on surface below. Consistent lighting across image suggests single light source (sun). TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "IT'S 2016" and "AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY VIDEO FOOTAGE" - Establishes time frame and makes claim about missing evidence. BOTTOM TEXT: "OF THE WHOLE EARTH SPINNING FROM SPACE" - Specifies what evidence flat Earthers claim is lacking. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SPINNING EARTH VIDEO: Flat Earthers claim there's no continuous video showing Earth as complete sphere rotating over 24-hour period. If Earth really spins, why can't we see video of it spinning? NASA should easily be able to provide this "obvious" proof. Absence of such video is presented as evidence that Earth doesn't spin or isn't spherical. 2) ALL IMAGES ARE COMPOSITES/CGI: Flat Earthers argue NASA Earth images are: Computer generated (CGI). Composites stitched from multiple photos. Artistic renderings, not photographs. None show "real" continuous spinning because it doesn't happen. 3) SATELLITE LIMITATIONS: Claim that satellites capable of filming whole Earth don't exist. Geostationary satellites are too close to see whole planet. Deep space probes are conveniently positioned where they can't film Earth spinning. 4) PROOF SHOULD BE EASY: With modern technology, continuous Earth rotation video should be trivial to obtain. The fact that NASA doesn't provide it suggests it's impossible because Earth doesn't actually spin. WHY THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG: 1) SUCH FOOTAGE EXISTS: DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite at L1 Lagrange point provides daily images of full Earth disk. EPIC camera on DSCOVR captures Earth every 1-2 hours showing rotation. Himawari-8 Japanese weather satellite provides full-disk images every 10 minutes. GOES weather satellites provide continuous Western/Eastern hemisphere views. Time-lapse compilations of these images clearly show Earth rotation. 2) PHYSICS OF ORBITAL OBSERVATION: Low Earth orbit satellites (ISS, most imaging satellites) orbit at 250-500 miles altitude - too close to see full disk. They see curved horizon, not complete sphere. Geostationary satellites at 22,236 miles see full disk but of one hemisphere (they're "stationary" relative to Earth's rotation). To see Earth spin, you need camera far from Earth that isn't orbiting (like DSCOVR at L1 point, 1 million miles away). 3) CAMERA EXPOSURE CHALLENGES: Earth is very bright compared to stars. Camera exposure settings that properly expose Earth make stars invisible. Camera settings that show stars overexpose Earth into white blob. This is basic photography - not evidence of fakery. Space photos with visible stars AND properly exposed Earth are composites (honestly labeled as such). 4) DSCOVR/EPIC SPECIFICALLY: DSCOVR satellite launched 2015 specifically provides full-disk Earth images. Located at L1 Lagrange point, 1 million miles from Earth toward Sun. EPIC camera captures full Earth every 1-2 hours. Images clearly show: Earth rotating (continents move across disk). Day/night terminator progressing. Moon passing between satellite and Earth (transit events). Weather systems developing and moving. All publicly available at NASA EPIC website. 5) TIME-LAPSE VIDEOS: Multiple time-lapse videos compiled from satellite imagery show Earth spinning. Japanese Himawari-8 footage particularly impressive - full disk every 10 minutes since 2015. Weather channel and others regularly broadcast this footage. "No video exists" claim is simply false - it's easily findable online. 2016 CONTEXT: Image dated 2016 based on text. DSCOVR launched February 2015, EPIC images available from mid-2015. By 2016, full-disk spinning Earth footage was already publicly available. Claim was already outdated when image was created. Either creator was unaware of DSCOVR/Himawari footage, or deliberately ignored it. MOVING GOALPOSTS: When confronted with DSCOVR/Himawari footage, flat Earthers typically: Claim footage is CGI (unfalsifiable). Claim footage doesn't show "real" spinning (special pleading). Demand different specific footage (moving goalposts). Claim source is untrustworthy (genetic fallacy). No footage would satisfy because conclusion (flat Earth) is predetermined. VISUAL RHETORIC: Beautiful Earth image creates emotional engagement. Starfield background is aesthetically pleasing. Text makes claim seem reasonable without providing evidence it's true. "It's 2016" framing suggests technological capability that should make proof easy. Question format invites viewer to wonder "yeah, why DON'T we have that?" Works if viewer unaware that such footage exists and is publicly available. IRONY: Image literally shows spherical Earth while claiming lack of evidence for spherical Earth. Uses NASA-style Earth imagery to argue NASA doesn't provide real Earth imagery. Makes easily disprovable claim about non-existence of footage that exists. Demonstrates flat Earth community's failure to research before making claims.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-393","title":"Other 393","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12974322_490502564482816_557130847834532251_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-392","title":"Other 392","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12973038_488663814666691_6263949441578117412_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-394","title":"Other 394","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12983414_487024348163971_3915253100816557183_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC CONTENT: This image is particularly harmful because it: 1) EQUATES SPACE EXPLORATION WITH TRAGEDY DENIAL: Groups Apollo moon landing (space achievement) with Sandy Hook (2012 school shooting killing 20 children and 6 adults) and Boston Marathon Bombing (2013 terrorist attack killing 3 and injuring hundreds). Treats denial of real human tragedies as equivalent to space skepticism. 2) SANDY HOOK DENIAL: Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut was real tragedy. 20 first-grade children and 6 staff members were murdered. Conspiracy theories claiming it was "staged" or "hoax" have caused immense additional suffering to grieving families. Families have faced harassment, death threats, and had to move repeatedly due to conspiracy theorists. Alex Jones was sued and found liable for defamation for promoting Sandy Hook denial, resulting in nearly $1.5 billion in damages. 3) BOSTON BOMBING DENIAL: Boston Marathon Bombing on April 15, 2013 killed 3 people and injured over 260. Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified, pursued, and one killed, one captured and later executed. Extensive video evidence, witness testimony, and criminal trial confirmed reality. Denial causes additional pain to victims and survivors. CONSPIRACY THEORY PROGRESSION: Image demonstrates how conspiracy thinking escalates: Starts with relatively "harmless" space skepticism (moon landing denial). Progresses to denial of documented tragedies (mass shootings, terrorist attacks). Creates framework where ANY official narrative can be dismissed as "hoax." Desensitizes believers to dismissing real human suffering. Builds community around shared "forbidden knowledge" regardless of harm caused. FLAT EARTH CONNECTION: While flat Earth and tragedy denial are separate conspiracy theories, they share: Distrust of all official sources. Belief in massive coordinated deception. Community bonding through shared "awakening." Rejection of evidence as fabricated. This image appearing in flat Earth community shows overlap between space denial and broader conspiracy ecosystem. MOON LANDING CLAIMS: Image assumes moon landing was hoax without presenting evidence. Apollo program extensively documented with thousands of photographs, hours of video, hundreds of pounds of moon rocks, scientific experiments still operating today (laser reflectors), independent verification by rival nations (USSR tracked missions), and recent orbital photography of landing sites. MARS MISSION PREDICTION: Image predicts future Mars mission will also be "faked." Implies pattern of space deception will continue. "Wait until" framing suggests upcoming hoax believers should prepare to recognize. Creates unfalsifiable prediction - any future Mars mission will be dismissed as fake regardless of evidence. SCIENTIFIC REALITY: Moon landings: Verified by multiple independent sources including former Soviet Union. Physical evidence (moon rocks) analyzed by scientists worldwide. Retroreflectors placed on Moon still used for laser ranging experiments. Landing sites photographed by multiple nations' lunar orbiters. Sandy Hook: Exhaustively documented tragedy. Death certificates, autopsies, funerals, grieving families, criminal investigation, subsequent legislation. Denying it is not "skepticism" - it's cruelty toward victims' families. Boston Bombing: Captured on multiple surveillance cameras. Perpetrators identified, pursued in televised manhunt, one killed in shootout, one tried and convicted with overwhelming evidence. Survivors with permanent injuries from bombing still alive today. VISUAL RHETORIC: Mars imagery is aspirational/inspirational - appeals to space exploration excitement. Astronauts with flag evokes patriotism and American achievement. Professional-looking rendering suggests legitimacy. Combining appealing visuals with harmful conspiracy text normalizes tragedy denial. Format makes extreme claims seem like reasonable skepticism. HARM CAUSED: Images like this: Spread misinformation about real tragedies. Cause additional trauma to victims' families who encounter denial. Normalize dismissing documented events as "hoaxes." Create pipeline from space skepticism to harmful conspiracy theories. Build communities where any official narrative is suspect. Make it socially acceptable to deny mass casualty events. RESPONSE: This image should be recognized as harmful conspiracy content that: Groups legitimate space skepticism (however misguided) with cruel denial of real tragedies. Causes measurable harm to real people (Sandy Hook families, Boston survivors). Represents escalation of conspiracy thinking into dangerous territory. Should not be normalized or treated as equivalent to other flat Earth content. The families of Sandy Hook victims and Boston bombing survivors deserve better than having their loved ones' deaths dismissed as "media hoaxes."10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 393 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Artistic rendering of Mars landing with astronauts planting American flag, comparing moon landing to Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing as \"media hoaxes\" and warn..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 393"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Artistic rendering of Mars landing with astronauts planting American flag, comparing moon landing to Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing as \"media hoaxes\" and warn..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12974322_490502564482816_557130847834532251_n.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$16"}],"$L17","$L18","$L19","$L1a","$L1b"]
