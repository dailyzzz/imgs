3:T19de,Satirical fake CNN news broadcast claiming NASA discovered Earth's curvature on Mars. Photoshopped parody image mocking search for curvature on wrong planet while claiming Earth is flat. Image designed as fake breaking news broadcast screenshot in style of CNN. Background shows Mars surface photograph - reddish-orange rocky terrain characteristic of Martian landscape. Ground shows rust-colored regolith (dust/rock), scattered rocks and boulders creating rough terrain, distant hills or elevated features creating Martian topography. Lighting suggests Martian sunlight (slightly different color temperature than Earth due to thinner atmosphere, distance from sun). Sky shows peachy-orange glow typical of Mars atmosphere (thin CO2 atmosphere creates different sky color than Earth's blue). Digitally composited onto Mars landscape are two spherical Earth images showing classic "Blue Marble" style views - blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents. Larger Earth sphere positioned prominently in center showing full disk, smaller Earth sphere in upper left connected to larger one by curved red line suggesting magnification or zoom-in relationship (like "this is enlarged view of that"). Both Earth images appear as if photographed from space showing spherical planet. Earth's presence on Mars surface is obviously impossible composite - joke's central visual element. Lower portion shows multiple overlaid text banners in CNN broadcast style. Top banner: Red background with white text "BREAKING NEWS" in all caps - CNN's standard urgent news graphic format. Middle banner: White background with black text in large bold letters "NASA FINDS EARTH'S CURVATURE ON MARS" - headline parodying news format while making absurd claim. CNN logo appears on right side showing "CNN" in white letters on red square background. Right of banner shows initials "JM" possibly indicating image creator. Below that: Black banner with white text "NEW HOPE FOR GLOBE ON MARS" - secondary headline continuing joke that curvature exists but on wrong planet. Bottom banner: Black background with white text showing fake CNN quote: "WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER FIND IT," SAYS NASA - fabricated quote suggesting NASA searched for Earth's curvature unsuccessfully on Earth but finally found it on Mars. Lower left shows "CNN.com" branding. Top left displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution indicating image circulated in flat Earth communities. Satire operates on multiple levels: 1) ABSURDIST HUMOR: Premise is deliberately ridiculous - searching for Earth's curvature on Mars (different planet) while standing on Earth. Parodies flat Earth argument that Earth curvature can't be found/observed, by suggesting it was on Mars all along. 2) MOCKING FLAT EARTHERS: From mainstream perspective, image mocks flat Earth believers for claiming Earth curvature doesn't exist when it's observable from Earth's surface (ships over horizon, high altitude views, different stars at different latitudes). Joke suggests flat Earthers look everywhere except at actual evidence in front of them. 3) ALTERNATIVE READING: From flat Earth perspective, could be read as mocking NASA/mainstream science for showing curved Earth images allegedly from space but never showing curvature from ground level on Earth itself. Suggests curvature only appears in NASA's Mars photos (and Earth photos from space) but not observable in reality. 4) "BREAKING NEWS" PARODY: Format parodies 24-hour news cycle's breathless coverage of minor stories. CNN's "breaking news" banner appears so frequently it's become subject of mockery. Using dramatic "breaking news" format for absurd non-story emphasizes ridiculousness. 5) QUOTE PARODY: Fake NASA quote "We thought we'd never find it" suggests organization desperately searching for proof of curvature, failing to find it on Earth (from flat Earth perspective - admitting curvature doesn't exist on Earth), but eventually finding it on Mars (wrong planet). However, curvature is easily observable on Earth: Ships disappear hull-first over ocean horizon (visible with binoculars from beach), horizon distance increases with observer altitude (calculate: distance = √(2 × Earth radius × height)), different star constellations visible from different latitudes (Southern Cross visible in Southern Hemisphere, Polaris visible in Northern Hemisphere), time zones result from spherical rotation, seasons result from axial tilt of sphere, Foucault pendulum demonstrates rotation, Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns. High-altitude observations show curvature: Commercial aircraft at 35,000+ feet show subtle horizon curve, high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curvature, Felix Baumgartner's 2012 Red Bull Stratos jump from 128,000 feet showed clear curvature, astronauts on ISS see obvious curvature from 250-mile altitude. Mars observations actually confirm spherical planets: Mars rovers photograph Martian horizon showing curve consistent with 2,106-mile radius sphere, Mars orbiters show planet is spherical like Earth, Phobos and Deimos (Mars moons) are visible from Mars surface behaving according to spherical planet orbital mechanics. Image's effectiveness as satire depends on viewer: Mainstream viewers see absurdist humor mocking flat Earth's denial of obvious evidence. Flat Earth believers might interpret as mocking NASA's reliance on space imagery while claiming ground observations show flatness. Photoshop quality is intentional parody - CNN broadcast graphics combined with Mars rover imagery and Earth photos creates obviously fake composite. Not attempting to deceive but rather create humorous mashup commenting on flat Earth debate. CNN logo usage is parody/satire (fair use) not actual CNN broadcast. Format became popular meme template for creating fake news screenshots on various topics. This specific version circulated in flat Earth communities as both self-deprecating humor and critique of mainstream science. Context: Mars has been subject of flat Earth speculation - some flat Earthers question whether Mars missions are real or filmed on Earth (Devon Island, Canada often cited as fake Mars location). Others accept Mars exists but debate its nature/distance. Image plays on these debates while highlighting central contradiction: if Earth photos from space show curve, why doesn't Mars? Answer: both planets are spherical, observable from space and detectable from surface observations. Satire highlights flat Earth movement's selective acceptance of evidence - accepting Mars rover photos showing Martian landscape while rejecting similar Earth photos from orbit.4:T16fe,Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet using ironic wordplay "around the globe" about flat Earth movement. Screenshot of authentic Twitter post from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson making witty observation about flat Earth movement's growth. Image shows standard Twitter interface with white background. Top left displays Tyson's profile photo - headshot showing him in dark suit with characteristic mustache and goatee, friendly expression. Next to photo shows verified Twitter account information: "Neil deGrasse Tyson" in bold black text with blue checkmark verification badge indicating authentic account. Below name shows Twitter handle "@neiltyson" in gray text. Tweet body contains single sentence in standard Twitter font (black text on white background): "I hear that the flat-Earth movement may be gaining momentum all around the globe." Tweet intentionally uses phrase "around the globe" when discussing flat Earth movement - creates ironic wordplay since flat Earth believers claim Earth is not globe. Humor lies in contradiction: if discussing flat Earth movement, why use globe terminology? Either slip revealing Tyson's globe Earth assumption, or deliberate joke poking fun at movement. Timestamp below tweet shows "10:44 AM - 8 Mar 2016" in gray text indicating when tweet was posted. Engagement metrics displayed below in gray and black text: "10,027 RETWEETS" and "23,881 LIKES" showing tweet's popularity and viral spread. Top right shows Twitter bird logo with plus sign for following/interaction. Bottom right displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution in black text on white background, indicating screenshot shared in flat Earth community. Tweet operates on multiple levels: 1) WORDPLAY: "Around the globe" is common English idiom meaning "worldwide" or "everywhere," but literal meaning references spherical Earth. Using this phrase when discussing flat Earth movement creates humorous contradiction. 2) TYSON'S INTENT: Tweet likely intended as gentle mockery - Tyson using globe terminology sarcastically implies flat Earth believers are spreading movement across spherical Earth without realizing irony. Shows Tyson's dismissive attitude toward flat Earth claims through subtle humor rather than direct confrontation. 3) SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Tyson is prominent science communicator, astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of Cosmos reboot. He frequently addresses pseudoscience and scientific misconceptions. Flat Earth movement began gaining internet visibility around 2014-2016 through YouTube videos, social media, leading to Tyson's 2016 observation about movement's growth. 4) "GAINING MOMENTUM": Physics pun - momentum is physics term (mass × velocity), fitting for physicist discussing movement. Also means "gaining traction" or "growing in popularity." Double meaning adds layer to wordplay. Flat Earth community's reaction to tweet likely mixed: Some might appreciate being acknowledged by prominent scientist (any attention is validation). Others might cite it as evidence establishment feels threatened by flat Earth truth spreading. Screenshot shared in flat Earth communities (fb.com/fematters attribution) suggests tweet used as evidence movement is significant enough to warrant mainstream science's attention. However, Tyson's tone is clearly mocking rather than legitimizing. Tweet reflects 2016 moment when flat Earth experienced resurgence via social media after being dormant for decades. Modern flat Earth movement primarily online phenomenon, using YouTube, Facebook, Twitter to spread despite contradicting centuries of established science. Movement gained enough visibility that prominent scientists felt compelled to address it, though usually dismissively. Irony of wordplay works because "around the globe" is so embedded in common speech that even when discussing alternative Earth shapes, globe terminology naturally emerges. This linguistic habit reflects how thoroughly spherical Earth understanding is integrated into human culture and language - countless idioms, phrases, concepts built on sphericity assumption. Scientific evidence for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different star constellations visible from different hemispheres, time zones, seasons from axial tilt, Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect, satellite imagery from multiple nations, circumnavigation, GPS systems requiring orbital mechanics, lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, measurements by ancient Greeks (Eratosthenes calculating circumference 240 BCE). Tweet became popular in both mainstream and flat Earth communities - mainstream appreciates clever wordplay and Tyson's wit, flat Earth community uses it as evidence their movement is growing and gaining establishment attention. Screenshot format allows viral spread beyond Twitter, appearing on Facebook, forums, memes. Tweet exemplifies science communication challenge: how to address pseudoscience without amplifying it. Tyson chose humor/mockery approach rather than detailed rebuttal. However, research shows mockery can backfire by creating persecution complex in believers, reinforcing sense they're brave truth-seekers against hostile establishment. Alternative interpretation: Tweet could be read as Tyson acknowledging flat Earth is spreading worldwide (unintentionally giving movement credibility), but wordplay suggests dismissive rather than concerned tone. Context of Tyson's other work (numerous talks, tweets, videos defending spherical Earth, explaining basic astronomy) makes clear his position: Earth is spherical, flat Earth belief represents scientific illiteracy, movement's growth is concerning but ultimately contradicts overwhelming evidence. Tweet received significant engagement (10k retweets, 23k likes) showing topic's viral potential and public interest in flat Earth controversy as curiosity/entertainment rather than serious debate.5:T1fb9,Four rocket launch time-lapse photographs showing parabolic trajectories questioning space travel authenticity. Compilation of long-exposure launch photos arranged in 2×2 grid with text suggesting rockets don't reach space but follow ballistic arcs returning to Earth. Image argues rocket trajectories prove space travel is impossible or faked. Top row shows two photographs of rocket launches captured with long exposure creating glowing trail across sky. Top left: Nighttime launch from coastal location showing rocket ascending from horizon/launchpad creating bright orange-yellow streak arcing across dark sky. Launch trail starts at horizon on left, curves upward and right creating parabolic arc across frame. Rocket exhaust illuminated creating glowing path. Multiple faint parallel streaks visible (possibly other objects or earlier rocket stages). Background shows body of water (ocean or large lake) reflecting lights, dark shoreline silhouette visible at bottom. Sky shows few stars visible through atmospheric glow. Top right: Twilight or dawn launch showing similar parabolic trajectory. Rocket trail starts from lower left creating bright orange-yellow glowing arc across sky reaching peak in upper right portion before appearing to descend toward right side of frame. Background shows dramatic twilight sky with blue-purple gradient at horizon transitioning to darker blue above, scattered orange-tinted clouds illuminated by setting/rising sun or rocket exhaust. Launch appears to originate over water or flat terrain. Trail shows characteristic brightness and glow from rocket exhaust catching sunlight or creating own illumination. Bottom row shows two similar launch photographs. Bottom left: Dark night launch showing rocket trail as white-orange glowing arc from lower left ascending to upper center then appearing to curve back down toward right. Trajectory creates nearly complete parabolic arc suggesting rocket reaches peak altitude then descends. Dark sky background with few stars visible. Silhouetted structure visible in lower right (possibly launch tower, building, or vegetation). Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Bottom right: Launch during golden hour or sunset showing rocket trail as brilliant orange-yellow streak against gray overcast sky. Trail starts from lower center-left, arcs upward to upper right quadrant, then appears to curve back down. Foreground shows silhouetted vegetation (tall grass or reeds) creating dark shapes against lighter sky. Orange-brown clouds visible in background. Lighting suggests sun near horizon creating dramatic atmospheric conditions. Text overlays span top and bottom of image in large bold white letters with black outline. Top text: "TIME LAPSE OF ROCKETS ARE RATHER TELLING DON'T YOU THINK?" posing rhetorical question suggesting images reveal truth about rocket trajectories. Bottom text: "THEY GO UP & COME BACK DOWN" stating conclusion that rockets follow ballistic paths (up then down) rather than escaping to space. Meme's argument: Long-exposure rocket launch photos show parabolic trajectories - rockets ascend, reach peak, then descend back to Earth. This supposedly proves rockets don't reach orbit or escape Earth, but instead follow ballistic arcs like thrown objects, landing back on Earth (possibly in ocean). Suggests space travel is impossible and rockets are just expensive fireworks that fall back down. However, argument misinterprets what time-lapse photos show and misunderstands orbital mechanics: 1) PERSPECTIVE AND VIEWING ANGLE: All four photos show launches viewed from ground relatively close to launch site (within tens of miles). Observer sees rocket ascend, then disappear over horizon or due to distance, creating appearance of "coming back down" in frame. What looks like descent is actually rocket continuing horizontal acceleration while vertical component decreases, combined with Earth's curvature taking rocket over horizon and out of view. 2) MULTI-STAGE ROCKETS: Modern orbital rockets use staging - first stage burns for few minutes lifting rocket through dense atmosphere, then separates and falls back to Earth (sometimes landing on droneships for reuse - SpaceX Falcon 9). Second stage continues firing, delivering payload to orbit. Time-lapse showing "ascending then descending" trail might show first stage separation and return while second stage (no longer visible/creating exhaust trail) continues to orbit. 3) EXPOSURE TIME: Long exposures capture several minutes of flight. During this time, rocket transitions from vertical ascent to gravity turn - gradually pitching over toward horizontal to gain orbital velocity. Orbital insertion requires horizontal velocity (17,500 mph for low Earth orbit), not vertical altitude. Rocket appears to "come back down" because it's transitioning to horizontal flight path (orbital trajectory is parallel to Earth's surface), not because it's falling. 4) LIGHTING: Rocket exhaust visible when illuminated - during night launch or twilight when sun angle allows. Once rocket reaches high altitude or moves away from sun angle, exhaust trail becomes invisible even though rocket continues firing. What appears as trail "ending" or "coming down" is actually trail becoming invisible while rocket continues upward/horizontally to orbit. 5) DISTANCE AND RESOLUTION: After few minutes of flight, rocket is dozens or hundreds of miles away from camera, making it too small/dim to see, even if still ascending. Trail "ends" not because rocket stopped but because it's too far away to photograph. Evidence rockets reach space: Satellites remain in orbit for years (GPS, communications, weather, ISS), ground stations track satellites showing consistent orbital paths, amateur radio operators communicate with ISS passing overhead, satellite passes visible to naked eye at predictable times (ISS, Starlink trains, Iridium flares), astronauts from multiple nations report weightlessness and Earth views from orbit, telemetry data from missions shows orbital velocities and altitudes, spent rocket stages tracked in orbit by space surveillance networks, some first stages recovered and reused (SpaceX) confirming staging works as described. Parabolic appearance is optical illusion of perspective: Ballistic trajectory (object thrown upward) is parabola in vertical plane. Orbital trajectory is ellipse (or circle) in horizontal plane around Earth. From ground observer's perspective, rocket transitioning from vertical ascent to horizontal orbital insertion appears parabolic even though actual trajectory is orbital ellipse. Time-lapse photos can't distinguish between ballistic arc and orbital trajectory without altitude/velocity data. Meme suggests: "images prove rockets come back down." Reality: images show partial trajectory from one viewing angle during first minutes of multi-stage launch. Doesn't show: orbital insertion burn, second stage performance, satellite deployment, orbital mechanics. Comparing rocket launch to ballistic trajectory misses fundamental difference: ballistic object has single velocity impulse (thrown/fired), orbital rocket continuously thrusts for 8-10 minutes, accelerating to orbital velocity. Four photos show different missions (different locations, times, rocket types) but meme treats them as representative of all launches, ignoring thousands of successful orbital missions documented over 60+ years of space age. Flat Earth perspective often conflates atmosphere/space boundary, suggests space doesn't exist or is unreachable. However, space is simply region beyond Earth's atmosphere (Kármán line at 62 miles altitude). Rockets routinely exceed this. ISS orbits at 250 miles. Moon is 238,000 miles. Definitions and distances are measurable, verified by multiple independent sources worldwide. Rhetorical question "don't you think?" appeals to intuition over evidence. Suggests images are self-evident proof requiring no explanation. But understanding orbital mechanics, perspective, photography techniques reveals images consistent with successful space launches, not evidence against them.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-362","title":"Other 362","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12823526_474892529377153_5951790268764708560_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-361","title":"Other 361","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12823387_472799826253090_255734087457504518_o.png","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-363","title":"Other 363","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12828564_473024222897317_3882576608713289195_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
