5:T19de,Satirical fake CNN news broadcast claiming NASA discovered Earth's curvature on Mars. Photoshopped parody image mocking search for curvature on wrong planet while claiming Earth is flat. Image designed as fake breaking news broadcast screenshot in style of CNN. Background shows Mars surface photograph - reddish-orange rocky terrain characteristic of Martian landscape. Ground shows rust-colored regolith (dust/rock), scattered rocks and boulders creating rough terrain, distant hills or elevated features creating Martian topography. Lighting suggests Martian sunlight (slightly different color temperature than Earth due to thinner atmosphere, distance from sun). Sky shows peachy-orange glow typical of Mars atmosphere (thin CO2 atmosphere creates different sky color than Earth's blue). Digitally composited onto Mars landscape are two spherical Earth images showing classic "Blue Marble" style views - blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents. Larger Earth sphere positioned prominently in center showing full disk, smaller Earth sphere in upper left connected to larger one by curved red line suggesting magnification or zoom-in relationship (like "this is enlarged view of that"). Both Earth images appear as if photographed from space showing spherical planet. Earth's presence on Mars surface is obviously impossible composite - joke's central visual element. Lower portion shows multiple overlaid text banners in CNN broadcast style. Top banner: Red background with white text "BREAKING NEWS" in all caps - CNN's standard urgent news graphic format. Middle banner: White background with black text in large bold letters "NASA FINDS EARTH'S CURVATURE ON MARS" - headline parodying news format while making absurd claim. CNN logo appears on right side showing "CNN" in white letters on red square background. Right of banner shows initials "JM" possibly indicating image creator. Below that: Black banner with white text "NEW HOPE FOR GLOBE ON MARS" - secondary headline continuing joke that curvature exists but on wrong planet. Bottom banner: Black background with white text showing fake CNN quote: "WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER FIND IT," SAYS NASA - fabricated quote suggesting NASA searched for Earth's curvature unsuccessfully on Earth but finally found it on Mars. Lower left shows "CNN.com" branding. Top left displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution indicating image circulated in flat Earth communities. Satire operates on multiple levels: 1) ABSURDIST HUMOR: Premise is deliberately ridiculous - searching for Earth's curvature on Mars (different planet) while standing on Earth. Parodies flat Earth argument that Earth curvature can't be found/observed, by suggesting it was on Mars all along. 2) MOCKING FLAT EARTHERS: From mainstream perspective, image mocks flat Earth believers for claiming Earth curvature doesn't exist when it's observable from Earth's surface (ships over horizon, high altitude views, different stars at different latitudes). Joke suggests flat Earthers look everywhere except at actual evidence in front of them. 3) ALTERNATIVE READING: From flat Earth perspective, could be read as mocking NASA/mainstream science for showing curved Earth images allegedly from space but never showing curvature from ground level on Earth itself. Suggests curvature only appears in NASA's Mars photos (and Earth photos from space) but not observable in reality. 4) "BREAKING NEWS" PARODY: Format parodies 24-hour news cycle's breathless coverage of minor stories. CNN's "breaking news" banner appears so frequently it's become subject of mockery. Using dramatic "breaking news" format for absurd non-story emphasizes ridiculousness. 5) QUOTE PARODY: Fake NASA quote "We thought we'd never find it" suggests organization desperately searching for proof of curvature, failing to find it on Earth (from flat Earth perspective - admitting curvature doesn't exist on Earth), but eventually finding it on Mars (wrong planet). However, curvature is easily observable on Earth: Ships disappear hull-first over ocean horizon (visible with binoculars from beach), horizon distance increases with observer altitude (calculate: distance = √(2 × Earth radius × height)), different star constellations visible from different latitudes (Southern Cross visible in Southern Hemisphere, Polaris visible in Northern Hemisphere), time zones result from spherical rotation, seasons result from axial tilt of sphere, Foucault pendulum demonstrates rotation, Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns. High-altitude observations show curvature: Commercial aircraft at 35,000+ feet show subtle horizon curve, high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curvature, Felix Baumgartner's 2012 Red Bull Stratos jump from 128,000 feet showed clear curvature, astronauts on ISS see obvious curvature from 250-mile altitude. Mars observations actually confirm spherical planets: Mars rovers photograph Martian horizon showing curve consistent with 2,106-mile radius sphere, Mars orbiters show planet is spherical like Earth, Phobos and Deimos (Mars moons) are visible from Mars surface behaving according to spherical planet orbital mechanics. Image's effectiveness as satire depends on viewer: Mainstream viewers see absurdist humor mocking flat Earth's denial of obvious evidence. Flat Earth believers might interpret as mocking NASA's reliance on space imagery while claiming ground observations show flatness. Photoshop quality is intentional parody - CNN broadcast graphics combined with Mars rover imagery and Earth photos creates obviously fake composite. Not attempting to deceive but rather create humorous mashup commenting on flat Earth debate. CNN logo usage is parody/satire (fair use) not actual CNN broadcast. Format became popular meme template for creating fake news screenshots on various topics. This specific version circulated in flat Earth communities as both self-deprecating humor and critique of mainstream science. Context: Mars has been subject of flat Earth speculation - some flat Earthers question whether Mars missions are real or filmed on Earth (Devon Island, Canada often cited as fake Mars location). Others accept Mars exists but debate its nature/distance. Image plays on these debates while highlighting central contradiction: if Earth photos from space show curve, why doesn't Mars? Answer: both planets are spherical, observable from space and detectable from surface observations. Satire highlights flat Earth movement's selective acceptance of evidence - accepting Mars rover photos showing Martian landscape while rejecting similar Earth photos from orbit.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 362 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Satirical fake CNN news broadcast claiming NASA discovered Earth's curvature on Mars.
