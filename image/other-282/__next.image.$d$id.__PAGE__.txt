3:T825,Flat Earth cosmology azimuthal equidistant projection labeled as United Nations map. Artistic rendering of world map using azimuthal equidistant projection viewed from North Pole perspective. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central image shows circular map on light background (appears like marble or textured white surface) surrounded by thin black double-line border frame. Map displays Earth's continents arranged radially from center point (North Pole shown as white circle with radiating lines). Continents shown in natural colors: green for vegetation/landmasses, tan/beige for deserts, white for ice/snow (Antarctica and Greenland). Oceans in gradient turquoise-teal-blue getting darker toward outer edge. North Pole at dead center with Arctic Ocean and Greenland visible. Moving outward clockwise from top: Asia (Russia, China, Japan visible in tan-green), Africa (shown in tan-brown tones), Europe (small green landmass), North America (green, stretching along right side), South America (green-tan on lower right), Australia (visible as isolated landmass in green-tan), various Pacific islands scattered throughout ocean. Concentric circles and radial lines create latitude/longitude grid system. Small yellow dots appear at regular intervals around continents possibly representing cities or coordinate markers. Map edges fade into lighter background suggesting atmosphere or boundary. Bottom text on beige border: 'UNITED NATIONS MAP'. Projection is legitimate cartographic tool (official UN emblem uses it) designed to show accurate distances from center point - useful for radio communications, aviation planning from specific location. However, severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center. Antarctica appears as ring around entire perimeter (in reality it's continent smaller than South America). Australia and South America appear enormous. This projection does NOT prove flat Earth - it's mathematical transformation of spherical surface to 2D plane, like Mercator projection. All map projections involve distortion trade-offs4:T832,Ken Jeong angry teacher meme about flat Earth researchers. Popular meme format using actor Ken Jeong's character Mr. Chow or similar role showing exaggerated frustration. Image shows Asian man (appears to be Ken Jeong) in classroom setting wearing maroon/burgundy shirt. He has intense angry expression with eyes squinted shut, mouth open yelling, eyebrows furrowed in frustration. Right hand raised to side of head holding small white piece of paper or note in pinched fingers. Expression suggests extreme exasperation or rage. Background shows blurred green chalkboard/blackboard suggesting classroom or teaching environment. Body language indicates theatrical overreaction to something said. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO RESEARCH FLAT EARTH'. Center-right shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text: 'BEFORE THEY GET UPSET AND START TELLING ME I'M WRONG'. Meme format typically used for 'Here's a list of people who...' jokes where list is very short (single small paper) or nonexistent. In this context, suggests flat Earthers get immediately defensive when their beliefs challenged, refusing to accept contrary evidence. Implies flat Earth believers haven't actually researched topic before committing to belief - they became emotionally invested first, then get angry when contradicted rather than examining evidence objectively. Common criticism of conspiracy theorists: strong emotional reactions to challenges rather than calm logical discourse. However, many flat Earthers claim extensive research led them to conclusion - countless YouTube videos, forums, books, experiments (though often flawed methodology or confirmation bias). Meme captures frustration of debunkers who present evidence (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, time zones, seasons, circumnavigation, satellite communications) only to face angry dismissal rather than rational discussion. Ken Jeong's over-the-top expression amplifies comedic effect suggesting disproportionate emotional response to simple facts5:T79d,Flat Earth cosmology sun diagram with colored orbital circles. Minimalist educational diagram showing sun in flat Earth model with symbolic colored circles. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Central illustration on solid black background shows large pale yellow-cream circle representing sun in center. Sun rendered as perfect sphere with subtle gradient from bright yellow-white at center to slightly darker cream at edges suggesting luminosity. Around central sun positioned six smaller solid-colored circles arranged roughly in circular pattern but not perfectly symmetrical: Upper center shows deep blue/navy circle. Upper left shows teal/cyan circle. Left side shows forest green circle. Lower center shows bright yellow circle (slightly smaller than sun but similar color). Right side shows orange-amber circle. Upper right shows dark red/maroon circle. Circles appear to float in space around sun on black background. No connecting lines, orbits, labels, or explanatory text visible besides title. Spacing between circles irregular - not precise orbital diagram. Bottom text on beige border: 'THE SUN'. Minimalist aesthetic with vintage poster feel from beige border and simple color palette. Diagram purpose unclear without labels - colored circles might represent: 1) Planets in flat Earth model orbiting sun (though flat Earth models typically have sun orbiting above Earth plane, not other planets orbiting sun), 2) Different wavelengths/colors of light emitted by sun (but why only 6 discrete colors?), 3) Symbolic representation of sun's influence or energy at different positions, 4) Purely decorative artistic interpretation. Standard flat Earth cosmology has small local sun (32-50 miles diameter, 3000-5000 miles altitude) circling above stationary Earth plane creating day/night through proximity/distance. This diagram's meaning ambiguous without context. Artistic style mimics vintage scientific illustrations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-282","title":"Other 282","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729232_464902337042839_4150015327768630377_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-281","title":"Other 281","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729190_465943886938684_6995591824522989875_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-283","title":"Other 283","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12729356_464902073709532_6940837958255985229_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
