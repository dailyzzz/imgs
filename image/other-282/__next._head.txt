5:T825,Flat Earth cosmology azimuthal equidistant projection labeled as United Nations map. Artistic rendering of world map using azimuthal equidistant projection viewed from North Pole perspective. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central image shows circular map on light background (appears like marble or textured white surface) surrounded by thin black double-line border frame. Map displays Earth's continents arranged radially from center point (North Pole shown as white circle with radiating lines). Continents shown in natural colors: green for vegetation/landmasses, tan/beige for deserts, white for ice/snow (Antarctica and Greenland). Oceans in gradient turquoise-teal-blue getting darker toward outer edge. North Pole at dead center with Arctic Ocean and Greenland visible. Moving outward clockwise from top: Asia (Russia, China, Japan visible in tan-green), Africa (shown in tan-brown tones), Europe (small green landmass), North America (green, stretching along right side), South America (green-tan on lower right), Australia (visible as isolated landmass in green-tan), various Pacific islands scattered throughout ocean. Concentric circles and radial lines create latitude/longitude grid system. Small yellow dots appear at regular intervals around continents possibly representing cities or coordinate markers. Map edges fade into lighter background suggesting atmosphere or boundary. Bottom text on beige border: 'UNITED NATIONS MAP'. Projection is legitimate cartographic tool (official UN emblem uses it) designed to show accurate distances from center point - useful for radio communications, aviation planning from specific location. However, severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center. Antarctica appears as ring around entire perimeter (in reality it's continent smaller than South America). Australia and South America appear enormous. This projection does NOT prove flat Earth - it's mathematical transformation of spherical surface to 2D plane, like Mercator projection. All map projections involve distortion trade-offs0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 282 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth cosmology azimuthal equidistant projection labeled as United Nations map.
