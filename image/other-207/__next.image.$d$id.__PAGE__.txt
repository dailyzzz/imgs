3:T562,Brian Williams meme mocking false reporting scandal applied to moon landing. Shows Brian Williams, American news anchor, sitting at NBC Nightly News desk in professional broadcast setting. Williams wears dark navy blue suit jacket, white dress shirt, lavender/light purple tie with small pattern. Has salt-and-pepper gray-brown hair neatly styled, clean-shaven face with serious neutral news anchor expression looking directly at camera. Background shows blurred multicolored lights creating typical newsroom aesthetic - green, orange, yellow bokeh lights suggesting monitors and studio equipment. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE MOON LANDING WAS NOT A HOAX'. Bottom text in similar style: 'I WAS THERE'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Parodies Brian Williams' 2015 scandal where he falsely claimed to have been in helicopter hit by RPG fire in Iraq War, forcing him to suspend from NBC Nightly News. Williams was caught fabricating or embellishing multiple stories throughout his career, damaging credibility of mainstream news media. Meme applies his pattern of false claims to moon landing, sarcastically suggesting if Williams vouches for it, that itself proves it's fake. Uses Williams' discredited credibility to undermine trust in moon landing narrative and mainstream media's authority to verify historical events4:T57d,Aerial cloudscape photograph with flat Earth mission statement overlay. Shows breathtaking high-altitude view above cloud layer. Dark blue gradient sky at top transitioning to lighter blue at horizon. Bright white sun visible in upper right with dramatic lens flare and radiating light beams. Thick layer of white-gray puffy cumulus clouds fills middle and lower portion creating soft cotton-like texture. Clouds show depth and dimension with shadows and highlights. Snow-covered mountain peaks barely visible poking through clouds in center-left area showing tan-brown rocky surfaces. Atmospheric haze creates layers of depth. Top left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Large white text spans top: 'We Are Not Here to Convert,' Bold white text with black outline at bottom: 'WE ARE HERE TO OPEN MINDS'. Bottom right corner shows 'JM' signature watermark. Message emphasizes flat Earth community's stated goal is not religious-style conversion but encouraging independent critical thinking and questioning official narratives. Suggests movement is about intellectual freedom and breaking out of indoctrination rather than forcing beliefs on others. Inspirational tone with majestic nature photography implies truth-seeking and higher perspective. Responds to criticism that flat Earth proponents are dogmatic by framing their mission as enlightenment and consciousness-raising5:T647,Leonardo da Vinci quote about perception over sunset cliff landscape. Shows dramatic scenic photograph of person standing on rocky cliff edge at golden hour sunset. Person appears as dark silhouette wearing casual clothes (jacket, pants) standing with legs apart on prominent rock outcropping left side of frame. Large rocky cliff face or boulder visible on left edge. Foreground shows brown-gray rocky terrain with some sparse vegetation (grass, small bushes). Middle-ground stretches into hazy distant valley or plains area. Sky dominates upper two-thirds showing spectacular sunset - layers of clouds in purple-gray, pink, orange, and peachy tones. Bright yellow-orange sun disk visible on horizon right of center, slightly above horizon line. Warm golden-orange glow illuminates clouds from below. Top portion shows white text: 'There are three classes of people: Those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.' Attribution below: '— Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in light gray translucent text. Quote attributed to Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci suggests hierarchy of perception and understanding. Flat Earth proponents interpret themselves as 'those who see' - able to perceive truth without being shown. Mainstream believers are 'those who see when shown' - require authority to point out reality. Globe Earth believers are 'those who do not see' - refuse truth even when presented with evidence. Inspirational framing with person gazing at horizon suggests enlightenment, truth-seeking, and seeing beyond illusions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-207","title":"Other 207","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12622452_455815857951487_7964728843184783428_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-206","title":"Other 206","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12622168_457635647769508_3543287874816915632_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-208","title":"Other 208","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633498_458496047683468_3694862073385235037_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
