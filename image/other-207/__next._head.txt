5:T562,Brian Williams meme mocking false reporting scandal applied to moon landing. Shows Brian Williams, American news anchor, sitting at NBC Nightly News desk in professional broadcast setting. Williams wears dark navy blue suit jacket, white dress shirt, lavender/light purple tie with small pattern. Has salt-and-pepper gray-brown hair neatly styled, clean-shaven face with serious neutral news anchor expression looking directly at camera. Background shows blurred multicolored lights creating typical newsroom aesthetic - green, orange, yellow bokeh lights suggesting monitors and studio equipment. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE MOON LANDING WAS NOT A HOAX'. Bottom text in similar style: 'I WAS THERE'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Parodies Brian Williams' 2015 scandal where he falsely claimed to have been in helicopter hit by RPG fire in Iraq War, forcing him to suspend from NBC Nightly News. Williams was caught fabricating or embellishing multiple stories throughout his career, damaging credibility of mainstream news media. Meme applies his pattern of false claims to moon landing, sarcastically suggesting if Williams vouches for it, that itself proves it's fake. Uses Williams' discredited credibility to undermine trust in moon landing narrative and mainstream media's authority to verify historical events0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 207 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Brian Williams meme mocking false reporting scandal applied to moon landing.
