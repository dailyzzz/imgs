13:T5d1,Ocean sunset with flat horizon featuring Side-Eye Chloe meme. Shows dramatic seascape photograph at sunset over ocean or large body of water. Sky dominates image with spectacular cloud formations in layered horizontal bands. Top shows thick dark orange-brown clouds with textured undersides. Middle section displays golden-yellow illuminated clouds catching sunlight. Lower atmosphere shows gradient from bright orange-yellow to deep red-orange near horizon. Brilliant yellow-orange sun sits at horizon line appearing as perfect semi-circle half-submerged below water's edge. Sun creates bright golden reflection path across water surface. Water shows dark blue-black in foreground transitioning to red-orange reflections in middle distance. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and straight across entire width of image where water meets sky. Upper text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SILLY BALLERS "BELIEVE" WE ARE SEEING THE CURVE OF THE EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' in yellow text. Lower section displays white text: 'AT SEA LEVEL'. Lower right corner features small image of young blonde girl (Side-Eye Chloe meme - Chloe Clem viral photo from 2013) in purple jacket giving skeptical sideways glance with raised eyebrow, expressing doubt. Meme mocks 'ball Earthers' who claim to see Earth's curvature at sea level. Flat horizon used as evidence against spherical Earth. Side-Eye Chloe's skeptical expression reinforces ridicule toward mainstream belief14:T5f3,Globe Earth on textbooks contrasting education versus indoctrination. Shows artistic still life photograph on wooden surface against black background. Center displays small desktop globe (approximately 4-6 inches diameter) showing realistic Earth with blue oceans, green-brown continents (North and South America visible), white cloud patterns. Globe sits atop green hardcover book with black embossed text reading 'EDUCATION'. Behind and around are stacked various academic textbooks in multiple colors - visible spines show subjects including 'BIOLOGY', 'SOCIAL STUDIES', 'GEOGRAPHY', 'POLITICS', 'HISTORY', 'COMPUTERS', 'ENGLISH', 'SPORTS', 'DESIGN', 'PHYSIOLOGY' in different colored bindings (green, blue, tan, yellow, pink, white). Books stacked at angles creating academic library aesthetic. Left side shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark in white text. Top text in large white bold letters: 'THIS IS NOT EDUCATION'. Bottom text: 'THIS IS INDOCTRINATION'. Image argues that teaching globe Earth model through academic curriculum represents indoctrination rather than genuine education. Claims educational system presents globe as unquestionable fact across all subjects - geography, history, politics, science - creating reinforcement through repetition. Suggests true education would encourage questioning and independent investigation rather than accepting authoritative claims. Globe literally positioned on foundation labeled 'education' symbolizes how worldview is built into institutional learning from childhood15:T629,Historical text excerpt claiming globe Earth as recent innovation. Shows photograph of aged printed page with tan-beige paper showing brown staining, wear, and aging. Text appears in traditional serif typeface suggesting old book or document. Visible header reads 'preparation for' followed by 'THE GLOBES' as section title. Main paragraph text states: 'A short time ago one of the Brethren questioned the adaptation of the balls to use for globes representing the terrestrial and celestial firmaments. He pointed out that it is only a matter of a few hundred years since everyone believed that the earth was flat! This is quite true, and this idea is quite a modern innovation. Except to a few profound thinkers such as Plato, the conception of the earth as a sphere was utterly foreign.' Gray watermark across text reads 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Text appears to be from religious or educational publication discussing history of cosmological models. Passage acknowledges flat Earth was universal belief until recently (few hundred years ago), then claims spherical Earth concept is 'modern innovation'. States only rare philosophers like Plato conceived of spherical Earth, implying it was alien to common understanding. Flat Earth proponents share this to argue globe model is recent invention rather than ancient knowledge. However, spherical Earth was established by ancient Greeks around 500 BCE, with Eratosthenes calculating circumference in 240 BCE. Medieval scholars also accepted spherical Earth. Passage reflects common misconception about flat Earth belief in history9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-239","title":"Other 239","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671748_484313121768427_7361555279972798088_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-238","title":"Other 238","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12670796_472678899598516_3721156154901980101_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-240","title":"Other 240","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12671813_467779710088435_4298974868270770621_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
