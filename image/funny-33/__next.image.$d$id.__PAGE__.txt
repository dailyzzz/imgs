Top text reads 'I JUST SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY ON CHRISTMAS PRESENTS'. Bottom text completes thought: 'BY TALKING ABOUT FLAT EARTH WITH MY RELATIVES'. Humorous take on social consequences of discussing flat Earth theory at family gatherings, suggesting controversial topic acts as natural family distance-creator, reducing gift exchange obligations. Classic Kermit tea-sipping meme format used for passive-aggressive observations"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-32","title":"Funny 32","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/61620851_448649322376548_7413609930856333312_n.jpeg","description":"Where's Waldo parody meme featuring densely crowded beach scene with hundreds of illustrated people in swimsuits on yellow sand and in blue water. Sailboat, lifeguard stand, beach umbrellas, swimmers, sunbathers visible throughout extremely detailed illustration in classic Waldo art style. Top text reads 'FUCK WALDO' (profane dismissal of original search objective). Bottom text asks 'WHERE'S THE CURVATURE?' Clever subversion of 'Where's Waldo' concept, challenging viewers to find Earth's curvature in horizon line instead of hidden character. Horizon appears perfectly flat across ocean scene"},"nextImage":{"id":"funny-34","title":"Funny 34","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/81492424_3625765507441247_3417324491800313856_n.jpeg","description":"Cat in pet carrier meme showing white cat with black patches standing upright inside black wire pet crate, appearing to grip bars with front paws in prison-like pose. Top text reads 'WHEN YOU BRING A CAT' and bottom text states 'FROM AUSTRALIA TO EUROPE...' Humorous visual joke about gravity and cat orientation when traveling from 'upside down' Australia to 'right side up' Europe on spherical Earth. Cat's upright posture suggests it would remain oriented to Australian 'down' direction, arriving standing upside down in European reference frame. Satirizes gravity confusion between hemispheres"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
