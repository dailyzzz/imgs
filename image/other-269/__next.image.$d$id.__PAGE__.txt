3:T7d2,High altitude curved horizon photograph conversion story meme. Two-panel meme describing flat Earth conversion moment. Top text in large bold white letters: 'HOW DID I BECOME A FLAT EARTHER?'. Main image shows spectacular high-altitude photograph taken from aircraft or weather balloon. View looks across curved horizon showing Earth's curvature. Upper portion displays dark gradient sky transitioning from nearly black space at top through deep blue, then lighter blue closer to horizon. Stars visible as white specks in darkest regions suggesting very high altitude (possibly 60,000+ feet or lower stratosphere). Horizon shows subtle but definite curve spanning width of image. Below horizon line visible cloud formations or terrain features - lighter tan/beige coloring with blue-gray atmospheric layers. Reflection or bright area visible on surface possibly from sun glare on water or clouds. Right side shows slight pinkish-purple atmospheric glow. Lower portion shows more cloud coverage in lighter tones. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'I TRIED DEBUNKING THE FLAT EARTH'. Lower right corner shows 'Nick Havok' signature/watermark. Meme describes common flat Earth conversion narrative where skeptics claim they initially set out to disprove flat Earth theory but became convinced by their research. Ironically, image actually shows Earth's curvature - gentle arc of horizon visible across frame. However, some flat Earthers claim this curvature is fisheye lens distortion from camera. At very high altitudes (above 50,000 feet), Earth's curvature becomes clearly visible to human eye and cameras with wide-angle lenses. Standard windows and cameras can show curvature from commercial flight altitudes (~35,000 feet) though more subtle. Image demonstrates exactly what debunking flat Earth would show - observable curvature. Common psychological phenomenon where confirmation bias leads people to interpret evidence supporting preexisting beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence4:T858,Robert Simmon quote about photoshopped Earth images from NASA. Infographic featuring NASA Earth photograph with controversial quote about image processing. Top text in light blue on black background: 'The Only People Who Are Mad At You For Speaking The Truth Are Those Who Are Living A Lie'. Center shows famous NASA Earth photograph - Blue Marble-style image of Earth from space showing North America continent prominently. Image displays spherical Earth with deep blue oceans, white swirling cloud formations, brown-tan-green landmasses showing southwestern USA, Mexico, Central America. White polar ice/clouds visible at top. Pacific Ocean on left, Atlantic on right. Photorealistic appearance with cloud shadows, atmospheric glow at edges. Across center of Earth image, large bold white text overlaid: 'YOUR WORLD IS PHOTOSHOPPED'. Below Earth photo, explanatory quote box: '"It is photoshopped but it has to be" says Data Visualizer and designer Robert Simmon, "Mr Blue Marble" (NASA)'. Bottom displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in large blue text on black background. Quote refers to Robert Simmon's explanation that NASA Earth images are composite images created from multiple satellite passes, stitched together and color-corrected. This is standard practice because: 1) Satellites orbit at 400-36,000 km altitude, too close to photograph entire Earth hemisphere in single frame, 2) Different sensors capture different wavelengths requiring processing to create true-color images, 3) Multiple orbital passes needed to compile cloud-free views, 4) Image processing enhances features for public/scientific use. 'Photoshopped' doesn't mean fake - means processed/composited. Similar to how smartphone photos are processed. Flat Earth community presents this as admission of fraud, but Simmon explained it's necessary technical process to create usable images from raw satellite data. Thousands of Earth photos exist from various sources (Apollo missions, ISS, DSCOVR satellite, astronauts, weather satellites) all showing spherical Earth. Quote taken out of context to suggest deception when actually describes standard image processing5:T8b6,NASA budget versus Earth images meme claiming photography fraud. Image macro questioning NASA's use of taxpayer funding featuring space photograph. Top text in large bold white letters on black background: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016, $19.3 BILLION'. Center displays dramatic nighttime Earth photograph from space showing planet from orbital perspective. Image shows curved edge of Earth with distinctive thin blue-green line of atmosphere/aurora creating glowing arc along horizon. Below atmospheric layer visible extensive city lights across landmass appearing as golden-orange scattered points and clusters illuminating populated regions - likely showing North America or Europe based on light patterns. Darker areas represent oceans or unpopulated regions. Dense concentrations of lights indicate major metropolitan areas with connecting illuminated highways visible as glowing lines between cities. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Lower atmosphere shows subtle green auroral glow. Earth's curvature clearly visible. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'WHAT DO WE GET FOR THAT ?? FAKE PICTURES OF THE EARTH!!'. Lower left corner shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Flat Earth argument claims NASA's large budget produces only fake CGI images rather than authentic space photography. However, NASA's $19.3B budget (2016) funded far more than Earth photography: planetary missions (Mars rovers, Juno at Jupiter), space telescopes (Hubble, Kepler), ISS operations, aeronautics research, climate monitoring satellites, technology development, hundreds of ongoing missions. Earth photography is tiny fraction of activities. This particular image appears genuine - shows realistic atmospheric layers, light pollution patterns matching population density, proper orbital perspective, accurate aurora, consistent lighting. Multiple independent space agencies (ESA, ROSCOSMOS, JAXA, CNSA, ISRO) plus commercial entities (SpaceX, Blue Origin) all produce similar Earth photographs. Thousands of astronauts from dozens of countries have photographed Earth. All show spherical planet. Calling images 'fake' dismisses overwhelming photographic evidence from countless independent sources over 60+ years of spaceflight0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-269","title":"Other 269","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717444_466164306916642_6606864137146950786_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-268","title":"Other 268","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717195_464587673740972_8818418021323406562_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-270","title":"Other 270","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717576_462951923904547_468875960546489441_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
