Controversial meme implies globe Earth is example of 'big lie' propaganda technique where repeated assertion of falsehood leads to mass acceptance. Attempts to invoke Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' theories about repetitive lying to discredit mainstream science and media. Ethically problematic use of Hitler quote to support flat Earth theory.

Bottom text: 'Because there is no edge to fall off of! It's a wall and you know it as Antarctica. Earth is flat! Research it!' Watermark repeated.
