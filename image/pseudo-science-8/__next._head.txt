Yellow text quote: 'The failure of the many attempts to measure terrestrially any effects of the earth's motion...' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, WOLFGANG PAULIL •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. References Pauli discussing null results of experiments attempting to detect Earth's motion through space (likely referencing Michelson-Morley and similar experiments). Quote appears to support stationary Earth interpretation, though historically Pauli accepted special relativity which explained null results through spacetime framework rather than stationary Earth. Selective quote mining to suggest prominent physicist questioned Earth's motion, omitting his acceptance of relativistic physics that reconciled experimental results with heliocentric model."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 8"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Black and white portrait quote meme showing physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) in formal attire.
