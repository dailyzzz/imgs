Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'The failure of the many attempts to measure terrestrially any effects of the earth's motion...' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, WOLFGANG PAULIL •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. References Pauli discussing null results of experiments attempting to detect Earth's motion through space (likely referencing Michelson-Morley and similar experiments). Quote appears to support stationary Earth interpretation, though historically Pauli accepted special relativity which explained null results through spacetime framework rather than stationary Earth. Selective quote mining to suggest prominent physicist questioned Earth's motion, omitting his acceptance of relativistic physics that reconciled experimental results with heliocentric model."},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-7","title":"Pseudo Science 7","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/18920275_1575680715788848_6214679928063501643_n.jpeg","description":"Conspiracy meme titled 'FREEMASON SCIENCE' showing image of Earth partially submerged in red water/ocean against dark red sky. Lists three statistics all containing number 666: 'Earth revolves around the sun at: 66,600 mph' (in large yellow numbers), 'Curvature of one square mile: 666 ft' (in yellow), 'Earth tilts at: 66.6°' (in yellow), followed by bottom text 'STILL THINK IT'S ALL A COINCIDENCE?' Claims recurring 666 (biblical 'number of the beast') in Earth's physical parameters is intentional Masonic/occult symbolism embedded in heliocentric model, suggesting scientific establishment deliberately fabricated measurements with satanic numerology. Implies heliocentric model is Masonic conspiracy rather than empirical astronomy, though actual values differ from those cited."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-9","title":"Pseudo Science 9","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19260337_247795949041885_5448790151880778285_n.jpeg","description":"Quote meme with dark gray background showing famous Apollo 17 Blue Marble Earth photograph (blue planet with white clouds, showing Africa and Arabia).
