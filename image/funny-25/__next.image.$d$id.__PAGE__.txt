Santa pointing at Blue Marble Earth photograph floating beside him, with knowing wink and gesture. Top text in white reads 'REMEMBER THE LAST TIME YOU BELIEVED IN SOMETHING THAT WASN'T REAL'. Bottom text states 'AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO LET IT GO'. Compares childhood belief in Santa Claus to adult belief in spherical Earth, suggesting both are comforting myths that are difficult to abandon despite evidence.

Blue-uniformed cheerleader in center with back to camera, hair in motion. Two labeled groups: left side shows 'GLOBE LOVER' (man in suit looking disinterested), right side shows 'FLAT EARTH PROOFS' (appears as cheerleader's label). Humorous comparison suggesting flat Earth proofs are as attractive and attention-grabbing as cheerleader performing, while globe believers sit unmoved and unimpressed. Implies flat Earth evidence is eye-catching and hard to ignore once seen"},"nextImage":{"id":"funny-26","title":"Funny 26","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/49210647_292161158323856_2392397865927311360_n.jpeg","description":"Skeptical cat meme featuring close-up of orange and white tabby cat with intense unimpressed expression and narrowed eyes.
