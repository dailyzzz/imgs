5:T80a,Pool balls on felt table sarcastic sphere logic meme. Satirical photograph mocking flawed reasoning about spheres and surfaces. Top text in large bold white letters: 'THESE POOL BALLS ARE SPHERES'. Image shows pool/billiards table with bright turquoise-blue felt surface. Cluster of standard pool balls (numbered 1-15) arranged in breaking formation - triangular rack pattern with balls touching. Balls show various solid and striped colors: white cue ball separate at left, yellow (1), blue (2), red (3), purple (4), orange (5), green (6), maroon/burgundy (7), black (8), yellow striped (9), blue striped (10), red striped (11), purple striped (12), orange striped (13), green striped (14), maroon striped (15). Balls highly polished with visible reflections and highlights showing spherical shape. Wooden cue stick visible at top right edge with brass ferrule and white tip. Lower right shows 'Flat Earth Matters' attribution in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'THIS TABLE MUST BE A SPHERE TOO'. Meme sarcastically mocks logical fallacy in flat Earth arguments. Format follows reductio ad absurdum - if pool balls being spheres means table must be spherical, then absurd conclusion reveals flawed logic. Parodies flat Earth reasoning patterns that make non-sequitur connections. However, meme actually strawmans globe Earth position - nobody claims Earth is sphere BECAUSE objects on it are spherical. Earth's sphericity determined by: measurements of curvature (ships disappearing hull-first), circumnavigation, satellite imagery, varying star visibility with latitude, Foucault pendulum, Eratosthenes' shadow measurements (240 BC), lunar eclipse shadows showing round Earth, physics of planetary formation (gravity pulls matter into spheres above certain mass). Objects' shapes don't determine surface shape - spherical objects rest on flat tables, flat papers rest on spherical Earth. Both work fine. Meme creates false equivalence between scale (small objects vs 12,742 km diameter planet) and misrepresents scientific reasoning0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 294 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Pool balls on felt table sarcastic sphere logic meme.
