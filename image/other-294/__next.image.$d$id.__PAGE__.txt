3:T80a,Pool balls on felt table sarcastic sphere logic meme. Satirical photograph mocking flawed reasoning about spheres and surfaces. Top text in large bold white letters: 'THESE POOL BALLS ARE SPHERES'. Image shows pool/billiards table with bright turquoise-blue felt surface. Cluster of standard pool balls (numbered 1-15) arranged in breaking formation - triangular rack pattern with balls touching. Balls show various solid and striped colors: white cue ball separate at left, yellow (1), blue (2), red (3), purple (4), orange (5), green (6), maroon/burgundy (7), black (8), yellow striped (9), blue striped (10), red striped (11), purple striped (12), orange striped (13), green striped (14), maroon striped (15). Balls highly polished with visible reflections and highlights showing spherical shape. Wooden cue stick visible at top right edge with brass ferrule and white tip. Lower right shows 'Flat Earth Matters' attribution in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'THIS TABLE MUST BE A SPHERE TOO'. Meme sarcastically mocks logical fallacy in flat Earth arguments. Format follows reductio ad absurdum - if pool balls being spheres means table must be spherical, then absurd conclusion reveals flawed logic. Parodies flat Earth reasoning patterns that make non-sequitur connections. However, meme actually strawmans globe Earth position - nobody claims Earth is sphere BECAUSE objects on it are spherical. Earth's sphericity determined by: measurements of curvature (ships disappearing hull-first), circumnavigation, satellite imagery, varying star visibility with latitude, Foucault pendulum, Eratosthenes' shadow measurements (240 BC), lunar eclipse shadows showing round Earth, physics of planetary formation (gravity pulls matter into spheres above certain mass). Objects' shapes don't determine surface shape - spherical objects rest on flat tables, flat papers rest on spherical Earth. Both work fine. Meme creates false equivalence between scale (small objects vs 12,742 km diameter planet) and misrepresents scientific reasoning4:T894,The Seven Luminaries flat Earth cosmology diagram. Artistic illustration showing flat Earth model with seven celestial bodies labeled as 'luminaries'. Black background with dark gray double-border frame. Upper portion shows circular flat Earth disc viewed from above - blue oceans surrounding green continents arranged around central white Arctic/North Pole. North America visible on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia top and left, Australia lower left. Outer ring shows thick white/gray ice barrier representing Antarctica. Central area displays photorealistic continents with natural coloring. Below Earth disc arranged in two rows: planetary bodies shown as spheres with labels. Top row left to right: Mars (small reddish-orange sphere labeled 'MARS'), Venus (pale cream sphere labeled 'VENUS'), Jupiter (large tan sphere with bands labeled 'JUPITER'), Mercury (small gray-tan sphere labeled 'MERCURY'), Saturn (pale yellow sphere with distinctive ring system labeled 'SATURN'). Bottom row: Sun (bright orange-yellow glowing sphere labeled 'SUN'), white triangular mountain peak (labeled 'HOLY MOUNTAIN'), Moon (gray cratered sphere labeled 'MOON'). Holy Mountain positioned centrally between sun and moon. All celestial objects rendered with realistic textures - Mars shows red surface, Jupiter shows swirling bands, Saturn's rings detailed, Moon shows craters, Sun has glowing corona effect. Bottom text in italics: 'THE 7 LUMINARIES'. Diagram represents esoteric flat Earth cosmology combining seven classical 'wandering stars' (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) with biblical/ancient cosmology. In ancient astronomy, these seven celestial bodies were 'luminaries' or 'wanderers' distinguishable from fixed stars. Inclusion of 'Holy Mountain' references various mythological cosmologies placing sacred mountain at world's center (Mount Meru in Hindu/Buddhist, Mount Olympus in Greek, Zion in Abrahamic traditions). However, modern astronomy understands Sun as star, Moon as natural satellite, five planets as worlds orbiting Sun. Saturn's rings, Jupiter's atmospheric bands, Mars' surface features all extensively documented by spacecraft5:T964,Three-panel meme comparing physics astronomy and astrophysics conclusions. Composite image with three horizontal panels making claims about different scientific fields. Top panel shows 3D rendered flat Earth disc with glowing rim against starry black space background. Earth disc displays blue oceans, green-brown continents, white ice wall around perimeter. Sun shown as bright light source above and behind disc creating atmospheric glow and lens flare effects. Text overlay in white sans-serif font: 'Physics proves the Flat Earth'. Middle panel displays classical Renaissance religious painting showing Jesus Christ as teacher/scholar. Figure wears red and green robes, has brown hair, beard, peaceful expression, gestures with hands in teaching pose. Painting style suggests 16th-17th century European religious art with muted earth tones, classical composition. Background shows architectural elements. Text overlay: 'Astronomy proves God'. Bottom panel shows scientific visualization of spacetime curvature - abstract representation with pink-red curved grid surface warping into depression, suggesting gravitational effects on fabric of space. Grid lines curve downward showing massive object's effect on spacetime geometry. Visualization resembles illustrations of Einstein's general relativity. Bright light source visible creating dramatic effect. Bottom shows 'SPACETIME ODYSSEY' text. Main text overlay: 'Astrophysics proves the gullibility of the human being'. Lower portion credits 'fb.com/aterraeplana' with additional text 'With Astrophysical and Host Neil deGrasse Tyson' and 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey'. Meme argues three scientific fields lead to contradictory conclusions: physics supposedly proves flat Earth, astronomy proves God's existence, astrophysics proves human gullibility. Implies scientific fields contradict each other, suggesting science untrustworthy. However, physics, astronomy, and astrophysics are interconnected disciplines using same fundamental principles - they don't contradict. All three confirm spherical Earth through: orbital mechanics, planetary observations, spacetime measurements, gravitational calculations. Reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' series suggests mainstream science promotes false narrative. Meme employs false trichotomy suggesting must choose between contradictory scientific conclusions when in reality they're complementary0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-294","title":"Other 294","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742737_468137263386013_8988751100282107941_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-293","title":"Other 293","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742666_464902050376201_1952265792957127379_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-295","title":"Other 295","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12743640_465617443637995_4398938829548486463_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
