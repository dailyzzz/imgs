5:T1bba,NASA Earth images comparison claiming inconsistency between Blue Marble photographs proves images are computer-generated simulations, not real photographs. Grid layout comparing official NASA Earth images from different dates with simulated globe renderings, suggesting NASA fabricates Earth imagery because continent sizes appear different. Flat Earth argument that Earth photos are CGI/Photoshop, not genuine photographs from space. IMAGE LAYOUT: Seven globe images arranged in grid format against black background. Left column labeled "NASA VERSION" shows two official NASA photographs. Right section shows five "simulation" globes for comparison. Explanatory text at top right reads: "Simulation of the globe on the dates the images were taken and remastered." LEFT COLUMN - NASA IMAGES: TOP LEFT GLOBE: Labeled "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972 01/04/2012" - Famous "Blue Marble" photograph from Apollo 17 mission (December 7, 1972) compared with 2012 image. Shows Earth with Africa prominently visible, blue oceans, white cloud formations. This is one of most famous photographs ever taken - full Earth illuminated by sun behind camera during Apollo 17's journey to moon. Image shows Earth from approximately 28,000 miles away. Classic view with Africa, Arabia, Antarctica visible. BOTTOM LEFT GLOBE: Another NASA Earth image, appearing similar to top image but potentially different date/source. Shows similar view of Africa-centered hemisphere with cloud patterns and ocean colors. Both NASA images show blue planet with recognizable continental shapes, white clouds, atmospheric haze at edges. RIGHT SECTION - SIMULATION COMPARISON: Five computer-generated globe models showing Earth on specific dates for comparison with NASA photographs. Row 1: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - simulations showing expected appearance on dates NASA images were supposedly taken. Row 2: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - additional simulation views. Simulations appear to use satellite/map data projected onto sphere to show expected Earth appearance on specific dates. PURPOSE OF COMPARISON: Image creator attempts to show discrepancies between NASA photographs and computer simulations of Earth on same dates. Implication: If NASA photos were genuine, they should exactly match simulations of Earth's appearance. Any differences suggest NASA photos are fabricated/manipulated. Flat Earth community argues NASA images show Africa at different sizes, continent shapes vary between photos, cloud patterns impossible, etc. - "proving" images are computer-generated rather than genuine photographs. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NASA LIES: Space agency fabricates imagery rather than photographing real spherical Earth (which flat Earthers believe doesn't exist). All "Earth from space" photos are CGI, Photoshop, composites, or studio shots. 2) INCONSISTENCY PROVES FAKERY: If Earth photos were real, they'd be consistent. Variations between images (continent size, color, cloud patterns) prove manipulation. Real photographs would show identical planet; CGI introduces errors. 3) TECHNOLOGY WASN'T AVAILABLE: In 1972, digital manipulation wasn't possible, but flat Earthers claim photos were faked using other techniques (paintings, models, studio work). Modern images are CGI because technology now exists. 4) BLUE MARBLE ADMITTED COMPOSITE: NASA has stated that many modern Earth images are composites from multiple satellite passes stitched together. Flat Earthers interpret any compositing as proof of total fakery - if any manipulation occurs, entire image is fabricated. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) DIFFERENT DISTANCES/PERSPECTIVES: Earth photos from different distances show continents at different apparent sizes due to perspective. Apollo 17 was ~28,000 miles from Earth; satellites orbit at various altitudes (250-22,000+ miles). Closer = different perspective on curved surface. 2) CAMERA/LENS DIFFERENCES: Different cameras, lenses, focal lengths produce different results. Fish-eye vs telephoto lenses change apparent curvature and proportion. Comparing images from different cameras isn't valid test of authenticity. 3) ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS: Cloud cover, atmospheric clarity, lighting angle all change Earth's appearance. No two photographs of Earth will be identical because conditions constantly change. Demanding identical images misunderstands photography. 4) COMPOSITE VS FAKE: Yes, some NASA images are composites - multiple photos stitched together for higher resolution or to show features normally not visible together. Composite is standard photographic technique, not evidence of fabrication. Panoramic photos, HDR images, focus stacking are all "composites" - doesn't make them fake. 5) MULTIPLE SOURCES: Earth images come from NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China), ISRO (India), Roscosmos (Russia), private companies (SpaceX, Planet Labs), amateur radio operators, weather balloons, etc. Would require global conspiracy among competing/adversarial nations to all produce consistent "fake" spherical Earth images. 6) LIVE FEEDS: ISS provides live video feed showing Earth. Weather satellites provide continuous imagery. These aren't single photos that could be fabricated - they're ongoing streams matching weather patterns, day/night cycles, seasonal changes in real time. 7) YOU CAN VERIFY: Amateur astronomers photograph ISS passing overhead. High-altitude balloon enthusiasts photograph Earth's curvature. Anyone with sufficient resources can launch balloon camera and see curvature themselves. No reliance on NASA required. SPECIFIC IMAGE ANALYSIS: The 1972 Blue Marble is genuine photograph taken by astronauts on film camera during Apollo 17 mission. Original film exists, has been examined, shows no evidence of manipulation. Africa appears "large" because camera was positioned to center Africa in frame - this is normal perspective effect when photographing sphere up close. Claiming Africa looks "different size" in different photos fails to account for: distance from Earth, camera position, lens focal length, and perspective geometry of photographing curved surfaces. ATTRIBUTION: "fb.com/aterraeplana" visible in bottom left - Portuguese flat Earth community page (terra plana = flat earth in Portuguese). Indicates this is flat Earth propaganda image designed to cast doubt on NASA imagery by creating false expectation that all Earth photos should look identical regardless of when, where, and how they were taken. VISUAL RHETORIC: Grid layout suggests systematic comparison/analysis. Side-by-side format implies equivalence between NASA photos and simulations. Labeling with specific dates creates impression of scientific rigor. But comparison is fundamentally flawed - expecting photographs taken under different conditions to be identical demonstrates misunderstanding of photography, perspective, and the physical process of imaging a sphere from different distances and angles. Image designed to create doubt through apparent inconsistency while ignoring explanations for normal variation between photographs.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 382 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"NASA Earth images comparison claiming inconsistency between Blue Marble photographs proves images are computer-generated simulations, not real photographs.
