3:T1bba,NASA Earth images comparison claiming inconsistency between Blue Marble photographs proves images are computer-generated simulations, not real photographs. Grid layout comparing official NASA Earth images from different dates with simulated globe renderings, suggesting NASA fabricates Earth imagery because continent sizes appear different. Flat Earth argument that Earth photos are CGI/Photoshop, not genuine photographs from space. IMAGE LAYOUT: Seven globe images arranged in grid format against black background. Left column labeled "NASA VERSION" shows two official NASA photographs. Right section shows five "simulation" globes for comparison. Explanatory text at top right reads: "Simulation of the globe on the dates the images were taken and remastered." LEFT COLUMN - NASA IMAGES: TOP LEFT GLOBE: Labeled "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972 01/04/2012" - Famous "Blue Marble" photograph from Apollo 17 mission (December 7, 1972) compared with 2012 image. Shows Earth with Africa prominently visible, blue oceans, white cloud formations. This is one of most famous photographs ever taken - full Earth illuminated by sun behind camera during Apollo 17's journey to moon. Image shows Earth from approximately 28,000 miles away. Classic view with Africa, Arabia, Antarctica visible. BOTTOM LEFT GLOBE: Another NASA Earth image, appearing similar to top image but potentially different date/source. Shows similar view of Africa-centered hemisphere with cloud patterns and ocean colors. Both NASA images show blue planet with recognizable continental shapes, white clouds, atmospheric haze at edges. RIGHT SECTION - SIMULATION COMPARISON: Five computer-generated globe models showing Earth on specific dates for comparison with NASA photographs. Row 1: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - simulations showing expected appearance on dates NASA images were supposedly taken. Row 2: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - additional simulation views. Simulations appear to use satellite/map data projected onto sphere to show expected Earth appearance on specific dates. PURPOSE OF COMPARISON: Image creator attempts to show discrepancies between NASA photographs and computer simulations of Earth on same dates. Implication: If NASA photos were genuine, they should exactly match simulations of Earth's appearance. Any differences suggest NASA photos are fabricated/manipulated. Flat Earth community argues NASA images show Africa at different sizes, continent shapes vary between photos, cloud patterns impossible, etc. - "proving" images are computer-generated rather than genuine photographs. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NASA LIES: Space agency fabricates imagery rather than photographing real spherical Earth (which flat Earthers believe doesn't exist). All "Earth from space" photos are CGI, Photoshop, composites, or studio shots. 2) INCONSISTENCY PROVES FAKERY: If Earth photos were real, they'd be consistent. Variations between images (continent size, color, cloud patterns) prove manipulation. Real photographs would show identical planet; CGI introduces errors. 3) TECHNOLOGY WASN'T AVAILABLE: In 1972, digital manipulation wasn't possible, but flat Earthers claim photos were faked using other techniques (paintings, models, studio work). Modern images are CGI because technology now exists. 4) BLUE MARBLE ADMITTED COMPOSITE: NASA has stated that many modern Earth images are composites from multiple satellite passes stitched together. Flat Earthers interpret any compositing as proof of total fakery - if any manipulation occurs, entire image is fabricated. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) DIFFERENT DISTANCES/PERSPECTIVES: Earth photos from different distances show continents at different apparent sizes due to perspective. Apollo 17 was ~28,000 miles from Earth; satellites orbit at various altitudes (250-22,000+ miles). Closer = different perspective on curved surface. 2) CAMERA/LENS DIFFERENCES: Different cameras, lenses, focal lengths produce different results. Fish-eye vs telephoto lenses change apparent curvature and proportion. Comparing images from different cameras isn't valid test of authenticity. 3) ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS: Cloud cover, atmospheric clarity, lighting angle all change Earth's appearance. No two photographs of Earth will be identical because conditions constantly change. Demanding identical images misunderstands photography. 4) COMPOSITE VS FAKE: Yes, some NASA images are composites - multiple photos stitched together for higher resolution or to show features normally not visible together. Composite is standard photographic technique, not evidence of fabrication. Panoramic photos, HDR images, focus stacking are all "composites" - doesn't make them fake. 5) MULTIPLE SOURCES: Earth images come from NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China), ISRO (India), Roscosmos (Russia), private companies (SpaceX, Planet Labs), amateur radio operators, weather balloons, etc. Would require global conspiracy among competing/adversarial nations to all produce consistent "fake" spherical Earth images. 6) LIVE FEEDS: ISS provides live video feed showing Earth. Weather satellites provide continuous imagery. These aren't single photos that could be fabricated - they're ongoing streams matching weather patterns, day/night cycles, seasonal changes in real time. 7) YOU CAN VERIFY: Amateur astronomers photograph ISS passing overhead. High-altitude balloon enthusiasts photograph Earth's curvature. Anyone with sufficient resources can launch balloon camera and see curvature themselves. No reliance on NASA required. SPECIFIC IMAGE ANALYSIS: The 1972 Blue Marble is genuine photograph taken by astronauts on film camera during Apollo 17 mission. Original film exists, has been examined, shows no evidence of manipulation. Africa appears "large" because camera was positioned to center Africa in frame - this is normal perspective effect when photographing sphere up close. Claiming Africa looks "different size" in different photos fails to account for: distance from Earth, camera position, lens focal length, and perspective geometry of photographing curved surfaces. ATTRIBUTION: "fb.com/aterraeplana" visible in bottom left - Portuguese flat Earth community page (terra plana = flat earth in Portuguese). Indicates this is flat Earth propaganda image designed to cast doubt on NASA imagery by creating false expectation that all Earth photos should look identical regardless of when, where, and how they were taken. VISUAL RHETORIC: Grid layout suggests systematic comparison/analysis. Side-by-side format implies equivalence between NASA photos and simulations. Labeling with specific dates creates impression of scientific rigor. But comparison is fundamentally flawed - expecting photographs taken under different conditions to be identical demonstrates misunderstanding of photography, perspective, and the physical process of imaging a sphere from different distances and angles. Image designed to create doubt through apparent inconsistency while ignoring explanations for normal variation between photographs.4:T1f31,Burning globe Earth image with text claiming exposing "globe Earth lie" causes modern science, gravity, Big Bang, and evolution to "fall apart." Dramatic apocalyptic imagery showing Earth as flaming sphere being destroyed, representing flat Earth belief that spherical Earth is foundational lie upon which all modern science is built. Image suggests rejecting globe Earth leads to spiritual awakening and self-discovery. VISUAL COMPOSITION: Background shows serene natural landscape - calm water (lake or sea) reflecting sky, mountains or hills in distance, golden/amber atmospheric lighting suggesting sunrise or sunset. Peaceful natural scene contrasts dramatically with central destruction imagery. CENTRAL IMAGE: Globe Earth depicted as sphere engulfed in flames and fire. Planet appears to be burning, disintegrating, or exploding. Fire effects show orange, yellow, red flames consuming the sphere. Globe shows recognizable continental shapes (Africa visible) being destroyed by flames. Artistic rendering combining photograph of landscape with digitally composited burning globe. Symbolism clear: the "lie" of globe Earth being destroyed/exposed, burning away deception to reveal truth. Water reflection shows burning globe mirrored below, creating symmetrical composition. TEXT CONTENT - Multiple layers of text overlaid on image: TOP TEXT (yellow, large font): "WHEN WE EXPOSE THE GLOBE EARTH LIE" - Opening statement framing spherical Earth as deliberate deception to be revealed/exposed. MIDDLE TEXT (yellow, smaller font, sequential statements): "MODERN SCIENCE FALLS APART" - Claim that globe Earth is foundation of modern science, removing it collapses everything. "WHICH CAUSES THE THEORY OF GRAVITY TO FALL APART" - Gravity specifically targeted as dependent on globe Earth model. "WHICH CAUSES THE BIG BANG THEORY TO FALL APART" - Cosmological origins theory linked to globe Earth. "WHICH CAUSES EVOLUTION TO FALL APART" - Evolutionary biology connected to globe model. "AND WHEN WE FINALLY REALIZE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT EVERYTHING" - Culminating claim of total systematic deception. BOTTOM TEXT (yellow, large font): "WE CAN THEN BEGIN TO DISCOVER WHO WE TRULY ARE AND WHY WE ARE HERE" - Spiritual/existential conclusion suggesting flat Earth truth leads to self-discovery and purpose. ATTRIBUTION: "Nick Havok" credited in bottom right corner - likely image creator. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT STRUCTURE: Image presents domino theory of scientific deception: 1) Globe Earth is the foundational lie. 2) Gravity was invented to explain how things stay on spinning ball (flat Earth claims gravity is fake, density/buoyancy explains falling objects). 3) Big Bang requires universe of spherical planets/stars (flat Earth model has different cosmology - dome/firmament over flat plane). 4) Evolution requires billions of years and cosmic scale that globe Earth/Big Bang provides (flat Earth often tied to young Earth creationism). 5) All modern science built on these interconnected "lies." 6) Exposing globe Earth topples entire edifice of scientific knowledge. 7) Once "truth" revealed, spiritual awakening follows - discovering true nature of reality, humanity's purpose, perhaps religious truth previously hidden by scientific materialism. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE: Globe Earth, gravity, Big Bang, evolution are separate theories with independent evidence. Disproving one wouldn't automatically disprove others. Each supported by different types of evidence from different fields. 2) GRAVITY: Gravity is directly observable (objects fall, tides occur, planets orbit). Mathematical predictions of gravitational theory verified to extreme precision. GPS satellites, space missions, planetary probes all operate using gravitational calculations that work perfectly. Gravity doesn't require belief in globe Earth - it's independently measurable. 3) BIG BANG: Supported by cosmic microwave background radiation, observed expansion of universe, abundance of light elements, galaxy formation observations. Evidence doesn't depend on Earth's shape - comes from telescopes and instruments measuring distant cosmos. 4) EVOLUTION: Supported by fossil record, genetic evidence, observed speciation, biogeography, comparative anatomy. Evidence comes from biology, genetics, paleontology - fields unrelated to Earth's shape. Evolution would be true whether Earth is sphere, flat, or cube. 5) GLOBE EARTH: Supported by circumnavigation, satellite imagery, physics of gravity, astronomical observations, ship disappearance over horizon, time zones, different star visibility at different latitudes, lunar eclipse shadow, and countless other independent observations. Not arbitrary choice but conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. CONSPIRACY THEORY STRUCTURE: Image exemplifies "grand unified conspiracy" thinking where multiple separate "lies" are connected into single massive deception: If globe Earth is lie, then NASA lies, then space exploration is fake, then satellites are fake, then physics is wrong, then Big Bang is fiction, then evolution is fiction, then all scientists are either deceived or complicit, then entire educational system spreads lies, then media reinforces lies, then governments worldwide cooperate in deception. This creates unfalsifiable worldview where any contradicting evidence is simply "part of the lie." Scale of conspiracy required is impossibly large - millions of scientists, educators, pilots, sailors, engineers would need to be deceived or actively lying. RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL DIMENSION: Final line about discovering "who we truly are and why we are here" reveals spiritual motivation underlying many flat Earth beliefs. Movement often connected to: Biblical literalism (interpreting verses about firmament, pillars of Earth, four corners literally). Rejection of scientific materialism as spiritually empty worldview. Belief that globe Earth/evolution/Big Bang specifically designed to undermine religious faith. Sense that scientific establishment is Satanic or anti-God conspiracy. Desire for humanity to have special cosmic significance (flat Earth with dome often places humanity at center of creation, unlike heliocentric model where Earth is one planet among billions). PSYCHOLOGICAL APPEAL: Image appeals to: Distrust of authority/institutions. Desire for hidden knowledge. Sense of being special/awakened while masses are deceived. Spiritual seeking and desire for meaning. Rejection of complexity in favor of simple explanations. Community belonging in alternative truth movement. Feeling empowered by "seeing through lies" that fooled everyone else. VISUAL RHETORIC: Burning globe is powerful symbolic image: Destruction of false beliefs (cathartic). Fire as purification (burning away deception). Dramatic apocalyptic imagery appealing to those expecting end times or great awakening. Juxtaposition with peaceful nature background suggests truth brings serenity while lies create chaos. Reflection in water creates dreamlike quality suggesting transition between states of consciousness. Golden lighting evokes spiritual/mystical atmosphere. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works as propaganda by: Presenting complex scientific topics as single interconnected conspiracy rather than separate fields. Using emotional imagery (burning, destruction) rather than logical argument. Promising spiritual reward (self-discovery, purpose) for accepting flat Earth truth. Creating us-vs-them dynamic (awakened few vs deceived masses). Providing simple explanation for complex world (it's all lies). Not requiring viewer to understand any actual science - just reject it wholesale. CRITIQUE: Image makes claims without evidence, assumes connections between unrelated fields, requires impossibly large conspiracy, contradicts directly observable reality, appeals to emotion rather than reason, and promises unfalsifiable spiritual rewards for belief. Represents conspiracy thinking pattern rather than scientific inquiry.5:T1b55,News article screenshot showing "FLAT EARTH" graffiti vandalism on Burnham-on-Sea seawall in England, with mayor expressing dismay. Local news coverage of two-metre tall flat Earth graffiti spray-painted on coastal wall, shared by flat Earth community as example of movement's visibility and public presence. Article documents real-world flat Earth activism through vandalism while authorities express disapproval. ARTICLE HEADER: Headline reads "Mayor's dismay at two-metre tall graffiti daubed on Burnham's sea wall" - Local official reacting negatively to vandalism. Subheading establishes location and describes damage. Source identified as Burnham-On-Sea.com News - local online news outlet covering Somerset, England coastal town. MAIN PHOTOGRAPH: Image shows concrete sea wall along beach with large white spray-painted text reading "FLAT EARTH" in capital letters approximately two metres (6.5 feet) tall. Graffiti clearly visible from distance, professionally photographed for news article. Location is Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, England - seaside resort town on Bristol Channel coast. SEAWALL STRUCTURE: Concrete defensive wall protecting town from tidal flooding. Wall appears gray concrete with vertical supports/buttresses at regular intervals. Horizontal surface along top forms walkway. Beach visible in foreground - sandy with some wave patterns visible. Wall extends across image showing substantial structure. GRAFFITI DETAILS: White paint letters spelling "FLAT EARTH" in rough hand-painted style typical of graffiti. Letters appear hastily applied but legible from considerable distance. Two-metre height makes statement highly visible to beach visitors and seafront pedestrians. Paint appears fresh in photograph suggesting recent application. Style is basic block letters without artistic elaboration - functional messaging rather than artistic graffiti. BACKGROUND BUILDINGS: Behind seawall, Victorian/Edwardian era buildings visible - typical British seaside architecture including what appears to be hotel or large residential building with distinctive towers/turrets. Multiple stories with traditional English coastal resort character. Buildings suggest established resort town with historic seafront development. ARTICLE CONTEXT: Local mayor quoted expressing "dismay" at vandalism - official disapproval of property damage. Article treats incident as minor local crime story rather than discussion of flat Earth beliefs. Focus on vandalism aspect and cleanup costs rather than legitimacy of flat Earth claims. News coverage frames flat Earthers as vandals damaging public property, not as truth-seekers spreading important message. FLAT EARTH COMMUNITY RESPONSE: Screenshot shared by flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters attribution visible) celebrating visibility of message. Sharing news coverage serves multiple purposes: 1) Shows flat Earth message reaching mainstream media. 2) Demonstrates dedicated believers taking action. 3) Creates sense of growing movement willing to act publicly. 4) Frames negative coverage as publicity regardless of tone. Any press is good press mentality. VANDALISM AS ACTIVISM: Graffiti represents extreme end of flat Earth activism spectrum. Most flat Earth activity is online (social media, YouTube, forums), but some believers engage in real-world actions: attending conferences, creating signs, producing merchandise, and occasionally vandalism. Public graffiti aims to: Plant seeds of doubt in passersby. Demonstrate conviction (risk of legal consequences shows dedication). Create talking point and news coverage. Mark territory/claim public space for message. Recruit curious observers who research after seeing message. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS: Graffiti vandalism is criminal offense in UK. Perpetrator could face: Criminal damage charges, fines, community service, potential imprisonment for serious cases. Cleanup costs passed to local council (taxpayers). Negative publicity for flat Earth movement among general public who view vandalism negatively. Most people seeing this would think "vandals" not "truth-tellers." EFFECTIVENESS DEBATE: Within flat Earth community, opinions on activism tactics vary. Some applaud bold public action, others worry vandalism creates negative associations. Mainstream audiences likely view graffiti negatively regardless of message content. News coverage focuses on crime/cleanup rather than message legitimacy. May attract attention but probably not positive conversion. Comparison to other movements: Environmental activists, political protesters sometimes use graffiti - debatable effectiveness for any cause. GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT: Burnham-on-Sea is small town (population ~20,000) in Somerset, southwest England. Seaside location with traditional beach tourism. Sea wall is protective infrastructure and public amenity. Flat Earth graffiti here suggests either: Local flat Earth believer taking action, or traveling activist choosing visible seaside location. Irony: Flat Earthers chose sea wall - structure built to protect against ocean tides that exist because of gravitational effects on spherical Earth's water. Sea walls designed using engineering that assumes spherical Earth model. VISUAL DOCUMENTATION: News photograph serves as documentation of incident. Clear image showing extent of vandalism, location context, readable text. Professional journalism quality suggesting established local news outlet. Image widely shareable for both those condemning vandalism and those celebrating message spread. BURNHAM-ON-SEA.COM: Local news website covering Somerset coast area. URL shown indicates source. Local online journalism providing community news. Covering this as local interest story about vandalism rather than national story about flat Earth movement. Indicates incident considered minor local crime rather than significant cultural moment. FLAT EARTH SUBCULTURE: Image demonstrates flat Earth movement extends beyond online spaces into physical world. Believers motivated enough to risk legal consequences for public messaging. Movement has dedicated activists, not just passive internet commenters. However, vandalism tactics may alienate potential converts and reinforce perception of flat Earthers as fringe extremists rather than reasonable questioners. MEDIA FRAMING: Notice how article frames story - "Mayor's dismay" emphasizes negative official reaction. "Graffiti daubed" uses verb with negative connotations (daubed = applied carelessly). Focus on size (two-metre) emphasizes scale of damage. No discussion of flat Earth claims' validity. Message treated as vandalism content rather than debatable assertion. This framing typical of mainstream coverage - flat Earth treated as self-evidently absurd, focus on social disruption rather than intellectual debate. Attribution: fb.com/fematters watermark indicates flat Earth community sharing news coverage as evidence of their movement's real-world presence and mainstream media attention, regardless of negative framing.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-382","title":"Other 382","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12923279_481720352027704_2274777867548518658_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-381","title":"Other 381","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12916949_483617311838008_9044399751281064854_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-383","title":"Other 383","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12924439_485877088278697_5816571113015467364_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
