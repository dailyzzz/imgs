5:T4bd,Leonardo DiCaprio laughing meme mocking Eratosthenes experiment. Shows scene from Django Unchained (2012) with Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie character in period costume. DiCaprio wears cream/beige suit jacket, white dress shirt, dark bow tie or cravat. Sits at table with wine glass visible. Background shows blurred figure (Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen) in dark suit. DiCaprio's face shows intense laughter - mouth wide open showing teeth, eyes squinting, leaning back in chair. Warm amber lighting suggests candlelit interior. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN SOMEONE SAYS'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center-bottom shows 'JM' logo. Bottom text: 'WE HAVE BEEN PROVING THE EARTH IS ROUND WITH STICKS IN THE SAND SINCE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.' Mocks Eratosthenes' famous experiment (circa 240 BCE) measuring Earth's circumference using shadows cast by sticks in different cities. Flat Earth proponents argue this experiment only proves sun is close and local, not that Earth is sphere. Points out same shadow length differences occur with nearby light source over flat plane. Uses DiCaprio's condescending laughter to suggest belief in ancient stick experiment is naive0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 191 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Leonardo DiCaprio laughing meme mocking Eratosthenes experiment.
