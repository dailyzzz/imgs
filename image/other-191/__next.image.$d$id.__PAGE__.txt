3:T4bd,Leonardo DiCaprio laughing meme mocking Eratosthenes experiment. Shows scene from Django Unchained (2012) with Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie character in period costume. DiCaprio wears cream/beige suit jacket, white dress shirt, dark bow tie or cravat. Sits at table with wine glass visible. Background shows blurred figure (Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen) in dark suit. DiCaprio's face shows intense laughter - mouth wide open showing teeth, eyes squinting, leaning back in chair. Warm amber lighting suggests candlelit interior. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN SOMEONE SAYS'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center-bottom shows 'JM' logo. Bottom text: 'WE HAVE BEEN PROVING THE EARTH IS ROUND WITH STICKS IN THE SAND SINCE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.' Mocks Eratosthenes' famous experiment (circa 240 BCE) measuring Earth's circumference using shadows cast by sticks in different cities. Flat Earth proponents argue this experiment only proves sun is close and local, not that Earth is sphere. Points out same shadow length differences occur with nearby light source over flat plane. Uses DiCaprio's condescending laughter to suggest belief in ancient stick experiment is naive4:T50a,Text-based gravity debunking argument over winter landscape. Background shows gray monochrome photograph of bare deciduous trees in winter with branches creating intricate patterns against overcast sky. Ground appears to show grass or field in gray tones. White text overlay reads: 'Ball-believers often claim "gravity" magically and inexplicably drags the entire lower-atmosphere of the Earth in perfect synchronization up to some undetermined height where this progressively faster spinning atmosphere gives way to the non-spinning, non-gravitized, non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space. Such non-sensical theories are debunked, however, by rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, clouds, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if both the ball-Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards at 1000mph.' Flat Earth argument questioning atmospheric physics on spinning globe. Points out objects in atmosphere (rain drops, smoke, birds) should be affected by 1000mph eastward rotation if Earth truly spins. Argues stationary atmospheric observations contradict spinning globe model. Questions how atmosphere can simultaneously rotate with Earth yet allow objects to move freely in all directions. Lists everyday phenomena as evidence against rotation5:T526,Historical azimuthal equidistant map with ornate decorative elements. Shows antique Dutch cartographic artifact titled 'AERDSCHE' (partially visible at top) meaning 'Earthly' in Dutch. Large circular map projection with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map shows Americas on left in pink/red, Europe top-center in gray, Asia right side in yellow-tan, Africa lower center, Australia bottom-right in green. Grid lines create latitude/longitude network. Outer ring decorated with gold/yellow ornamental border with black markings. Corners adorned with elaborate allegorical illustrations - cherubs, angels, mythological figures representing four winds or seasons in baroque style with flowing robes, clouds. Upper corners show figures in blue/gold/red classical dress. Lower corners feature figures in green/brown/red garments. Figures hold various objects (flags, instruments, scrolls). Map center shows compass rose with radiating lines. Geographic features labeled in Latin/Dutch. Bottom banner: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text. Historical azimuthal equidistant projections were standard for polar navigation before modern era. Flat Earth proponents cite these historical maps as evidence cartographers knew true Earth shape, though projection is geometrically valid for spherical Earth navigation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-191","title":"Other 191","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540859_457952671071139_8379451833016280622_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-190","title":"Other 190","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540838_455168971349509_3096914604043279051_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-192","title":"Other 192","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12549026_455543561312050_8252161165943916382_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
