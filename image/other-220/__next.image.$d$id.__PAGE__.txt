3:T5ad,CGI globe Earth reflected in human eye with skepticism quote. Shows close-up composite image of human eye, likely digitally manipulated. Eye shows detailed iris with blue-gray coloring, visible texture and patterns. Inside pupil or reflected on cornea appears photorealistic CGI globe Earth showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (North and South America visible), white cloud patterns. Earth appears as small sphere within eye. Surrounding eye shows skin texture, eyelashes visible at top and bottom edges, eyebrow hair visible at top. Background suggests metallic or reflective surface - blurred silver-gray tones with zebra-like black and white striped reflections suggesting curved chrome or metal surface. Right side shows large black text in bold sans-serif font: 'ONE LIE IS ENOUGH TO QUESTION... ALL "TRUTHS"' with word ALL underlined and TRUTHS in quotes. Bottom left corner displays 'flat earth matters' watermark in light blue-gray text. Image suggests if establishment lied about Earth's shape, all official narratives become suspect. Eye symbolism implies what we see and perceive may be constructed or manipulated. Reflected globe in eye suggests indoctrinated worldview literally embedded in how people see reality. Quote encourages skepticism and distrust of all mainstream information once single deception is believed to be uncovered. Epistemological argument that discovering one lie justifies questioning entire knowledge system4:T51b,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning ship disappearing perspective. Shows Keanu Reeves as character from film with long dark brown messy hair, wearing white loose-fitting garment or shirt. Has confused, contemplative facial expression - mouth slightly open, eyes wide with puzzled look, eyebrows raised. Background blurred showing neutral beige-tan colors suggesting indoor setting. Top text in large white bold Impact font with black outline: 'WHAT IF SHIPS SAILING OVER THE HORIZON'. Bottom right corner shows small 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text: 'IS REALLY JUST PERSPECTIVE?' Uses Conspiracy Keanu meme format (originated 2011) depicting sudden realization or mind-blown conspiracy theory moment. Questions mainstream explanation that ships disappear hull-first over horizon due to Earth's curvature. Suggests alternative explanation: ships appear to sink due to perspective convergence and atmospheric effects rather than physical curve. Flat Earth argument claims with powerful zoom equipment (like Nikon P900 camera), ships can be brought back into view even after appearing to go over horizon, suggesting they never went behind curve but just became too small for naked eye to see. Challenges one of oldest and most cited proofs of spherical Earth dating back to ancient Greek observations5:T757,Lighthouse visibility argument challenging Earth curvature. Shows tall lighthouse photograph against light blue sky with white clouds. Lighthouse has distinctive tiered architecture - cylindrical red-brown brick base tower with multiple ornate balconies/galleries stacked vertically, topped with black metal lantern room and white dome cap. Seabirds flying around structure. Walkway/jetty extends from base into calm turquoise-blue ocean water. Upper left contains text block explaining flat Earth lighthouse argument: 'If, in fact, the earth were a round ball as is supposed, there is simply no way to explain how lighthouses can be seen from such great distances at sea. This phenomenon can be experienced by modern mariners today. The only interpretation of the phenomenon of being able to see lighthouses and other structures many miles out at sea is that the earth is flat. Knowledge of the fact are examples of lighthouses that could, in fact, be seen at great distances. Those lighthouses should have been well below the level curvature of the earth and thus out sight if the earth were round.' Second text block provides specific examples: 'The Egerø Light, on west point of Island, south coast of Norway, is fitted up with the first order of the dioptric lights, is visible 28 statute miles, and the altitude above high water is 154 feet. On making the proper calculation it will be found that this light ought to be sunk below the horizon 230 feet.' Third text block: 'The Dunkerque Light, on the south coast of France, is 194 feet high, and is visible 28 statute miles. The ordinary calculation shows that it ought to be 190 feet below the horizon.' Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Classic flat Earth argument claiming lighthouse visibility at distances exceeding predicted by Earth curvature calculations using standard formula 8 inches per mile squared0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-220","title":"Other 220","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12647412_457950707738002_7979581431822087631_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-219","title":"Other 219","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12647147_459883260878080_9003912119980330214_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-221","title":"Other 221","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654551_461814537351619_2880259156299938939_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
