5:T1362,Leonardo DiCaprio meme holding blank "proof list" suggesting no evidence exists for globe Earth. Photograph of actor Leonardo DiCaprio at formal event modified with text overlay to mock evidence for spherical Earth. DiCaprio stands in professional setting facing camera in three-quarter view, body slightly angled left, head turned toward camera with serious contemplative expression. He wears formal attire: black suit jacket, white dress shirt with collar open (no tie), creating semi-formal appearance. Dark blonde hair styled back in signature swept style. Facial hair shows light beard and mustache. Age appears late 30s to early 40s (photo likely from 2010s). Hands positioned holding large rectangular white paper/poster board at chest level - paper approximately 18"x24" size held portrait orientation. Background shows official/diplomatic setting: dark purple-blue backdrop with visible UN (United Nations) flag on right side - light blue flag showing UN emblem (world map surrounded by olive branches). Purple-blue curtains/drapes frame scene suggesting press conference or official UN event. Professional lighting illuminates subject evenly. DiCaprio is prominent climate change activist and UN Messenger of Peace, frequently speaks at UN climate conferences, making this appear to be authentic UN appearance photograph. White paper/board DiCaprio holds contains text in black sans-serif font centered near top: "HERE IS A LIST OF PROOFS FOR THE GLOBE" - title suggests comprehensive evidence catalog will follow. However, rest of paper is COMPLETELY BLANK - intentionally empty white space occupying ~80% of visible paper. Blank space is the joke's punchline: alleged "list of proofs" contains nothing, suggesting zero valid evidence exists for spherical Earth. Lower left corner shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme format uses blank list/empty page template to suggest something widely accepted has no supporting evidence - common rhetorical device in conspiracy communities. Applied to flat Earth specifically: mainstream claims Earth is sphere but supposedly cannot provide proof, leaving list empty. Intended message: despite widespread acceptance, scientific establishment has no actual evidence for globe Earth model. All supposed "proofs" are either misinterpreted observations, assumptions, or lies. Blank paper represents absence of genuine evidence. Using DiCaprio is strategic choice: 1) Celebrity known for passionate advocacy of scientific consensus on climate change, 2) Frequently appears at UN representing scientific community's positions, 3) His serious expression and formal setting add gravitas to joke, 4) Creates ironic contrast - voice of scientific establishment holding proof list with nothing on it. However, meme's premise is demonstrably false. Evidence for spherical Earth is extensive, ancient, and directly observable: 1) Ships disappear hull-first over horizon (visible to anyone at coast with binoculars), 2) Different star constellations visible from different hemispheres (try seeing Southern Cross from Canada), 3) Time zones exist because Earth rotates (sun can't be overhead everywhere simultaneously on flat plane), 4) Lunar eclipses show round Earth shadow on moon (only sphere casts round shadow from all angles), 5) Circumnavigation possible - travel continuously east or west and return to start, 6) Satellite imagery from multiple nations showing spherical Earth, 7) Photos from ISS (visible to naked eye crossing sky), 8) Gravity measurements consistent with spherical mass distribution, 9) Foucault pendulum demonstrates Earth's rotation, 10) Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns, ocean currents, 11) Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference in 240 BCE using stick shadows at different latitudes, 12) Modern GPS requires accounting for Earth's curvature - wouldn't work on flat plane, 13) Airplane flight paths and times make sense on globe but not flat map, 14) Seasons caused by Earth's axial tilt relative to sun, 15) Antarctic expeditions by multiple nations confirming continent isn't ice wall, 16) Amateur high-altitude balloon launches showing curvature at 100,000+ feet, 17) Horizon dip angle increases with altitude predictably for sphere. Evidence is not only abundant but replicable - anyone can personally verify many observations. Scientific consensus isn't maintained by absence of evidence but by overwhelming consistency of observations across all fields: astronomy, navigation, physics, geology, meteorology. Blank paper represents not absence of evidence, but flat Earthers' refusal to accept evidence. Psychological phenomenon: when beliefs are identity-based rather than evidence-based, contrary evidence gets dismissed or reinterpreted. Blank list meme allows believers to feel intellectually superior - "mainstream has nothing" - while avoiding engagement with actual extensive evidence. Format is rhetorical propaganda rather than logical argument.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 348 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Leonardo DiCaprio meme holding blank \"proof list\" suggesting no evidence exists for globe Earth.
