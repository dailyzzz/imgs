3:T1362,Leonardo DiCaprio meme holding blank "proof list" suggesting no evidence exists for globe Earth. Photograph of actor Leonardo DiCaprio at formal event modified with text overlay to mock evidence for spherical Earth. DiCaprio stands in professional setting facing camera in three-quarter view, body slightly angled left, head turned toward camera with serious contemplative expression. He wears formal attire: black suit jacket, white dress shirt with collar open (no tie), creating semi-formal appearance. Dark blonde hair styled back in signature swept style. Facial hair shows light beard and mustache. Age appears late 30s to early 40s (photo likely from 2010s). Hands positioned holding large rectangular white paper/poster board at chest level - paper approximately 18"x24" size held portrait orientation. Background shows official/diplomatic setting: dark purple-blue backdrop with visible UN (United Nations) flag on right side - light blue flag showing UN emblem (world map surrounded by olive branches). Purple-blue curtains/drapes frame scene suggesting press conference or official UN event. Professional lighting illuminates subject evenly. DiCaprio is prominent climate change activist and UN Messenger of Peace, frequently speaks at UN climate conferences, making this appear to be authentic UN appearance photograph. White paper/board DiCaprio holds contains text in black sans-serif font centered near top: "HERE IS A LIST OF PROOFS FOR THE GLOBE" - title suggests comprehensive evidence catalog will follow. However, rest of paper is COMPLETELY BLANK - intentionally empty white space occupying ~80% of visible paper. Blank space is the joke's punchline: alleged "list of proofs" contains nothing, suggesting zero valid evidence exists for spherical Earth. Lower left corner shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme format uses blank list/empty page template to suggest something widely accepted has no supporting evidence - common rhetorical device in conspiracy communities. Applied to flat Earth specifically: mainstream claims Earth is sphere but supposedly cannot provide proof, leaving list empty. Intended message: despite widespread acceptance, scientific establishment has no actual evidence for globe Earth model. All supposed "proofs" are either misinterpreted observations, assumptions, or lies. Blank paper represents absence of genuine evidence. Using DiCaprio is strategic choice: 1) Celebrity known for passionate advocacy of scientific consensus on climate change, 2) Frequently appears at UN representing scientific community's positions, 3) His serious expression and formal setting add gravitas to joke, 4) Creates ironic contrast - voice of scientific establishment holding proof list with nothing on it. However, meme's premise is demonstrably false. Evidence for spherical Earth is extensive, ancient, and directly observable: 1) Ships disappear hull-first over horizon (visible to anyone at coast with binoculars), 2) Different star constellations visible from different hemispheres (try seeing Southern Cross from Canada), 3) Time zones exist because Earth rotates (sun can't be overhead everywhere simultaneously on flat plane), 4) Lunar eclipses show round Earth shadow on moon (only sphere casts round shadow from all angles), 5) Circumnavigation possible - travel continuously east or west and return to start, 6) Satellite imagery from multiple nations showing spherical Earth, 7) Photos from ISS (visible to naked eye crossing sky), 8) Gravity measurements consistent with spherical mass distribution, 9) Foucault pendulum demonstrates Earth's rotation, 10) Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns, ocean currents, 11) Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference in 240 BCE using stick shadows at different latitudes, 12) Modern GPS requires accounting for Earth's curvature - wouldn't work on flat plane, 13) Airplane flight paths and times make sense on globe but not flat map, 14) Seasons caused by Earth's axial tilt relative to sun, 15) Antarctic expeditions by multiple nations confirming continent isn't ice wall, 16) Amateur high-altitude balloon launches showing curvature at 100,000+ feet, 17) Horizon dip angle increases with altitude predictably for sphere. Evidence is not only abundant but replicable - anyone can personally verify many observations. Scientific consensus isn't maintained by absence of evidence but by overwhelming consistency of observations across all fields: astronomy, navigation, physics, geology, meteorology. Blank paper represents not absence of evidence, but flat Earthers' refusal to accept evidence. Psychological phenomenon: when beliefs are identity-based rather than evidence-based, contrary evidence gets dismissed or reinterpreted. Blank list meme allows believers to feel intellectually superior - "mainstream has nothing" - while avoiding engagement with actual extensive evidence. Format is rhetorical propaganda rather than logical argument.4:T131f,Anthropomorphized globe Earth graduation meme rejecting re-education about spherical Earth. 3D rendered cartoon image showing globe Earth character as frustrated graduate tired of being lectured about spherical Earth model. Center of frame shows computer-generated Earth globe given humanoid characteristics - spherical body showing realistic satellite photography of Earth's surface with blue oceans (navy blue), green landmasses (North America visible on left, South America below, Europe and Africa on right side), white cloud formations swirling across surface creating realistic weather patterns. Earth rendered with accurate geography and cloud textures. Globe has cartoon limbs attached: two blue arms extending from sides, two blue legs extending from bottom, all rendered in solid navy blue color suggesting ocean water as material. Arms and legs show simple cartoon styling - cylindrical shapes with rounded joints suggesting elbows/knees, ending in mitten-like hands and simple feet. Limbs positioned to suggest body language: left arm raised holding diploma scroll, right arm hanging down, legs standing in neutral stance on invisible ground. Entire figure appears as Earth standing upright as character. Atop Earth sits black graduation cap (mortarboard) - traditional square academic cap with flat board on top and tassel hanging from right side. Cap positioned as if sitting on "head" (North Pole area). Cap signifies educational achievement/graduation. Right hand/arm holds rolled diploma/degree - white cylindrical scroll tied with red ribbon band marked "JM" in white letters (possibly initials, could reference creator or be generic decoration). Diploma signifies completion of education program. Background shows white space with light blue watermark diagonally across lower left reading "fb.com/fematters" in semi-transparent text. Figure casts soft shadow below suggesting three-dimensional rendering with lighting from above/front. Text overlays in large bold white letters with thick black outlines for readability: top text spanning image width reads "EVERY FLAT EARTHER USED TO BELIEVE THEY WERE ON A GLOBE" - acknowledging flat Earth believers' past acceptance of mainstream education. Bottom text reads "STOP TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO US AGAIN" - exasperated request to cease re-education attempts. Meme addresses common interaction between flat Earth believers and mainstream individuals: globe believers often attempt to "educate" flat Earthers by explaining basic astronomy, physics, evidence for spherical Earth. Flat Earthers find this patronizing because they already learned globe Earth model in school (represented by graduation cap and diploma). Message: "We're not ignorant of your model - we learned it, graduated with it, but have since rejected it based on our own research. Stop treating us like we simply don't understand the globe model - we understand it, we just believe it's wrong." Graduation imagery emphasizes: 1) Flat Earthers are educated people who completed standard schooling, 2) They're not lacking knowledge of globe Earth theory, 3) Their rejection comes AFTER learning mainstream view, not from ignorance, 4) They feel condescended to when people re-explain concepts they already know. Frustrated anthropomorphized Earth character represents flat Earthers' perspective: they see themselves as Earth holding diploma in "globe Earth education" but having moved beyond that framework to "truth" of flat Earth. Irony: image uses globe Earth rendering to represent flat Earthers' former belief, making visual joke work through contrast. Psychological pattern common in conspiracy communities: believers often describe awakening journey from accepting mainstream narrative to questioning and eventually rejecting it. Frame themselves as more educated than average person because they've learned both perspectives (mainstream + alternative) while critics only know mainstream. "Do your own research" ethos positions them as independent thinkers versus "indoctrinated" masses. However, scientific literacy involves more than knowing claims exist - requires understanding scientific method, evaluating evidence quality, distinguishing between tested theories and speculation. Flat Earthers typically misunderstand physics principles they claim to have "researched" - gravity, perspective, scale, inertial reference frames. Educational background in mainstream sense (graduation) doesn't guarantee scientific literacy or critical thinking skills. Many with formal education still fall for logical fallacies, confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect. Meme effective in flat Earth communities because validates feeling of being dismissed or patronized. Creates in-group solidarity: "They don't understand that WE understand THEM, but they don't understand US." Positions movement as intellectually sophisticated rather than scientifically illiterate.5:T14ce,Neil deGrasse Tyson pear-shaped Earth visual pun meme with actual pears. Professional portrait photograph of astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson modified with text to mock his statement about Earth being pear-shaped. Image shows formal studio portrait with clean gradient background - teal-green-blue gradient fading from darker at edges to lighter in center creating professional headshot aesthetic. Tyson sits facing camera in relaxed but dignified pose - body slightly turned, upper body and hands visible. He wears formal business attire: dark navy blue three-piece suit (jacket, vest, trousers) with crisp white dress shirt and distinctive necktie featuring space/astronomy theme - tie shows dark blue background with nebula patterns, stars, cosmic imagery appropriate for renowned astrophysicist. Suit fits well showing professional tailoring. Tyson's hands positioned holding white dinner plate at waist/chest level presenting contents toward camera. On plate sit three green pears - Bartlett or Anjou pears with characteristic pyriform (pear) shape, green-yellow skin showing natural coloring and subtle brown spotting, stems still attached pointing upward. Pears arranged artfully on plate creating still-life composition. Tyson's facial expression shows slight knowing smile with raised eyebrows suggesting amusement or playfulness - expression could be interpreted as presenting something significant or offering pears literally. His distinctive features visible: mustache, goatee, characteristic friendly demeanor. Professional studio lighting illuminates subject evenly with soft shadows. Text overlay at top in large sans-serif font: "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" in light gray or white letters creating title/context. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Visual pun operates on multiple levels: 1) Tyson famously stated Earth is "pear-shaped" referring to scientific fact that Earth is oblate spheroid (flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation) with additional asymmetry where Southern Hemisphere's equatorial bulge is slightly larger than Northern Hemisphere's (measured difference of ~20 meters). Term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid. 2) Meme takes Tyson's technical statement literally by showing him holding actual pears - visual joke suggesting if Earth is "pear-shaped" according to scientist, here are pears to represent it. Mockery suggests claim is absurd by literalizing metaphor. 3) Flat Earth community frequently targets Tyson (along with Bill Nye) as prominent science communicators defending mainstream cosmology. His pear-Earth statement became focal point for mockery because awkward phrasing made accurate science sound ridiculous to lay audience. Presenting actual pears frames scientific statement as nonsensical. However, Tyson's statement was scientifically accurate: precise measurements from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites show Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - equatorial radius at Southern Hemisphere approximately 20 meters greater than Northern Hemisphere at equatorial plane. This deviation from perfect oblate spheroid creates very slight "pear" asymmetry. Difference is real, measurable, and scientifically significant for understanding Earth's mass distribution and gravitational field variations, though imperceptible to naked eye from space. Earth's oblateness itself (polar vs equatorial diameter difference of 43 km out of 12,742 km diameter = 0.33%) results from centrifugal force due to rotation - fundamental physics principle. Tyson's use of "pear-shaped" was popularization attempt to explain technical concept to general audience, but backfired by creating misleading mental image. Better description: "very slightly asymmetric oblate spheroid." Meme's humor exploits communication failure - technically correct statement that sounds absurd when taken literally. Photograph appears to be manipulated - Tyson likely photographed for different purpose, pears digitally added or composite created. His expression and body language suggest formal portrait rather than deliberately posing with pears. Professional photography quality and composition indicate stock portrait or publicity photo. Effectiveness in flat Earth communities stems from: 1) Ridiculing prominent science advocate, 2) Suggesting mainstream scientists make obviously ridiculous claims, 3) Implies globe Earth model is inconsistent ("first it's sphere, then oblate spheroid, now pear-shaped - make up your mind"), 4) Visual humor makes message shareable and memorable. Irony: meme mocks accurate science by presenting literal interpretation of metaphor, while flat Earth model contradicts overwhelming evidence from navigation, astronomy, physics. Tyson has addressed pear-Earth controversy multiple times, clarifying measurement precision and explaining why Earth's shape deviates slightly from perfect sphere while emphasizing overall sphericity. Scientific understanding requires precision - Earth is sphere to first approximation, oblate spheroid to second approximation, asymmetric oblate spheroid to third approximation. Each refinement represents increased measurement precision, not contradiction of previous understanding.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-348","title":"Other 348","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12805916_471298773069862_3171689689267286590_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-347","title":"Other 347","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12805899_472789329587473_298723809762868996_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-349","title":"Other 349","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806013_470535606479512_6280776372523264957_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
