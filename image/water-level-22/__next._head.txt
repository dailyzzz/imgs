5:T430,Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at viewer. Top text reads 'POUR WATER INTO A CUP IT BECOMES THE CUP. POUR IT INTO A TEAPOT IT BECOMES THE TEAPOT.' Bottom text states 'POUR WATER ONTO A BALL....IT FALLS OFF.' References Bruce Lee's famous philosophical quote 'Be like water, my friend' about water's adaptability taking shape of its container. Original quote celebrates water's flexibility and formlessness. Meme adds humorous/argumentative twist by extending analogy to spherical Earth: while water adapts to shape of containers (cup, teapot), it cannot remain on curved surface of ball due to gravity causing it to fall off. Argues this observable property of water (runs off curved surfaces) contradicts spherical Earth model where oceans supposedly adhere to curved planet. Uses Bruce Lee's water philosophy ironically to support flat Earth argument - water's tendency to seek level and flow downward means it cannot stick to outside of spinning ball0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 22 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at vie..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Water Level 22"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at vie..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/water-level/53723677_10156623770049807_1899431273563160576_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Water Level 22"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at vie..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/water-level/53723677_10156623770049807_1899431273563160576_n.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
