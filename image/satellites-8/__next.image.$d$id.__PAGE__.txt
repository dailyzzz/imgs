Top text in white: '\"IF SATELLITES EXISTED, YOU WOULDN'T NEED AN AIRPLANE FOR PICTURES.\"' followed by attribution '-DR. JAMES MAC, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE'. Image shows Predator-style unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with distinctive long wings, propeller, landing gear deployed, and 'Google' branding on fuselage. Number '47-3614' visible on side. Suggests military and commercial aerial photography/surveillance is conducted by high-altitude aircraft and drones rather than orbital satellites. Implies Department of Defense source admits satellites unnecessary for reconnaissance imagery when aircraft can perform same function, questioning satellite existence or capability claims."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-7","title":"Satellites 7","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37265703_10160438868435532_1665488326255181824_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme challenging satellite necessity. Top panel shows workers on ship deck working with thick undersea cables, text: 'If the earth is round & we have 1000's of satellites orbiting the earth' with workers wearing hard hats (yellow, white, red) handling large black cables with yellow/gold striping on green deck. Bottom panel shows industrial cable spool machinery on dock or ship, large blue cable reel mounted on frame with cable feeding equipment, text: 'Why do we need over 250 undersea cables spanning continent to continent?' Argues that extensive undersea fiber optic cable infrastructure for global telecommunications contradicts claimed reliance on satellite network, questioning whether satellites are necessary or even exist if physical cables handle communication."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-9","title":"Satellites 9","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/37300469_10160438869675532_4515830233940623360_n.jpeg","description":"Three-panel meme questioning ISS visibility.

Argues if football field is invisible from orbital altitude, ISS of comparable size shouldn't be visible to naked eye from ground despite reported sightings."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
