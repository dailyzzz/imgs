3:T41a,Statistical probability comparison meme with playing cards image. Hand holding playing cards showing royal flush (Ace through 10 of hearts) against green card table background. Three probability statements in white text: 'The probability of getting FIVE royal flushes in a row is 0.000000000000000000000000668157876' with exponent notation '14352475950670290899384801%. If that happened, you would reasonably conclude that the game is somehow rigged.' Second: 'The probability of functional sequence of amino acids in several known proteins arising from chance is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%, or 1 in 10^63.' Third: 'The probability of a functional simple cell to arise without intelligent design, given all the ingredients is 1 in 10^57600!' Uses extremely low probability comparisons to argue biological complexity requires intelligent design, claiming random chance cannot explain protein formation or cellular origin, comparing it to impossibly unlikely card game scenarios that would indicate rigging.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-4","title":"Pseudo Science 4","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/17308747_10212770846294202_4612703730941144270_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-3","title":"Pseudo Science 3","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/16143146_10212397816360942_4280357342415459445_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with photograph of antique brass compass on aged map with sepia tones. Top text in white: 'A COMPASS MUST BE HELD FLAT TO WORK...'

Bottom text: 'Compasses always point north... ALWAYS... So which way is north on the bottom of a ball?' Argues compass navigation only makes sense on flat Earth model where magnetic north pole is at center, questioning how compasses function in Southern Hemisphere if Earth is spherical since 'north' direction would vary depending on position on globe.

Top left shows woman at microphone/podium with speech bubble 'I'm a GIRL!' Top right shows Bill Nye the Science Guy in bow tie with speech bubble 'I'm a Scientist!' Bottom panel shows rusted deteriorated vintage car (appears to be 1970s sedan) with wood paneling missing, rust, damage, on brick patio, with speech bubble 'And I'M a Lamborghini!' Bottom text: 'Come on people!!! You HAVE to call Bullshit at some point!' Uses absurdist comparison: if someone can identify as different gender, by same logic rusted old car could identify as luxury Lamborghini. Satirical critique of gender identity concepts by comparing to obviously false material claim, arguing there must be objective limits to self-identification that contradict physical reality."}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
