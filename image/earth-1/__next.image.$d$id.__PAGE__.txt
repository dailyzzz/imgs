Dramatic perspective photograph displays hundreds of ornate stone pillars extending into distance, creating perfect vanishing point symmetry. Pillars feature intricate carved details on capitals and bases. Stone floor path leads between parallel rows of columns under wooden beam ceiling. Top text: 'All 1212 pillars meet in one dot. Built by engineers 1740 years back'. Bottom text: 'Rameshwaram temple.' Watermark: 'channel 42'. Highlights extraordinary mathematical precision and engineering sophistication of ancient Indian architecture, arguing advanced technical knowledge predated modern tools and surveying equipment. Often used to suggest lost ancient technologies or superior knowledge of geometry and optics in pre-modern civilizations"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
