13:T1b55,News article screenshot showing "FLAT EARTH" graffiti vandalism on Burnham-on-Sea seawall in England, with mayor expressing dismay. Local news coverage of two-metre tall flat Earth graffiti spray-painted on coastal wall, shared by flat Earth community as example of movement's visibility and public presence. Article documents real-world flat Earth activism through vandalism while authorities express disapproval. ARTICLE HEADER: Headline reads "Mayor's dismay at two-metre tall graffiti daubed on Burnham's sea wall" - Local official reacting negatively to vandalism. Subheading establishes location and describes damage. Source identified as Burnham-On-Sea.com News - local online news outlet covering Somerset, England coastal town. MAIN PHOTOGRAPH: Image shows concrete sea wall along beach with large white spray-painted text reading "FLAT EARTH" in capital letters approximately two metres (6.5 feet) tall. Graffiti clearly visible from distance, professionally photographed for news article. Location is Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, England - seaside resort town on Bristol Channel coast. SEAWALL STRUCTURE: Concrete defensive wall protecting town from tidal flooding. Wall appears gray concrete with vertical supports/buttresses at regular intervals. Horizontal surface along top forms walkway. Beach visible in foreground - sandy with some wave patterns visible. Wall extends across image showing substantial structure. GRAFFITI DETAILS: White paint letters spelling "FLAT EARTH" in rough hand-painted style typical of graffiti. Letters appear hastily applied but legible from considerable distance. Two-metre height makes statement highly visible to beach visitors and seafront pedestrians. Paint appears fresh in photograph suggesting recent application. Style is basic block letters without artistic elaboration - functional messaging rather than artistic graffiti. BACKGROUND BUILDINGS: Behind seawall, Victorian/Edwardian era buildings visible - typical British seaside architecture including what appears to be hotel or large residential building with distinctive towers/turrets. Multiple stories with traditional English coastal resort character. Buildings suggest established resort town with historic seafront development. ARTICLE CONTEXT: Local mayor quoted expressing "dismay" at vandalism - official disapproval of property damage. Article treats incident as minor local crime story rather than discussion of flat Earth beliefs. Focus on vandalism aspect and cleanup costs rather than legitimacy of flat Earth claims. News coverage frames flat Earthers as vandals damaging public property, not as truth-seekers spreading important message. FLAT EARTH COMMUNITY RESPONSE: Screenshot shared by flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters attribution visible) celebrating visibility of message. Sharing news coverage serves multiple purposes: 1) Shows flat Earth message reaching mainstream media. 2) Demonstrates dedicated believers taking action. 3) Creates sense of growing movement willing to act publicly. 4) Frames negative coverage as publicity regardless of tone. Any press is good press mentality. VANDALISM AS ACTIVISM: Graffiti represents extreme end of flat Earth activism spectrum. Most flat Earth activity is online (social media, YouTube, forums), but some believers engage in real-world actions: attending conferences, creating signs, producing merchandise, and occasionally vandalism. Public graffiti aims to: Plant seeds of doubt in passersby. Demonstrate conviction (risk of legal consequences shows dedication). Create talking point and news coverage. Mark territory/claim public space for message. Recruit curious observers who research after seeing message. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS: Graffiti vandalism is criminal offense in UK. Perpetrator could face: Criminal damage charges, fines, community service, potential imprisonment for serious cases. Cleanup costs passed to local council (taxpayers). Negative publicity for flat Earth movement among general public who view vandalism negatively. Most people seeing this would think "vandals" not "truth-tellers." EFFECTIVENESS DEBATE: Within flat Earth community, opinions on activism tactics vary. Some applaud bold public action, others worry vandalism creates negative associations. Mainstream audiences likely view graffiti negatively regardless of message content. News coverage focuses on crime/cleanup rather than message legitimacy. May attract attention but probably not positive conversion. Comparison to other movements: Environmental activists, political protesters sometimes use graffiti - debatable effectiveness for any cause. GEOGRAPHIC CONTEXT: Burnham-on-Sea is small town (population ~20,000) in Somerset, southwest England. Seaside location with traditional beach tourism. Sea wall is protective infrastructure and public amenity. Flat Earth graffiti here suggests either: Local flat Earth believer taking action, or traveling activist choosing visible seaside location. Irony: Flat Earthers chose sea wall - structure built to protect against ocean tides that exist because of gravitational effects on spherical Earth's water. Sea walls designed using engineering that assumes spherical Earth model. VISUAL DOCUMENTATION: News photograph serves as documentation of incident. Clear image showing extent of vandalism, location context, readable text. Professional journalism quality suggesting established local news outlet. Image widely shareable for both those condemning vandalism and those celebrating message spread. BURNHAM-ON-SEA.COM: Local news website covering Somerset coast area. URL shown indicates source. Local online journalism providing community news. Covering this as local interest story about vandalism rather than national story about flat Earth movement. Indicates incident considered minor local crime rather than significant cultural moment. FLAT EARTH SUBCULTURE: Image demonstrates flat Earth movement extends beyond online spaces into physical world. Believers motivated enough to risk legal consequences for public messaging. Movement has dedicated activists, not just passive internet commenters. However, vandalism tactics may alienate potential converts and reinforce perception of flat Earthers as fringe extremists rather than reasonable questioners. MEDIA FRAMING: Notice how article frames story - "Mayor's dismay" emphasizes negative official reaction. "Graffiti daubed" uses verb with negative connotations (daubed = applied carelessly). Focus on size (two-metre) emphasizes scale of damage. No discussion of flat Earth claims' validity. Message treated as vandalism content rather than debatable assertion. This framing typical of mainstream coverage - flat Earth treated as self-evidently absurd, focus on social disruption rather than intellectual debate. Attribution: fb.com/fematters watermark indicates flat Earth community sharing news coverage as evidence of their movement's real-world presence and mainstream media attention, regardless of negative framing.14:T1bba,NASA Earth images comparison claiming inconsistency between Blue Marble photographs proves images are computer-generated simulations, not real photographs. Grid layout comparing official NASA Earth images from different dates with simulated globe renderings, suggesting NASA fabricates Earth imagery because continent sizes appear different. Flat Earth argument that Earth photos are CGI/Photoshop, not genuine photographs from space. IMAGE LAYOUT: Seven globe images arranged in grid format against black background. Left column labeled "NASA VERSION" shows two official NASA photographs. Right section shows five "simulation" globes for comparison. Explanatory text at top right reads: "Simulation of the globe on the dates the images were taken and remastered." LEFT COLUMN - NASA IMAGES: TOP LEFT GLOBE: Labeled "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972 01/04/2012" - Famous "Blue Marble" photograph from Apollo 17 mission (December 7, 1972) compared with 2012 image. Shows Earth with Africa prominently visible, blue oceans, white cloud formations. This is one of most famous photographs ever taken - full Earth illuminated by sun behind camera during Apollo 17's journey to moon. Image shows Earth from approximately 28,000 miles away. Classic view with Africa, Arabia, Antarctica visible. BOTTOM LEFT GLOBE: Another NASA Earth image, appearing similar to top image but potentially different date/source. Shows similar view of Africa-centered hemisphere with cloud patterns and ocean colors. Both NASA images show blue planet with recognizable continental shapes, white clouds, atmospheric haze at edges. RIGHT SECTION - SIMULATION COMPARISON: Five computer-generated globe models showing Earth on specific dates for comparison with NASA photographs. Row 1: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - simulations showing expected appearance on dates NASA images were supposedly taken. Row 2: "THE GLOBE ON 12/07/1972" and "THE GLOBE ON 01/04/2012" - additional simulation views. Simulations appear to use satellite/map data projected onto sphere to show expected Earth appearance on specific dates. PURPOSE OF COMPARISON: Image creator attempts to show discrepancies between NASA photographs and computer simulations of Earth on same dates. Implication: If NASA photos were genuine, they should exactly match simulations of Earth's appearance. Any differences suggest NASA photos are fabricated/manipulated. Flat Earth community argues NASA images show Africa at different sizes, continent shapes vary between photos, cloud patterns impossible, etc. - "proving" images are computer-generated rather than genuine photographs. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NASA LIES: Space agency fabricates imagery rather than photographing real spherical Earth (which flat Earthers believe doesn't exist). All "Earth from space" photos are CGI, Photoshop, composites, or studio shots. 2) INCONSISTENCY PROVES FAKERY: If Earth photos were real, they'd be consistent. Variations between images (continent size, color, cloud patterns) prove manipulation. Real photographs would show identical planet; CGI introduces errors. 3) TECHNOLOGY WASN'T AVAILABLE: In 1972, digital manipulation wasn't possible, but flat Earthers claim photos were faked using other techniques (paintings, models, studio work). Modern images are CGI because technology now exists. 4) BLUE MARBLE ADMITTED COMPOSITE: NASA has stated that many modern Earth images are composites from multiple satellite passes stitched together. Flat Earthers interpret any compositing as proof of total fakery - if any manipulation occurs, entire image is fabricated. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) DIFFERENT DISTANCES/PERSPECTIVES: Earth photos from different distances show continents at different apparent sizes due to perspective. Apollo 17 was ~28,000 miles from Earth; satellites orbit at various altitudes (250-22,000+ miles). Closer = different perspective on curved surface. 2) CAMERA/LENS DIFFERENCES: Different cameras, lenses, focal lengths produce different results. Fish-eye vs telephoto lenses change apparent curvature and proportion. Comparing images from different cameras isn't valid test of authenticity. 3) ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS: Cloud cover, atmospheric clarity, lighting angle all change Earth's appearance. No two photographs of Earth will be identical because conditions constantly change. Demanding identical images misunderstands photography. 4) COMPOSITE VS FAKE: Yes, some NASA images are composites - multiple photos stitched together for higher resolution or to show features normally not visible together. Composite is standard photographic technique, not evidence of fabrication. Panoramic photos, HDR images, focus stacking are all "composites" - doesn't make them fake. 5) MULTIPLE SOURCES: Earth images come from NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China), ISRO (India), Roscosmos (Russia), private companies (SpaceX, Planet Labs), amateur radio operators, weather balloons, etc. Would require global conspiracy among competing/adversarial nations to all produce consistent "fake" spherical Earth images. 6) LIVE FEEDS: ISS provides live video feed showing Earth. Weather satellites provide continuous imagery. These aren't single photos that could be fabricated - they're ongoing streams matching weather patterns, day/night cycles, seasonal changes in real time. 7) YOU CAN VERIFY: Amateur astronomers photograph ISS passing overhead. High-altitude balloon enthusiasts photograph Earth's curvature. Anyone with sufficient resources can launch balloon camera and see curvature themselves. No reliance on NASA required. SPECIFIC IMAGE ANALYSIS: The 1972 Blue Marble is genuine photograph taken by astronauts on film camera during Apollo 17 mission. Original film exists, has been examined, shows no evidence of manipulation. Africa appears "large" because camera was positioned to center Africa in frame - this is normal perspective effect when photographing sphere up close. Claiming Africa looks "different size" in different photos fails to account for: distance from Earth, camera position, lens focal length, and perspective geometry of photographing curved surfaces. ATTRIBUTION: "fb.com/aterraeplana" visible in bottom left - Portuguese flat Earth community page (terra plana = flat earth in Portuguese). Indicates this is flat Earth propaganda image designed to cast doubt on NASA imagery by creating false expectation that all Earth photos should look identical regardless of when, where, and how they were taken. VISUAL RHETORIC: Grid layout suggests systematic comparison/analysis. Side-by-side format implies equivalence between NASA photos and simulations. Labeling with specific dates creates impression of scientific rigor. But comparison is fundamentally flawed - expecting photographs taken under different conditions to be identical demonstrates misunderstanding of photography, perspective, and the physical process of imaging a sphere from different distances and angles. Image designed to create doubt through apparent inconsistency while ignoring explanations for normal variation between photographs.15:T215c,Pirates of the Caribbean meme with Captain Jack Sparrow using telescope, sarcastically asking if telescope can "drag ship back over the curve of the Earth." Flat Earth meme using movie screenshot to mock globe Earth explanation that ships disappearing over horizon can be "brought back" by zooming with telescope or camera. Image presents flat Earth argument that if ships disappear due to curvature, magnification shouldn't be able to restore visibility. MOVIE STILL: Screenshot from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise showing two characters on ship or dock. Scene appears to be from first film "The Curse of the Black Pearl" (2003) or early sequel. Characters positioned looking out over water - appropriate context for ship-watching/telescope use. LEFT CHARACTER - CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW: Iconic Johnny Depp portrayal of eccentric pirate captain. Distinctive appearance: Dark dreadlocked hair with beads and trinkets woven throughout. Bandana/headscarf covering top of head. Thick black eyeliner/kohl around eyes - characteristic Jack Sparrow look. Facial hair including mustache and small goatee. Weather-worn skin suggesting life at sea. Holding BRASS TELESCOPE to eye, looking through it toward horizon. Classic nautical pose of captain scanning for ships. Expression partially obscured by telescope but appears focused. Wearing typical Jack Sparrow costume - period pirate attire with multiple layers. RIGHT CHARACTER - WILL TURNER: Orlando Bloom's character - young blacksmith turned pirate. Clean-cut appearance contrasting with Jack Sparrow's disheveled look. Dark hair pulled back. Lighter skin, youthful features. White/cream colored shirt typical of period costume. Looking toward Jack with expression suggesting skepticism or confusion. Standing close, observing Jack's telescope use. Character dynamic suggests questioning or conversation between the two. WATER BACKGROUND: Ocean/sea visible behind characters. Horizon line where water meets sky. Blue-gray water stretching to distance. Scene likely set in Caribbean waters based on film setting. This maritime context makes image relevant to flat Earth ship-over-horizon discussions. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text in white Impact font with black outline reads: "SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU CAN DRAG THAT SHIP BACK OVER THE CURVE OF THE EARTH WITH NOTHING BUT THAT MAGIC TELESCOPE?" Sarcastic question format mocking globe Earth proponents who claim zooming in can restore visibility of ships that disappeared over horizon. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SHIPS DISAPPEAR BOTTOM-FIRST: Globe Earth proponents cite ships disappearing hull-first over horizon as evidence of Earth's curvature. Bottom disappears before mast because curvature progressively blocks lower portions from view. 2) ZOOM BRINGS SHIPS BACK: Flat Earthers counter that zooming with telescope, binoculars, or camera can often "bring back" ships that appeared to disappear. If ship truly went "over" curve, no amount of magnification should restore it. But zoom does work (sometimes), therefore Earth isn't curved, ships just got too far for naked eye to see. 3) "MAGIC TELESCOPE" SARCASM: Meme mocks globe Earth explanation by sarcastically calling telescope "magic" - implying globe believers must invoke magical properties to explain how zoom works. If Earth were curved, telescope couldn't see over/around curve. Since zoom does reveal ships, either Earth is flat or telescope has magical curve-bending powers. 4) PERSPECTIVE VS CURVATURE: Flat Earth explanation is that ships disappear due to perspective/angular resolution limits of human eye, not curvature. At sufficient distance, objects become too small to resolve. Magnification (telescope) increases angular size, making distant objects visible again. No curve involved - just perspective limits at extreme distances. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) ANGULAR RESOLUTION: Human eye does have limited angular resolution (~1 arcminute). Distant objects appear smaller due to perspective. Eventually object appears so small it's below eye's resolution limit - appears to vanish even though still technically visible if magnified. This is real phenomenon. 2) BUT ALSO CURVATURE: Earth's curvature ADDITIONALLY blocks objects at distance. At sea level, horizon is approximately 3 miles away. Beyond horizon, objects are physically blocked by Earth's curve - not just too small to see. These are separate phenomena that both occur. 3) BOTTOM-FIRST DISAPPEARANCE: If only perspective mattered, entire ship would shrink uniformly and fade away. Instead, ships disappear BOTTOM-FIRST - hull vanishes while mast remains visible. This proves curvature blocking, not just perspective shrinking. Magnification cannot bring back bottom portion already blocked by curve. 4) PARTIAL RESTORATION: Sometimes zooming PARTIALLY restores ship visibility because: Ship wasn't fully beyond curve yet (only appeared to vanish due to angular resolution); Atmospheric refraction bent light over curve (temporarily); Ship was in atmospheric mirage zone; Observer was viewing ship that appeared to sink but was still above geometric horizon. But once ship is truly beyond curve, no magnification restores it. 5) PREDICTABLE MATHEMATICS: Distance to horizon and amount of curvature drop are precisely calculable. At any given observer height and target distance, exact amount of object blocked by curve is predictable. These calculations match observations perfectly, confirming both Earth's radius and spherical geometry. 6) REPEATABLE EXPERIMENTS: Multiple controlled experiments have documented ships, buildings, landmarks disappearing bottom-first at predicted distances, with magnification unable to restore blocked portions. Bedford Level experiment, Lake Pontchartrain causeway observations, and many others confirm curvature effects as distinct from perspective effects. MEME FORMAT ANALYSIS: Using popular movie characters makes meme engaging and shareable. Jack Sparrow associated with cleverness, seeing through deception - suggesting flat Earthers are similarly perceptive. Will Turner's skeptical expression represents globe believer being challenged. Question format invites viewer to consider "gotcha" argument. Sarcasm ("magic telescope") mocks opposition as believing absurdities. Effective for in-group humor but misrepresents actual science of perspective vs curvature. CHARACTER CHOICE: Jack Sparrow is sympathetic anti-hero - clever, unconventional thinker who sees truths others miss. Perfect avatar for flat Earthers who see themselves as independent thinkers challenging mainstream dogma. Pirates as outsiders questioning authority parallels flat Earth self-image as truth-seekers challenging scientific establishment. Telescope prop is convenient for ship-watching topic. Will Turner represents naive believer being educated by wiser Jack - meme positions flat Earther as wise teacher, globe believer as confused student. IMGFLIP WATERMARK: Small "imgflip.com" watermark visible in lower left indicates meme created using Imgflip meme generator - popular online tool for creating image macros. Suggests meme created by amateur rather than professional content producer. Typical of grassroots flat Earth content creation. VISUAL RHETORIC: Movie still provides emotional/narrative context that pure text argument lacks. Viewers familiar with Pirates films bring positive associations with characters. Format is immediately recognizable as internet meme - genre signals humor/satire rather than serious argument. Works as "thought-terminating" content - instead of researching perspective vs curvature, viewer remembers funny meme and dismisses globe Earth explanation as absurd. Attribution: fb.com/fematters watermark identifies flat Earth community source. Content designed to mock globe Earth proponents and provide shareable argument for flat Earth believers. FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING: Meme conflates two separate phenomena (perspective limits and curvature blocking) and presents telescope success in overcoming perspective limits as disproving curvature. But these are independent effects. Telescope CAN overcome perspective limits (making small things appear larger). Telescope CANNOT overcome curvature blocking (cannot see around/over physical obstruction). Flat Earthers document cases where zoom helped (perspective was limiting factor) and ignore cases where zoom failed (curvature was blocking factor). Cherry-picking confirms flat Earth belief while actual controlled experiments confirm both phenomena exist and match spherical Earth predictions.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-383","title":"Other 383","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12924439_485877088278697_5816571113015467364_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-382","title":"Other 382","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12923279_481720352027704_2274777867548518658_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-384","title":"Other 384","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12931101_485904108275995_1625534449377818811_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

Sea walls designed using engineering that assumes spherical Earth model. VISUAL DOCUMENTATION: News photograph serves as documentation of incident. Clear image showing extent of vandalism, location context, readable text. Professional journalism quality suggesting established local news outlet. Image widely shareable for both those condemning vandalism and those celebrating message spread. BURNHAM-ON-SEA.COM: Local news website covering Somerset coast area. URL shown indicates source. Local online journalism providing community news. Covering this as local interest story about vandalism rather than national story about flat Earth movement. Indicates incident considered minor local crime rather than significant cultural moment. FLAT EARTH SUBCULTURE: Image demonstrates flat Earth movement extends beyond online spaces into physical world. Believers motivated enough to risk legal consequences for public messaging. Movement has dedicated activists, not just passive internet commenters. However, vandalism tactics may alienate potential converts and reinforce perception of flat Earthers as fringe extremists rather than reasonable questioners. MEDIA FRAMING: Notice how article frames story - "Mayor's dismay" emphasizes negative official reaction. "Graffiti daubed" uses verb with negative connotations (daubed = applied carelessly). Focus on size (two-metre) emphasizes scale of damage. No discussion of flat Earth claims' validity. Message treated as vandalism content rather than debatable assertion. This framing typical of mainstream coverage - flat Earth treated as self-evidently absurd, focus on social disruption rather than intellectual debate. Attribution: fb.com/fematters watermark indicates flat Earth community sharing news coverage as evidence of their movement's real-world presence and mainstream media attention, regardless of negative framing.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 383 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"News article screenshot showing \"FLAT EARTH\" graffiti vandalism on Burnham-on-Sea seawall in England, with mayor expressing dismay.
