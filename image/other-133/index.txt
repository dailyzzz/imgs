13:T409,Meme criticizing popular science communicators Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye. Shows split image with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson on left wearing dark suit with yellow tie, gesturing with hands while speaking, with blurred colorful bokeh background. Right side shows Bill Nye in brown/tan jacket holding microphone with serious expression. Top text in bold white letters: 'YOU MIGHT BE A SHEEPLE IF...' Bottom text states 'YOU BELIEVE A FAILED ACTOR AND FAILED COMEDIAN ARE SCIENTISTS.' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Attacks credibility of mainstream science popularizers by dismissing their scientific credentials and reducing them to entertainment backgrounds. References Bill Nye's background as comedian/TV personality and Neil deGrasse Tyson's media presence. Uses 'sheeple' (sheep + people) insult suggesting those who trust these figures are blindly following authority without critical thinking. Implies mainstream science education is entertainment propaganda rather than legitimate scientific discourse9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-133","title":"Other 133","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12339665_442607069272366_5021460751468119153_o.jpg","description":"Water level argument over dramatic ocean/beach sunset scene.

White page with black serif typography. Header reads '[Entered at Stationers' Hall.]' Main title in large capital letters: 'ZETETIC ASTRONOMY. EARTH NOT A GLOBE! AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE TRUE FIGURE OF THE EARTH: PROVING IT A PLANE, WITHOUT AXIAL OR ORBITAL MOTION; AND THE ONLY MATERIAL WORLD IN THE UNIVERSE!' Author listed as 'BY \"PARALLAX.\"' Published in London by 'SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, AND CO., STATIONERS' HALL COURT.' and 'Bath: S. HAYWARD, GREEN STREET.' Date: 1865. Bottom note: '[The Right of Translation is Reserved by the Author.]' with handwritten notation '1746.23'. Zetetic method emphasizes sensory observation over theoretical astronomy. 'Parallax' was pseudonym of Samuel Rowbotham, influential 19th century flat Earth proponent. Book laid foundation for modern flat Earth movement, arguing Earth is stationary plane based on direct observation and experiments rather than heliocentric model"}}]
