Shows dark stormy sky with layers of gray, blue, and purple clouds. Orange-golden sunlight breaks through clouds creating atmospheric lighting. Dark ocean water visible in lower portion with small waves. Horizon line appears flat where ocean meets cloudy sky. White text overlay in elegant font reads: 'Whenever experiments have been tried on the surface of standing water, this surface has always been found to be level. If the Earth were a globe, the surface of all standing water would be convex.' Bottom text in bold white capitals: 'THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROOF THAT EARTH IS NOT A GLOBE.' Argues that still water's observable flatness contradicts spherical Earth, since curved surface would require water to bulge/curve. Presents water's levelness as empirical evidence through direct observation and experimentation.
