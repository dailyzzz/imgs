3:T560,Grid collage of 8 different NASA Earth photographs from various years questioning inconsistencies in Earth's appearance. Black background. Top text in white: 'Come on NASA* make your mind up, what does the earth really look like?' Images arranged in two rows of 4. Top row: 1975 (pale blue marble with swirling white clouds, brown landmasses), 2015 (Blue Marble with bright blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents), 2007 (deep blue with white cloud swirls, green-brown land), 1997 (vivid blue with bright white clouds, green continents). Bottom row: 2007 (darker tones, brown Australia prominent), 2013 (pale appearance with white clouds, visible Africa/Europe), 2012 (bright blue with Americas visible), 2002 (deep blue with green landmasses). Right side label 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom text: '*ALL IMAGES ARE OFFICIAL NASA PICTURES OF EARTH, AS RELEASED THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS AND MAJOR NEWS AGENCIES OF THE WORLD. QUESTIONS: HOW BIG IS AMERICA? WHAT COLOUR ARE THE OCEANS, AND THE LAND? WHY IS THERE NEVER ANY REAL VIDEO OF THE EARTH SPINNING, ONLY STILLS? WHY ARE THE IMAGES SO VARIED? DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?' Points out dramatic variations in continent sizes, ocean colors (pale blue to deep blue), cloud coverage, and land tones across different NASA releases, questioning authenticity and consistency of space photography0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-140","title":"Other 140","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12400440_474572882742451_3281648999363055001_n.jpg","description":"Black and white NASA Earth photograph with parody text overlay.

Uses popular culture reference (hip-hop album cover format) to make accusation of photo manipulation accessible and memorable.

Character has unlit cigarette or toothpick in mouth, facial expression shows skeptical or questioning look with wide eyes staring at camera. Blurred green foliage background suggests jungle or forest setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN'T SEE THE CURVATURE BECAUSE THE EARTH IS TOO BIG?' Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN SEE SHIPS SAIL OVER THE HORIZON?' Bottom right watermark 'JM' logo. Meme points out perceived logical contradiction in mainstream explanation for why Earth's curvature isn't visible from ground level (too large to perceive) versus claim that ships disappearing over horizon proves curvature. Argues if Earth is too big to see curvature, horizon effects shouldn't be observable either. Uses Downey's skeptical expression to convey disbelief in contradictory reasoning"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
