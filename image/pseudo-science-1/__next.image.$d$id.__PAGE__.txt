Top panel with black starry background shows text 'IF THIS WAS TRUE' followed by diagram with blue orbital paths and yellow sun, text reads: 'EARTH IS ROTATING AT 1,000 MPH WHILE REVOLVING AROUND SUN AT 66,600 MPH AS THE SUN IS BLASTING THROUGH SPACE AT 450,000 MPH' with small moon and comet visible. Bottom panel shows labeled gyroscope diagram with components: Gyroscope frame, Spin axis, Inner gimbal, Outer gimbal, Rotor (yellow disc), with text 'ALL GYROSCOPES WOULD BE GOING APE SHIT'. Argues that if Earth were moving at these combined velocities in different directions, gyroscopes would register extreme unstable motion rather than maintaining stable orientation, questioning validity of heliocentric solar system motion claims based on gyroscope behavior which appears to indicate stationary Earth."},"prevImage":null,"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-2","title":"Pseudo Science 2","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/15271864_213817579065119_1162069432357549967_o.jpeg","description":"Minimalist text-based image with white background showing satirical reinterpretation of Einstein's famous equation. Large bold black text reads: 'E' (large letter E on left), 'verybody' (small subscript text), '=' (equals sign), 'm' (lowercase m), 'ind' (superscript text), 'C' (large capital C), 'ontrol' (small subscript text), with small superscript '2' in upper right corner. Reads as 'Everybody = mind Control squared' or 'E=mc²' reinterpreted as mass mind control equation. Satirical commentary suggesting Einstein's physics is propaganda tool for controlling masses through pseudo-scientific authority, or that scientific establishment uses complex equations to manipulate public perception and maintain control through intimidating mathematics that most cannot verify independently."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
