Sailboat, lifeguard stand, beach umbrellas, swimmers, sunbathers visible throughout extremely detailed illustration in classic Waldo art style. Top text reads 'FUCK WALDO' (profane dismissal of original search objective). Bottom text asks 'WHERE'S THE CURVATURE?' Clever subversion of 'Where's Waldo' concept, challenging viewers to find Earth's curvature in horizon line instead of hidden character. Horizon appears perfectly flat across ocean scene"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-31","title":"Funny 31","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/5c77bfcd52af6ee48748df3406e196b2-meme-maker-collection.jpeg","description":"Zoolander movie meme featuring two characters from the film in distinctive fashion-forward outfits. Character on right wears elaborate zebra-striped fur coat with dramatic styling. Both characters have signature 'Blue Steel' modeling expressions. Top text reads 'THAT FLAT EARTH' and bottom text completes phrase 'SO HOT RIGHT NOW' in white capital letters. Parodies the famous 'so hot right now' quote from Zoolander about fleeting fashion trends, applying it to flat Earth movement's growing popularity online.

Top text reads 'I JUST SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY ON CHRISTMAS PRESENTS'. Bottom text completes thought: 'BY TALKING ABOUT FLAT EARTH WITH MY RELATIVES'. Humorous take on social consequences of discussing flat Earth theory at family gatherings, suggesting controversial topic acts as natural family distance-creator, reducing gift exchange obligations.
