13:T1f19,Sarcastic meme labeling cell phone tower as "REAL GPS SATELLITES" claiming GPS works via ground towers not orbiting satellites. Image presents flat Earth argument that Global Positioning System operates through terrestrial infrastructure rather than space-based satellites, implying satellites don't exist or space travel is fake. Photograph shows typical cellular communications tower against clear blue sky. Tower is tall metal lattice structure rising from ground (likely 50-100+ feet tall). Main vertical pole is gray/silver metal with triangular lattice framework providing structural support. Multiple horizontal platforms/arms extend from upper portion at different heights supporting antenna equipment. ANTENNA ARRAYS: Upper section shows multiple white rectangular panel antennas - sector antennas typical of cellular base stations. Antennas arranged pointing outward in different directions to provide 360-degree coverage area. Each rectangular panel is directional antenna serving specific sector of coverage circle. Multiple panels at different heights may serve different frequencies/technologies (2G, 3G, 4G LTE, 5G). EQUIPMENT: Various gray/white equipment boxes visible mounted on tower - likely contain radio transceivers, amplifiers, power equipment. Cables run down tower connecting antennas to equipment and ground-level facilities. Metal framework includes climbing pegs/ladder for technician access during maintenance. Tower design is standard telecommunications infrastructure visible in urban/suburban areas worldwide. SKY BACKGROUND: Clear blue sky with few wispy white clouds. Bright daylight illumination suggesting midday. Sky color gradients naturally from deeper blue at top to lighter near horizon. Pleasant weather conditions making tower clearly visible without obstruction. TEXT OVERLAYS: Upper left in white text: "fb.com/fematters" attribution identifying flat Earth community source. Bottom of image in large bold white letters with black outline: "REAL GPS SATELLITES" - sarcastic caption implying these cell towers are what actually provide GPS signals, not satellites orbiting in space. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SATELLITES: Flat Earth model often claims satellites don't exist - space is fake, rockets can't reach "space" (which doesn't exist as described), everything attributed to satellites is actually done by ground-based infrastructure, high-altitude balloons, or other terrestrial technology. 2) GPS IS GROUND-BASED: Flat Earthers claim GPS works through network of ground towers (like cell towers), not 24+ orbiting satellites. Argument suggests: Government claims satellites but actually uses towers; we're told signals come from space but they come from terrestrial network; whole satellite narrative is cover story for flat Earth. 3) "THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING": If satellites are fake, then satellite photos of spherical Earth are fake, satellite communications are lie, space exploration is hoax, etc. Discrediting satellite technology supports broader flat Earth narrative that all space-related evidence for spherical Earth is fabricated. TECHNICAL REALITY - Why This Is Wrong: 1) CELL TOWERS ≠ GPS: Cell towers provide CELLULAR communications (phone calls, text messages, mobile data). GPS is SEPARATE system using dedicated satellites (not cell towers). These are different technologies serving different purposes. Cell phones CAN use cell tower triangulation for approximate location (cellular location services), but this is less accurate than GPS and different technology. 2) GPS SATELLITE SYSTEM: GPS (Global Positioning System) uses constellation of 24-32 satellites orbiting at approximately 20,200 km (12,550 miles) altitude. Each satellite broadcasts precise time signal and orbital position. GPS receivers calculate position by measuring time delays from multiple satellites (minimum 4) and solving geometric equations. This requires satellites at high altitude to provide wide coverage - ground towers couldn't provide GPS coverage over oceans, deserts, polar regions, mountains. 3) GPS ACCURACY: GPS provides meter-level accuracy globally, including over oceans thousands of miles from any land (and thus any cell towers). Ships, aircraft, hikers in wilderness, military operations in remote areas all use GPS where no cell towers exist. If GPS required ground towers, it wouldn't work in these locations - but it does. 4) OBSERVABLE SATELLITES: GPS satellites (and other satellites) can be: Tracked by amateur astronomers using telescopes; observed as moving points of light at dawn/dusk when sun illuminates them against dark sky; tracked by amateur radio operators who receive and decode their signals; located using apps showing real-time satellite positions (easily verified by looking at sky when app indicates satellite overhead). 5) INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS: Multiple countries operate independent satellite navigation systems: US GPS, Russian GLONASS, European Galileo, Chinese BeiDou, Indian NavIC, Japanese QZSS. Each country launched its own satellites, operates its own ground control, provides its own signals. Would require impossible international conspiracy for all these competing nations to fake satellite systems while actually using ground towers. 6) ORBITAL MECHANICS: Satellite positions predicted by Newtonian/Keplerian orbital mechanics - same physics explaining Moon orbit, planetary motion. Predictions verified by tracking satellites over decades. If satellites didn't exist or weren't where predicted, these calculations would fail - but they work precisely, confirming satellite locations. 7) LAUNCH VISIBILITY: Satellite launches visible to public - SpaceX launches from Florida/California watched by thousands of spectators who see rocket ascending, stage separation, satellites deploying. International Space Station visible to naked eye orbiting overhead. Claiming satellites don't exist requires dismissing direct observations by millions of people. CELL TOWER CAPABILITIES: Cell towers have limited range (few miles per tower), require line-of-sight, form networks that hand off signals as users move between coverage areas. Network designed for relatively small geographic areas with dense tower deployment in populated regions. Utterly incapable of providing global positioning across oceans, wilderness, or areas without tower infrastructure. Comparing cell tower to GPS satellite is fundamental misunderstanding of both technologies. IRONY: Image creator probably uses GPS daily (smartphone maps, navigation apps, vehicle GPS) without considering how signal reaches them over oceans during overseas flights, in national parks miles from cell service, or in rural areas with no towers visible. GPS working in these tower-free locations directly contradicts meme's claim. VISUAL RHETORIC: Meme works by: 1) Showing familiar infrastructure (cell tower) that audience has seen. 2) Labeling it with unfamiliar term ("satellites") creating dissonance. 3) Implying switch/revelation - what you thought were satellites are actually just towers. 4) Supporting broader flat Earth narrative that authorities lie about technology. Format is simple, shareable, requires no detailed argument. Works as thought-terminating image - instead of researching GPS technology, viewer remembers "satellites are really just towers" and dismisses satellite evidence. Effectiveness depends on audience's technical ignorance - anyone who understands GPS technology immediately recognizes image as nonsensical. But for those unfamiliar with how GPS works, meme plants seed of doubt about satellite reality. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) confirms this is propaganda supporting flat Earth narrative by attacking credibility of satellite technology and, by extension, any satellite-based evidence for spherical Earth. Meme conflates different technologies, ignores physics of GPS operation, and relies on audience not investigating actual GPS satellite system.14:T20e1,Historical 1912 flat Earth book "The Enlightenment of the World" by John G. Abizaid showing cover and Chapter 1 about water proving flat Earth. Two-panel photograph of antique publication demonstrating flat Earth beliefs existed in modern era, used by contemporary movement to show historical precedent for their beliefs. Image presents early 20th century flat Earth literature as evidence that questioning globe Earth has legitimate intellectual tradition. LEFT PANEL - BOOK COVER: Shows front cover of bound book in aged condition. Paper appears yellowed/cream colored typical of century-old publication. Cover shows signs of age - slight foxing (brown spots), wear at edges, fading. Design is typical early 1900s American publishing style - decorative but restrained. AMERICAN FLAG ILLUSTRATION: Upper portion of cover features waving American flag in full color (or appears to be - reds, blues visible). Flag shown on pole with decorative finial. Stars and stripes clearly depicted. Flag association with flat Earth book suggests author framing flat Earth belief as American/patriotic cause. TITLE TEXT: Below flag, "SECOND EDITION" in small capitals indicates book was successful enough to warrant reprinting. Main title "THE ENLIGHTENMENT of THE WORLD" in large serif font with decorative styling. Word "of" in smaller italic script connecting two title elements. "THE WORLD" positioned below with decorative underline/rule. AUTHOR: "By JOHN G. ABIZAID" in uppercase letters below title. John G. Abizaid was early 20th century flat Earth advocate, one of several authors publishing flat Earth arguments during this period. SUBTITLE/DESCRIPTION: Below author name, text reads: "This book contains proof that the earth is flat and stationary, while the sun, moon and stars are in constant motion." This summarizes flat Earth geocentric model - stationary flat Earth with celestial bodies moving above/around it. Continues: "Also letters showing the testimony of Scripture on the subject." Indicates religious/biblical arguments included, common in flat Earth literature combining pseudo-science with scriptural interpretation. DATE: "1912" at bottom establishing publication year - over 110 years ago, well into era when spherical Earth was established scientific fact (known since ancient Greece, confirmed by global navigation, photography, etc.). RIGHT PANEL - INTERIOR PAGE: Shows page 7 of book, beginning of Chapter 1. Page appears cream/off-white with clear black printed text in serif typeface typical of era. CHAPTER HEADING: "CHAPTER I." centered at top in capitals. Below, "THE WATER." as chapter title - first "proof" presented in book. TEXT CONTENT (full transcription): "You know that there is more water on the earth than dry land. Here is the first proof: The water proves that the earth is flat, level and stationary. Water is liquid. It runs always down and seeks its level, and never runs up unless by power. And the water of the ocean is every way pretty near joined together on the earth, and they call it liquid. It will not stay on a round earth. Take a glass of water and pour it on a round ball and if the water stays on, then the earth must be round, but if the water falls off then the earth must be flat. This is the proof: Take a pan and fill it with water and see if it is higher in the center than on the sides. If this is true, then the water of the ocean might be round, but if the water in the pan is flat and level, then the water of the ocean must also be flat and level. The water of the ocean is level and can be nothing else, because it is liquid, which proves that the land is flat and not round. The land is not exactly flat and level, for there are mountains and valleys. But it makes no difference, for if the mountains were in the valleys it would leave the land flat and level and higher than the water. I have been thinking of the question for a long time. At last I have found out for myself from the water and the sunbeams, the sun's rising, the sunlight, etc., that the earth cannot be round and in motion, as books and teachers have taught. The teachers offer proofs to show that the earth is round, but the proofs they offer amount to nothing. When the children go to school, the teacher tells them the world is round, and, of course, they believe it, and they do not ask how it is round. They are young and they know very little. When they grow up they still believe the earth is round and in motion, and so in turn they teach this to others. The water is flat, which proves that the earth is flat and stationary. From its fruit you will know what kind of a tree it is." WATER ARGUMENT ANALYSIS: Abizaid's argument represents classic flat Earth reasoning still used today: 1) "Water seeks its level" - True for small scales where gravity pulls water to lowest point in container. 2) "Water won't stay on round ball" - Misunderstands gravity. Gravity pulls toward center of mass, not "down" in absolute direction. On sphere, gravity pulls water toward center, holding it on surface regardless of position. 3) "Pan test" - Compares small container (where surface tension and small scale make water appear flat) to ocean (where Earth's gravity holds water to spherical surface). Scale difference makes comparison invalid. 4) "Ocean is level" - "Level" in physics means perpendicular to gravity vector, not geometrically flat. Ocean IS level - perpendicular to gravity at every point - but this means following Earth's curved surface, not being flat plane. SCIENTIFIC REBUTTAL: 1) GRAVITY: Water stays on spherical Earth because gravity pulls toward Earth's center. "Down" is always toward center, not absolute direction. Water on ball falls off because ball's mass is too small for significant gravity - not because round things can't hold water. Earth's gravity holds oceans firmly to surface regardless of location. 2) SCALE: At ocean scale, water DOES follow Earth's curvature - that's why ships disappear hull-first over horizon, why lighthouses have limited range, why sea-level varies with latitude (bulge at equator from rotation). Curvature too gradual to see in pan of water, but measurable over distances. 3) "LEVEL" DEFINITION: Surveyors and engineers understand "level" means perpendicular to gravity, not geometrically flat. Large construction projects (bridges, tunnels, railways) must account for Earth's curvature - proves spherical Earth assumed and verified in civil engineering. 4) OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE: Ships disappearing bottom-first, time zones existing, different stars visible at different latitudes, circular Earth shadow on moon during lunar eclipses, photos from space - all confirm spherical Earth, contradict flat Earth water argument. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: 1912 was not period of scientific ignorance - spherical Earth known for over 2,000 years, confirmed by centuries of global navigation, established in all scientific education. Flat Earth belief in 1912 was fringe position held by small group contradicting overwhelming scientific consensus. Abizaid's book represents pseudo-scientific contrarianism, not legitimate scientific debate. RELIGIOUS COMPONENT: Reference to "testimony of Scripture" indicates flat Earth arguments often combined with biblical literalism - interpreting verses about "four corners of earth," "circle of earth," "firmament" as proof of flat cosmology. This tradition continues in modern flat Earth movement where religious belief often accompanies pseudo-scientific arguments. PURPOSE OF IMAGE: Showing 1912 flat Earth book serves modern flat Earth community by: 1) Demonstrating historical precedent - "people have questioned globe Earth for centuries" 2) Providing "intellectual" source material - book format suggests scholarly work 3) Connecting to American patriotism (flag imagery) 4) Linking to religious tradition (Scripture reference) 5) Showing arguments haven't changed - same "water is level" reasoning used today However, historical existence of flat Earth books proves only that some people held incorrect beliefs - not that beliefs were correct. Phrenology, alchemy, miasma theory also had books and adherents; existence doesn't validate. Attribution "fb.com/fematters" indicates modern flat Earth community sharing historical material to support contemporary conspiracy theory. Book is genuine historical artifact; interpretation placing it in legitimate scientific tradition is misleading.15:T1f31,Burning globe Earth image with text claiming exposing "globe Earth lie" causes modern science, gravity, Big Bang, and evolution to "fall apart." Dramatic apocalyptic imagery showing Earth as flaming sphere being destroyed, representing flat Earth belief that spherical Earth is foundational lie upon which all modern science is built. Image suggests rejecting globe Earth leads to spiritual awakening and self-discovery. VISUAL COMPOSITION: Background shows serene natural landscape - calm water (lake or sea) reflecting sky, mountains or hills in distance, golden/amber atmospheric lighting suggesting sunrise or sunset. Peaceful natural scene contrasts dramatically with central destruction imagery. CENTRAL IMAGE: Globe Earth depicted as sphere engulfed in flames and fire. Planet appears to be burning, disintegrating, or exploding. Fire effects show orange, yellow, red flames consuming the sphere. Globe shows recognizable continental shapes (Africa visible) being destroyed by flames. Artistic rendering combining photograph of landscape with digitally composited burning globe. Symbolism clear: the "lie" of globe Earth being destroyed/exposed, burning away deception to reveal truth. Water reflection shows burning globe mirrored below, creating symmetrical composition. TEXT CONTENT - Multiple layers of text overlaid on image: TOP TEXT (yellow, large font): "WHEN WE EXPOSE THE GLOBE EARTH LIE" - Opening statement framing spherical Earth as deliberate deception to be revealed/exposed. MIDDLE TEXT (yellow, smaller font, sequential statements): "MODERN SCIENCE FALLS APART" - Claim that globe Earth is foundation of modern science, removing it collapses everything. "WHICH CAUSES THE THEORY OF GRAVITY TO FALL APART" - Gravity specifically targeted as dependent on globe Earth model. "WHICH CAUSES THE BIG BANG THEORY TO FALL APART" - Cosmological origins theory linked to globe Earth. "WHICH CAUSES EVOLUTION TO FALL APART" - Evolutionary biology connected to globe model. "AND WHEN WE FINALLY REALIZE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT EVERYTHING" - Culminating claim of total systematic deception. BOTTOM TEXT (yellow, large font): "WE CAN THEN BEGIN TO DISCOVER WHO WE TRULY ARE AND WHY WE ARE HERE" - Spiritual/existential conclusion suggesting flat Earth truth leads to self-discovery and purpose. ATTRIBUTION: "Nick Havok" credited in bottom right corner - likely image creator. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT STRUCTURE: Image presents domino theory of scientific deception: 1) Globe Earth is the foundational lie. 2) Gravity was invented to explain how things stay on spinning ball (flat Earth claims gravity is fake, density/buoyancy explains falling objects). 3) Big Bang requires universe of spherical planets/stars (flat Earth model has different cosmology - dome/firmament over flat plane). 4) Evolution requires billions of years and cosmic scale that globe Earth/Big Bang provides (flat Earth often tied to young Earth creationism). 5) All modern science built on these interconnected "lies." 6) Exposing globe Earth topples entire edifice of scientific knowledge. 7) Once "truth" revealed, spiritual awakening follows - discovering true nature of reality, humanity's purpose, perhaps religious truth previously hidden by scientific materialism. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE: Globe Earth, gravity, Big Bang, evolution are separate theories with independent evidence. Disproving one wouldn't automatically disprove others. Each supported by different types of evidence from different fields. 2) GRAVITY: Gravity is directly observable (objects fall, tides occur, planets orbit). Mathematical predictions of gravitational theory verified to extreme precision. GPS satellites, space missions, planetary probes all operate using gravitational calculations that work perfectly. Gravity doesn't require belief in globe Earth - it's independently measurable. 3) BIG BANG: Supported by cosmic microwave background radiation, observed expansion of universe, abundance of light elements, galaxy formation observations. Evidence doesn't depend on Earth's shape - comes from telescopes and instruments measuring distant cosmos. 4) EVOLUTION: Supported by fossil record, genetic evidence, observed speciation, biogeography, comparative anatomy. Evidence comes from biology, genetics, paleontology - fields unrelated to Earth's shape. Evolution would be true whether Earth is sphere, flat, or cube. 5) GLOBE EARTH: Supported by circumnavigation, satellite imagery, physics of gravity, astronomical observations, ship disappearance over horizon, time zones, different star visibility at different latitudes, lunar eclipse shadow, and countless other independent observations. Not arbitrary choice but conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. CONSPIRACY THEORY STRUCTURE: Image exemplifies "grand unified conspiracy" thinking where multiple separate "lies" are connected into single massive deception: If globe Earth is lie, then NASA lies, then space exploration is fake, then satellites are fake, then physics is wrong, then Big Bang is fiction, then evolution is fiction, then all scientists are either deceived or complicit, then entire educational system spreads lies, then media reinforces lies, then governments worldwide cooperate in deception. This creates unfalsifiable worldview where any contradicting evidence is simply "part of the lie." Scale of conspiracy required is impossibly large - millions of scientists, educators, pilots, sailors, engineers would need to be deceived or actively lying. RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL DIMENSION: Final line about discovering "who we truly are and why we are here" reveals spiritual motivation underlying many flat Earth beliefs. Movement often connected to: Biblical literalism (interpreting verses about firmament, pillars of Earth, four corners literally). Rejection of scientific materialism as spiritually empty worldview. Belief that globe Earth/evolution/Big Bang specifically designed to undermine religious faith. Sense that scientific establishment is Satanic or anti-God conspiracy. Desire for humanity to have special cosmic significance (flat Earth with dome often places humanity at center of creation, unlike heliocentric model where Earth is one planet among billions). PSYCHOLOGICAL APPEAL: Image appeals to: Distrust of authority/institutions. Desire for hidden knowledge. Sense of being special/awakened while masses are deceived. Spiritual seeking and desire for meaning. Rejection of complexity in favor of simple explanations. Community belonging in alternative truth movement. Feeling empowered by "seeing through lies" that fooled everyone else. VISUAL RHETORIC: Burning globe is powerful symbolic image: Destruction of false beliefs (cathartic). Fire as purification (burning away deception). Dramatic apocalyptic imagery appealing to those expecting end times or great awakening. Juxtaposition with peaceful nature background suggests truth brings serenity while lies create chaos. Reflection in water creates dreamlike quality suggesting transition between states of consciousness. Golden lighting evokes spiritual/mystical atmosphere. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works as propaganda by: Presenting complex scientific topics as single interconnected conspiracy rather than separate fields. Using emotional imagery (burning, destruction) rather than logical argument. Promising spiritual reward (self-discovery, purpose) for accepting flat Earth truth. Creating us-vs-them dynamic (awakened few vs deceived masses). Providing simple explanation for complex world (it's all lies). Not requiring viewer to understand any actual science - just reject it wholesale. CRITIQUE: Image makes claims without evidence, assumes connections between unrelated fields, requires impossibly large conspiracy, contradicts directly observable reality, appeals to emotion rather than reason, and promises unfalsifiable spiritual rewards for belief. Represents conspiracy thinking pattern rather than scientific inquiry.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-380","title":"Other 380","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12901389_486065631593176_2750884562270147089_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-379","title":"Other 379","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12901358_480512702148469_5865896417149727654_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-381","title":"Other 381","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12916949_483617311838008_9044399751281064854_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

Argument suggests: Government claims satellites but actually uses towers; we're told signals come from space but they come from terrestrial network; whole satellite narrative is cover story for flat Earth. 3) "THEY LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING": If satellites are fake, then satellite photos of spherical Earth are fake, satellite communications are lie, space exploration is hoax, etc. Discrediting satellite technology supports broader flat Earth narrative that all space-related evidence for spherical Earth is fabricated. TECHNICAL REALITY - Why This Is Wrong: 1) CELL TOWERS ≠ GPS: Cell towers provide CELLULAR communications (phone calls, text messages, mobile data). GPS is SEPARATE system using dedicated satellites (not cell towers). These are different technologies serving different purposes. Cell phones CAN use cell tower triangulation for approximate location (cellular location services), but this is less accurate than GPS and different technology. 2) GPS SATELLITE SYSTEM: GPS (Global Positioning System) uses constellation of 24-32 satellites orbiting at approximately 20,200 km (12,550 miles) altitude. Each satellite broadcasts precise time signal and orbital position. GPS receivers calculate position by measuring time delays from multiple satellites (minimum 4) and solving geometric equations. This requires satellites at high altitude to provide wide coverage - ground towers couldn't provide GPS coverage over oceans, deserts, polar regions, mountains. 3) GPS ACCURACY: GPS provides meter-level accuracy globally, including over oceans thousands of miles from any land (and thus any cell towers). Ships, aircraft, hikers in wilderness, military operations in remote areas all use GPS where no cell towers exist. If GPS required ground towers, it wouldn't work in these locations - but it does. 4) OBSERVABLE SATELLITES: GPS satellites (and other satellites) can be: Tracked by amateur astronomers using telescopes; observed as moving points of light at dawn/dusk when sun illuminates them against dark sky; tracked by amateur radio operators who receive and decode their signals; located using apps showing real-time satellite positions (easily verified by looking at sky when app indicates satellite overhead). 5) INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS: Multiple countries operate independent satellite navigation systems: US GPS, Russian GLONASS, European Galileo, Chinese BeiDou, Indian NavIC, Japanese QZSS. Each country launched its own satellites, operates its own ground control, provides its own signals. Would require impossible international conspiracy for all these competing nations to fake satellite systems while actually using ground towers. 6) ORBITAL MECHANICS: Satellite positions predicted by Newtonian/Keplerian orbital mechanics - same physics explaining Moon orbit, planetary motion. Predictions verified by tracking satellites over decades. If satellites didn't exist or weren't where predicted, these calculations would fail - but they work precisely, confirming satellite locations. 7) LAUNCH VISIBILITY: Satellite launches visible to public - SpaceX launches from Florida/California watched by thousands of spectators who see rocket ascending, stage separation, satellites deploying. International Space Station visible to naked eye orbiting overhead. Claiming satellites don't exist requires dismissing direct observations by millions of people. CELL TOWER CAPABILITIES: Cell towers have limited range (few miles per tower), require line-of-sight, form networks that hand off signals as users move between coverage areas. Network designed for relatively small geographic areas with dense tower deployment in populated regions. Utterly incapable of providing global positioning across oceans, wilderness, or areas without tower infrastructure. Comparing cell tower to GPS satellite is fundamental misunderstanding of both technologies. IRONY: Image creator probably uses GPS daily (smartphone maps, navigation apps, vehicle GPS) without considering how signal reaches them over oceans during overseas flights, in national parks miles from cell service, or in rural areas with no towers visible. GPS working in these tower-free locations directly contradicts meme's claim. VISUAL RHETORIC: Meme works by: 1) Showing familiar infrastructure (cell tower) that audience has seen. 2) Labeling it with unfamiliar term ("satellites") creating dissonance. 3) Implying switch/revelation - what you thought were satellites are actually just towers. 4) Supporting broader flat Earth narrative that authorities lie about technology. Format is simple, shareable, requires no detailed argument. Works as thought-terminating image - instead of researching GPS technology, viewer remembers "satellites are really just towers" and dismisses satellite evidence. Effectiveness depends on audience's technical ignorance - anyone who understands GPS technology immediately recognizes image as nonsensical. But for those unfamiliar with how GPS works, meme plants seed of doubt about satellite reality. Attribution to flat Earth community (fb.com/fematters) confirms this is propaganda supporting flat Earth narrative by attacking credibility of satellite technology and, by extension, any satellite-based evidence for spherical Earth. Meme conflates different technologies, ignores physics of GPS operation, and relies on audience not investigating actual GPS satellite system.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 380 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Sarcastic meme labeling cell phone tower as \"REAL GPS SATELLITES\" claiming GPS works via ground towers not orbiting satellites.
