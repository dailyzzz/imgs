Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'Briefly, everything occurs as if the Earth were at rest...' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, HENRICK LORENTZ •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote from Hendrik Lorentz (Dutch physicist who developed Lorentz transformations used in special relativity) discussing how physical observations from Earth's reference frame appear consistent with stationary Earth. Quote taken out of context - Lorentz was discussing reference frame equivalence and transformation equations that allow calculations from Earth's perspective while accepting Earth's actual motion. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's statement about mathematical reference frames as admission of geocentrism, though Lorentz accepted heliocentric model and his work underlies modern relativity theory."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 12"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of elderly physicist with white beard and mustache wearing dark suit, sitting at desk with book or papers..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396806_247796025708544_5954844160917119702_n.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
