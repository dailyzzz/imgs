Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'The data [of Michelson-Morley] were almost unbelievable... There was only one other possible conclusion to draw — that the Earth was at rest.' Attribution: '• PHYSICIST, BERNARD JAFFE •' followed by hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. References famous 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempting to detect Earth's motion through luminiferous aether, which yielded null result. Quote suggests experiment proved stationary Earth, though actual scientific interpretation led to special relativity theory and abandonment of aether concept, not geocentrism. Selective quote mining presenting null result as evidence for stationary Earth rather than indicating aether doesn't exist and light speed is constant regardless of reference frame motion.4:T417,Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of man in glasses, white collar shirt with polka dot tie, formal suit. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'There was just one alternative; the earth's true velocity through space might happen to have been nil.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, ARTHUR EDDINGTON •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. Quote from Arthur Eddington (British astrophysicist famous for 1919 solar eclipse expedition confirming Einstein's general relativity) discussing theoretical possibility that Earth could have zero velocity through space, taken out of context to suggest stationary Earth. Historical context: quote likely from discussing Michelson-Morley experiment results and philosophical interpretation of reference frames, not actual endorsement of geocentrism. Eddington was prominent advocate of relativity theory. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's acknowledgment of null hypothesis as support for stationary Earth model.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-12","title":"Pseudo Science 12","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396806_247796025708544_5954844160917119702_n.jpeg","description":"Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of elderly physicist with white beard and mustache wearing dark suit, sitting at desk with book or papers.

Quote from Hendrik Lorentz (Dutch physicist who developed Lorentz transformations used in special relativity) discussing how physical observations from Earth's reference frame appear consistent with stationary Earth. Quote taken out of context - Lorentz was discussing reference frame equivalence and transformation equations that allow calculations from Earth's perspective while accepting Earth's actual motion. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's statement about mathematical reference frames as admission of geocentrism, though Lorentz accepted heliocentric model and his work underlies modern relativity theory."},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-11","title":"Pseudo Science 11","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396756_247796012375212_5306635309299996008_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-13","title":"Pseudo Science 13","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396884_247796042375209_2210450211636051693_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
