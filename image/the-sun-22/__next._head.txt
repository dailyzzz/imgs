Bright golden-yellow sun rays (crepuscular rays) burst dramatically through gaps in dark gray cloud layers, creating spectacular light beams radiating downward and across scene. Multiple layers of clouds at different altitudes show varying illumination: some backlit with golden edges, others appearing dark gray in silhouette. Upper atmosphere shows mixture of gold and dark tones with clouds breaking apart. Lower portion shows golden rays reflecting off ocean surface creating shimmering path. Sky displays dramatic color gradient from bright golden-yellow where sun breaks through to darker gray-brown in shadowed areas. Classic example of crepuscular rays - parallel sunlight appearing to diverge due to perspective, creating spectacular atmospheric light show often used in discussions about sun's distance and light ray geometry"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The Sun 22"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Dramatic sunset photograph over ocean with sun partially obscured by thick layered storm clouds creating divine rays.
