Left side shows bright orange fireplace flames with '@FREDENKLW' watermark visible. Questions how scientists determined sun's mass (approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kg) from Earth. Implies measurement is impossible or fabricated due to distance. Actually, solar mass is calculated through gravitational effects on planets using Kepler's laws and Newton's law of universal gravitation, not direct weighing. Earth's orbital period and distance allow precise calculation without physical contact.

Bright yellow-orange sun sits just above horizon partially obscured by dark gray cloud bank, with multiple distinct light beams radiating upward through clear blue sky above clouds in fan pattern. Golden sunset light illuminates lower clouds and ocean surface. Beach with sandy shore and small waves visible in foreground. Sky shows beautiful gradient from deep blue at top through lighter blue to golden orange near horizon. Milky Way galaxy faintly visible in upper center of darkening sky. Classic example of anticrepuscular and crepuscular rays where parallel sunlight creates appearance of diverging beams due to perspective, demonstrating same optical principle as converging railroad tracks. Stunning natural display of atmospheric optics during twilight"}}]
