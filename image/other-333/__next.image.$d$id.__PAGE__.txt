3:Tde6,Elaborate flat Earth cosmology digital artwork composite depicting dome model with space as fabrication. Complex fantasy illustration showing flat Earth believers' cosmological worldview. Center features circular flat Earth disc showing recognizable continental landmasses - North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia arranged on flat plane surrounded by concentric circles creating target-like pattern. Blue water covers flat disc surface with green/yellow continents. Disc appears to be physical platform or stage set. Outer rim shows white/ice barrier (Antarctic ice wall) containing oceans. Surrounding flat Earth disc are crowds of small human figures arranged in circular formation around edge, suggesting audience or observers watching staged performance. Space shuttle visible in upper left flying through purple/blue nebula clouds bears text "NASSHOLES" on fuselage - explicit mockery of NASA space agency, suggesting space program is hoax or deception. Cosmic background shows vibrant purple, blue, pink, and cyan nebula clouds with stars scattered throughout, creating dreamy fantasy atmosphere rather than realistic space. Two figures (possibly astronauts or travelers) stand on elevated platform or hill in upper center, silhouetted against colorful sky, appearing to oversee flat Earth model below. Right foreground shows close-up of astronaut in white EVA spacesuit with large reflective helmet visor, American flag visible on shoulder, NASA logo patch on chest. Helmet visor shows golden/brown reflection. Spacesuit highly detailed with white fabric layers, mechanical joints, life support equipment. Astronaut positioned as if floating or standing at edge of flat Earth platform, perspective suggests they're part of elaborate stage show or set piece rather than actual space explorer. Lower left shows "DDees.com" attribution - likely David Dees, artist known for conspiracy theory illustrations. Artwork embodies multiple flat Earth concepts: 1) Earth as flat circular disc rather than sphere, 2) Space as theatrical fabrication rather than reality, 3) NASA as deceptive organization creating illusion of space travel, 4) Firmament or dome concept suggested by enclosed theatrical setting, 5) Antarctica as ice wall containing world's oceans at edge. Image designed to visually represent conspiracy theory that space agencies fake space exploration using studio sets, green screens, and CGI, with astronauts as actors rather than explorers. Artistic style is surreal fantasy composite blending photographic elements with digital painting. Vibrant nebula background serves dual purpose: creating visually striking image while suggesting "outer space" depicted in NASA imagery is artificial creation rather than photographed reality. Crowds surrounding edge could represent general population as spectators to grand deception, unaware they're watching staged performance rather than genuine scientific achievement. This type of imagery popular in flat Earth communities as artistic expression of belief system, though it represents misunderstanding of extensive evidence for spherical Earth: satellite imagery, GPS systems, international flights, amateur high-altitude balloon footage, ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different star constellations visible from different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect, photographs from ISS, testimony from astronauts of multiple nations including Cold War adversaries. Image is digital art/propaganda rather than documentation of reality.4:Tde1,Composite meme image arguing water reflections prove flat Earth, divided into two sections. Top section shows dramatic nighttime urban street photography of wet pavement reflecting city lights - vibrant streaks of red, orange, yellow, blue, and pink light from traffic signals, car headlights/taillights, and street lighting create vivid mirror-like reflections on rain-soaked asphalt. Pedestrians with umbrellas and vehicles visible in motion-blurred cityscape scene. Text overlays: "REFLECTIONS ON A FLAT SURFACE" at top and "IT CAN'T HAPPEN ON A CURVE" in middle. Bottom section contains three side-by-side photographs of sunset/sunrise over ocean showing sun's reflection on water creating vertical columnar light path. Left image: sunset with orange sun low on horizon creating straight vertical reflection column on calm water. Center image: brighter daytime sun over ocean with prominent vertical reflection pillar extending down to shoreline waves. Right image: orange sunset with sun's reflection creating long vertical light streak on water surface. All three ocean images demonstrate same phenomenon - sun reflecting off water creates elongated vertical line of light stretching from sun to observer, classic specular reflection on rippled water surface. Photographer credit: "Nick Havok" on top image, "fb.com/fematters" attribution on left image. Argument claims that mirror-like reflections on water prove water surface must be flat, and that such reflections would be impossible on curved surface. This reasoning employs localized observation error - while Earth is spherical, any small section of surface appears flat at human scale due to planet's enormous size (7,917 mile diameter). Logic flaw: Meme conflates "locally flat" with "globally flat." Scientific explanation of reflections: Water surface creating reflections need only be locally smooth to act as mirror - curvature at planetary scale (8 inches per mile squared) is completely irrelevant to reflection physics at scales of city streets or ocean horizons visible to observer. Wet pavement in urban photo is obviously locally flat (manufactured road surface), but this says nothing about Earth's overall shape - by same logic, flat tabletop would "prove" Earth is flat. Ocean reflection images show specular reflection on rippled surface: columnar shape results from fact that waves present constantly changing angles of microscopic "mirrors" (water surface facets), and only those wavelets oriented at correct angle to reflect sun toward observer contribute to visible reflection, creating characteristic vertical pillar. This effect occurs because observer-sun-water geometry means reflective facets must lie along straight line between observer and sun, creating column appearance regardless of Earth's curvature. On perfectly spherical Earth with calm water, sun's reflection would still appear as column because only surface points along observer-sun axis can reflect light to observer's eyes. Horizon distance from sea level observer is approximately 3 miles - within this distance, Earth's curvature drops only 6 feet, far too subtle to affect visible reflection patterns. Curvature becomes irrelevant at scale of wave heights (inches to feet) that determine reflection characteristics. Additionally, photographs use long exposure/compression that enhances reflection column appearance. Conclusion: Reflections demonstrate only that local water surface sections are smooth enough to reflect light (whether flat or curved), not that entire Earth surface is flat plane.5:Tea5,ISS hoax meme claiming International Space Station footage filmed using green screen technology. Image shows astronaut in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuit against gradient background transitioning from white/light blue at top to darker blue-green at bottom. Astronaut positioned in three-quarter profile view showing right side of suit and helmet. White spacesuit highly detailed with realistic textures - fabric layers, mechanical joints, equipment pouches, hoses, connectors, straps visible across torso and arms. Large spherical helmet with clear polycarbonate visor shows astronaut's face - appears to be middle-aged person with serious expression looking off to side. Interior helmet lighting visible illuminating face. Gold-tinted sun visor in raised position above clear visor. Helmet attached to Hard Upper Torso (HUT) unit with metal neck ring connector. Right shoulder displays prominent American flag patch - rectangular flag with red, white, and blue stripes and stars. Chest area shows various equipment including caution/warning labels, attachment points for safety tethers. Left side shows NASA logo patch - classic blue circular "meatball" design with red chevron, white text, and orbital trajectory. Suit appears to be EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) used for spacewalks. Background intentionally simple gradient suggesting studio environment rather than space. Text overlay in large bold blue letters at top left: "NASA ISS HOAX AstroNOT" (deliberately misspelling astronaut as "astroNOT" to mock authenticity). Bottom text in blue: "#YearBehindGreenScreen" hashtag suggesting ongoing deception. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Lower right shows modified NASA logo - classic meatball design with red diagonal slash through it overlaid with word "LIARS" in blue/white gradient letters, explicitly accusing space agency of deception. Meme represents flat Earth belief that International Space Station is elaborate hoax, with "astronauts" actually performing in Earth-based studio using green screen technology to fake weightlessness and space environment. Claims suggest ISS livestreams showing Earth views, experiments, and crew activities are CGI composites or underwater filming with green screen backgrounds added in post-production. Argument points to occasional technical glitches in livestreams (bubbles, harness reflections, hair not floating properly) as "proof" of deception. However, extensive evidence confirms ISS reality: 1) Station visible to naked eye as bright moving point of light crossing sky in ~90-minute orbit, observable worldwide, 2) Amateur astronomers photograph ISS transiting sun/moon showing detailed station structure matching official images, 3) Radio operators communicate with ISS crew using ham radio, 4) Multiple nations operate on ISS (USA, Russia, EU, Japan, Canada) - Cold War adversaries would not collaborate on hoax, 5) Continuous crew rotation since 2000 involving 270+ astronauts from 20+ countries, 6) Scientific research conducted on station produces peer-reviewed results, 7) Supply missions from multiple commercial and governmental entities regularly dock with station (SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Russian Progress, Japanese HTV), 8) ISS cost over $150 billion to construct and operate - unsustainable for hoax. Green screen claims ignore that ISS footage shows consistent physics of microgravity: neutral buoyancy underwater training looks distinctly different from actual weightlessness (air bubbles rise, movements are slower/different, buoyancy compensators visible). Meme format designed to plant doubt about space exploration authenticity, targeting NASA specifically as primary US space agency responsible for ISS operations and public communications.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-333","title":"Other 333","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799383_470962946436778_4911407046286868769_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-332","title":"Other 332","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12799340_469031719963234_2161137336816822350_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-334","title":"Other 334","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12800299_469766833223056_7573221995986332986_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
