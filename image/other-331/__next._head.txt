5:Tad1,Bowling alley photograph showing tall vertical stack of colorful bowling balls balanced precariously on white surface with man in dark polo shirt and khaki shorts standing with arms crossed in background. Text overlay at top states "SUPPOSEDLY SPINNING 1000 MPH" and bottom text declares "YET IS COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS". Sign visible behind bowling balls reads "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" (parody of Black Lives Matter movement). Stack consists of approximately 9-10 bowling balls in various colors: blue, orange, purple, green, dark green, yellow, orange, green, dark blue/purple, red arranged vertically from bottom to top. Interior bowling alley setting shows typical features: drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting panels, pool table rules sign partially visible on wall ("No sitting on..." text fragment visible), tables and chairs, TV screen mounted on wall in background, casual recreational facility environment. Image presents classic flat Earth argument that if Earth were truly rotating at approximately 1,000 mph at equator (actual equatorial rotation speed is 1,037 mph, decreasing toward poles), we should feel this motion, and objects would be unable to remain balanced or stationary. Argument fundamentally misunderstands basic physics principle of inertial reference frames and constant velocity motion. Scientific rebuttal: Bowling balls, building, and all objects on Earth share same rotational velocity, moving together with Earth's surface - there is no relative motion between objects and ground. This is identical to why airplane passengers can walk normally in cabin of jet traveling 500+ mph - everything inside plane shares plane's velocity. Motion is only perceptible when there is acceleration (change in speed or direction). Earth's rotation is constant velocity motion (one rotation per 24 hours), so there is no acceleration felt by objects on surface. Additionally, while equatorial rotation speed is ~1,000 mph, this represents only one rotation per day - incredibly slow angular velocity (0.0007 rpm). For comparison, Earth's orbital velocity around sun is 67,000 mph, and solar system moves through galaxy at 514,000 mph, yet we perceive none of these motions because they're constant velocity. Bowling balls remain stacked because gravity (9.8 m/s² downward acceleration) holds them in place relative to Earth's surface, and all objects share Earth's rotational momentum. Centrifugal force from Earth's rotation is real but minuscule compared to gravity - only about 0.3% of gravitational force at equator, already factored into what we measure as "gravity." Image exemplifies fundamental misunderstanding: conflating high velocity with perceptibility, ignoring that constant motion is imperceptible in absence of external reference frame.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 331 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Bowling alley photograph showing tall vertical stack of colorful bowling balls balanced precariously on white surface with man in dark polo shirt and khaki s..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 331"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Bowling alley photograph showing tall vertical stack of colorful bowling balls balanced precariously on white surface with man in dark polo shirt and khaki s..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12799328_468744459991960_7273001810409829341_n.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
