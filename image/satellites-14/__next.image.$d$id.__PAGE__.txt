3:T4a1,Technical comparison diagram with white background showing size and altitude relationships between ISS, stratospheric balloons, and Earth features. Top shows International Space Station sketch (110m length) at 340km altitude marked as reference. Center shows two balloon systems: left is 'NASA ultralong duration balloon' (large light blue pumpkin-shaped balloon, 115m wide x 70m tall, volume 532,000 m³, record duration 54 days, capacity 3600kg, price $2-3 million, with parachute and payload box, operates at constant altitude resisting day-night temperature swings); right is 'World View Stratollite' (smaller teardrop balloon with solar panels, volume 22,000 m³, record duration 12 hours, capacity 50kg, price hundreds of thousands of dollars, uses solar energy to pump air and control density/altitude, can resist winds). Bottom diagram shows altitude layers: Mount Everest at ground level, Troposphere to 10km, Stratospheric winds layer to 55km, with both balloon flight paths shown navigating stratospheric winds. Demonstrates high-altitude balloon platforms operate at similar altitudes as claimed low-Earth orbit satellites, suggesting technological overlap or substitution.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"satellites-14","title":"Satellites 14","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/46289316_307812833394503_8725136047899410432_n.jpeg","description":"Meme questioning ISS photography logistics.

Bottom text: 'WHO AND WHAT CAMERA WITH CRAZY ASS SHUTTER SPEED TOOK THAT PHOTO?' Questions technical feasibility of capturing sharp, detailed photographs of ISS traveling at orbital velocity (17,000+ mph) from external perspective. Challenges who/what could photograph ISS from outside while matching its speed, what camera equipment would have sufficient shutter speed to freeze motion at that velocity, and why official ISS photos appear perfectly composed and focused rather than motion-blurred. Suggests ISS photographs may be CGI, composites, or taken in different circumstances than claimed."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-13","title":"Satellites 13","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45931638_2230561946975789_1215864701301293056_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-15","title":"Satellites 15","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/48361141_10156374359918171_3481517403718811648_n.jpeg","description":"Sarcastic meme with CGI satellite image against Earth background. Shows gold/bronze colored satellite with extended solar panel arrays orbiting above Earth's blue atmosphere with white clouds visible. Large yellow text at top: 'REMEMBER THAT TIME THEY SOLVED A CRIME USING SATELLITES?' followed by bottom yellow text: 'ME EITHER.' Dark blue gradient sky transitioning to Earth curve at bottom. Satirical commentary suggesting satellites are never actually used to solve crimes despite claims of sophisticated surveillance capabilities, questioning whether functional orbital satellites exist at all or if crime-solving satellite surveillance is fictional/exaggerated in media.
