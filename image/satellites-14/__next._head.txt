Bottom text: 'WHO AND WHAT CAMERA WITH CRAZY ASS SHUTTER SPEED TOOK THAT PHOTO?' Questions technical feasibility of capturing sharp, detailed photographs of ISS traveling at orbital velocity (17,000+ mph) from external perspective. Challenges who/what could photograph ISS from outside while matching its speed, what camera equipment would have sufficient shutter speed to freeze motion at that velocity, and why official ISS photos appear perfectly composed and focused rather than motion-blurred. Suggests ISS photographs may be CGI, composites, or taken in different circumstances than claimed."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Satellites 14"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Meme questioning ISS photography logistics.
