5:T4aa,R.E.M. song lyric meme about paradigm shift acceptance. Dramatic CGI image of Earth experiencing catastrophic destruction. Shows spherical globe Earth split/cracking with bright orange-yellow flames and explosions erupting from surface. Left side appears mostly intact showing blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents. Right side consumed by fire with massive plumes of orange flames and smoke. Bright yellow-white explosion/sunburst effect on right edge. Black starry space background with scattered stars and subtle nebula clouds visible. Top banner in gray serif font: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center shows large black serif text: 'IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL FINE'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. References R.E.M.'s 1987 song 'It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)' about accepting major changes. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests discovering Earth is flat means end of mainstream worldview but person feels liberated rather than distressed. Uses apocalyptic imagery of Earth's destruction to represent shattering of globe Earth paradigm. Argues flat Earth awakening destroys old belief system but brings peace through truth rather than fear0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 184 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"R.E.M. song lyric meme about paradigm shift acceptance.
