Center shows large gray irregular-shaped comet (potato/duck-shaped) with rough rocky surface texture. Three numbered yellow boxes mark events: '1. 15:33 - Hits the surface at 1m/s in planned location, Two anchor harpoons fail to deploy, First bounce'. '2. 17:26 - Second bounce, Displaced 1km from point of impact'. '3. 17:33 - Immobilisation, Leaning at 30% angle, Stuck in rocky zone partly in shadow'. Curved dotted lines show bounce trajectory. Speed annotations '38 cm/s' and '3 cm/s'. Bottom shows gray cratered surface with blue Philae lander and 'camera' label. Right sidebar lists technical details about mission status, scientific instruments, data transmission, battery, solar panels. Lower right text 'Use of drill put on hold'. First spacecraft to land on comet nucleus. Historic achievement in space exploration demonstrating orbital mechanics and rendezvous capabilities5:T4ce,Shel Silverstein 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' book cover with flat Earth edge imagery. Cream/beige aged paper background. Top text in serif font: 'the poems and drawings of Shel Silverstein'. Classic black ink line drawing shows whimsical scene of child and dog at literal edge of sidewalk/world. Left side has wooden signpost reading 'EDGE KEEP OFF'. Girl with pigtails wearing dress sits on edge of flat surface/cliff holding rope or leash. Small scruffy dog dangles over edge holding onto rope with mouth. Various small objects (shoes, items) fall into void below. Empty white space below represents drop-off into nothingness. Right side shows scraggly vegetation/grass. Bottom shows large black serif text: 'Where the Sidewalk Ends'. Famous 1974 children's poetry collection by Shel Silverstein. Original book about imagination and adventure where normal world ends. Flat Earth proponents use this imagery literally - suggesting Silverstein illustrated actual Earth's edge where civilization (sidewalk) meets boundary (ice wall/Antarctica). Child's innocent perspective represents truth hidden in plain sight in children's literature. Argues mainstream culture subconsciously knows Earth is flat, embedded in cultural touchstones0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-184","title":"Other 184","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525328_460139877519085_6793993696164180013_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-183","title":"Other 183","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525322_455841524615587_7426993136374706724_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-185","title":"Other 185","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525377_455802321286174_1896089488163690549_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
