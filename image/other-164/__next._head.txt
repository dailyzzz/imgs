5:T4d1,Walking Dead four-panel meme featuring Rick and Carl Grimes discussing flat Earth proof. Shows beige brick wall background with 'C BLOCK' text visible. Four vertical panels show conversation between father Rick (right, wearing blood-spattered beige/tan shirt, dark beard, disheveled appearance) and son Carl (left, wearing brown shirt and sheriff's hat). Panel 1: 'SO I HEARD YOUR FRIENDS THINK THE EARTH IS FLAT CARL?'. Panel 2: 'BUT DAD, WHAT PROOF DO WE HAVE IT'S A GLOBE?'. Panel 3: 'BECAUSE NASA TOOK A PICTURE.'. Panel 4: 'A PICTURE, CARL.' with Rick giving Carl disappointed/exasperated look. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses popular Rick and Carl meme format (usually about bad jokes/puns) to mock insufficient evidence for globe Earth. Satirizes appeal to authority by reducing all proof to single NASA photograph. Rick's condescending tone suggests accepting globe based solely on NASA images is naive or insufficient. Highlights flat Earth argument that photographic evidence can be manipulated and shouldn't be blindly trusted. Carl's innocent question represents those questioning mainstream narrative, while Rick represents those who accept authority without critical examination0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 164 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Walking Dead four-panel meme featuring Rick and Carl Grimes discussing flat Earth proof.
