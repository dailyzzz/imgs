Emotional expression conveys internal conflict and sadness. Top text in white bold letters: 'I WANT TO BELIEVE IN THE GLOBE SO MUCH'. Bottom text: 'BUT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD WON'T LET ME'. Bottom right watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Uses popular internet meme format typically reserved for trivial complaints to express cognitive dissonance between desire to accept mainstream globe Earth model and inability to reconcile it with empirical evidence/scientific methodology. Suggests person wants to conform to societal consensus about spherical Earth but rational examination of evidence prevents acceptance. Implies following scientific method (observation, experimentation, falsification) leads away from globe model toward flat Earth conclusion"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-117","title":"Other 117","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10553688_476632929203113_6327190001766255859_o.jpg","description":"Humorous two-panel comparison meme with bright blue banner reading 'THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF PEOPLE'. Left panel shows hands holding inflatable globe ball toy properly inflated, showing spherical Earth with colorful countries (pink, yellow, green, orange) on blue oceans with latitude/longitude grid lines visible. Label in green italic text: 'Ball-ievers'. Right panel shows same hands squeezing/deflating the globe ball, causing it to crumple and distort with wrinkled surface, demonstrating globe is flexible inflatable toy. Label in green italic text: 'Ball Leavers'. Top center shows 'fb.com/fematters' and 'Nick Havok' credit. Visual pun on 'believers' vs 'leavers' combined with 'ball' to create 'Ball-ievers' (those who believe in globe/ball Earth) versus 'Ball Leavers' (those who leave/reject ball Earth concept). Uses deflatable toy globe to suggest spherical Earth model is as insubstantial and easily collapsed as cheap inflatable toy"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-119","title":"Other 119","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10623436_477726199093786_8066050437528076949_o.jpg","description":"Satirical photograph showing person wearing bright orange NASA-style spacesuit with white helmet and clear visor, sitting at wooden desk/table in library setting. Extensive bookshelves filled with books visible in background. Person holds and reads yellow book titled 'Space Exploration for Actors' by Tim Dodd (visible on cover: 'Making Everything Easier - Premier Edition', National Geographic branding). Stack of space-themed books on desk including titles like 'What If The Moon Didn't Exist', 'Origins', 'A Guide to the Universe', and others with 'COSMO' visible. Bottom watermarks show 'fb.com/fematters' twice and 'JM' logo. Satirical image suggesting astronauts and space program are theatrical performances requiring acting training rather than genuine space exploration. Implies NASA missions are staged productions with astronauts as actors reading scripts in studios, not scientific expeditions. Uses absurdist humor to question authenticity of space program"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
