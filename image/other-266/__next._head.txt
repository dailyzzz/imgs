5:T706,Matrix Agent Smith meme about flat Earth censorship. Popular internet meme format using scene from 1999 film The Matrix showing multiple identical Agent Smith characters. Image displays army of Agent Smith clones - approximately 30+ identical figures wearing black suits, white dress shirts, black ties, and dark sunglasses arranged in rows. Figures shown from chest up. All have same pale complexion, short dark hair, stoic serious expressions. Lead agent in center foreground appears slightly larger/closer to camera. Background shows green-tinted interior setting suggesting Matrix environment. Lighting creates somewhat dark, ominous atmosphere. Agents appear unnaturally uniform and synchronized, representing system's enforcers who eliminate threats to established reality. Top text in large bold white letters: 'WHEN YOU POST ABOUT FLAT EARTH'. Bottom text: 'THESE GUYS START LEAVING NEGATIVE COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE TO START WAKING UP'. Lower right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white italics. Meme positions flat Earth believers as Neo-like truth-tellers fighting against system, while critics are Agent Smith-like defenders of official narrative. Suggests coordinated organized opposition trying to suppress flat Earth information to prevent mass awakening. Common conspiracy theory trope where any criticism is reframed as proof of cover-up. In Matrix film, Agent Smiths represent system attempting to maintain control over humans trapped in simulation. Meme draws parallel between Matrix's false reality and alleged false globe Earth model. Implies critics aren't genuine individuals but coordinated agents serving hidden agenda. Reality: critics are independent people pointing out scientific errors in flat Earth claims, not coordinated suppression campaign0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 266 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Matrix Agent Smith meme about flat Earth censorship.
