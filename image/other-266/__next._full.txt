13:T706,Matrix Agent Smith meme about flat Earth censorship. Popular internet meme format using scene from 1999 film The Matrix showing multiple identical Agent Smith characters. Image displays army of Agent Smith clones - approximately 30+ identical figures wearing black suits, white dress shirts, black ties, and dark sunglasses arranged in rows. Figures shown from chest up. All have same pale complexion, short dark hair, stoic serious expressions. Lead agent in center foreground appears slightly larger/closer to camera. Background shows green-tinted interior setting suggesting Matrix environment. Lighting creates somewhat dark, ominous atmosphere. Agents appear unnaturally uniform and synchronized, representing system's enforcers who eliminate threats to established reality. Top text in large bold white letters: 'WHEN YOU POST ABOUT FLAT EARTH'. Bottom text: 'THESE GUYS START LEAVING NEGATIVE COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE TO START WAKING UP'. Lower right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white italics. Meme positions flat Earth believers as Neo-like truth-tellers fighting against system, while critics are Agent Smith-like defenders of official narrative. Suggests coordinated organized opposition trying to suppress flat Earth information to prevent mass awakening. Common conspiracy theory trope where any criticism is reframed as proof of cover-up. In Matrix film, Agent Smiths represent system attempting to maintain control over humans trapped in simulation. Meme draws parallel between Matrix's false reality and alleged false globe Earth model. Implies critics aren't genuine individuals but coordinated agents serving hidden agenda. Reality: critics are independent people pointing out scientific errors in flat Earth claims, not coordinated suppression campaign14:T9b8,Flight paths comparison between globe and flat Earth map. Split-screen comparison of airline routes questioning globe Earth model. Top text spans both panels: 'THESE ARE THE FLIGHT PATHS ON A GLOBE. THEY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.' and 'SAME FLIGHTS ON A FLAT EARTH MAP. WHICH ONE MAKES MORE SENSE?'. Left panel shows Mercator projection map with blue oceans, green continents. Red curved lines trace flight routes originating from lower left (appears to be Auckland, New Zealand) fanning outward to various destinations in Americas. Routes curve across Pacific Ocean showing great circle paths: New Zealand to western USA (Alaska, Seattle, San Francisco area), central USA (possibly Texas area), southern USA, Mexico, Central America, and South America (Chile/Argentina area). Five distinct red curved paths visible. Geographic labels include 'United States', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Peru', 'Chile', 'Argentina', 'Venezuela', 'Colombia', 'Puerto Rico', 'Cuba', 'North Pacific Ocean', 'North Atlantic Ocean', 'South Pacific Ocean', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Coral Sea', 'Tasman Sea', 'New Zealand'. Map uses standard latitude/longitude grid. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Right panel displays azimuthal equidistant projection (common flat Earth map) centered on North Pole. Continents radiate outward from central white circle (Arctic). Same red flight routes now appear as more direct straight or gently curved lines across projection. Routes from Australia/New Zealand region to Americas look shorter and more direct compared to globe paths. Dark blue ocean, tan/green continents, white ice. Latitude/longitude grid visible. Flat Earth argument claims airlines would fly different routes if Earth were sphere - routes appear longer and more circuitous on globe but direct on flat map. However, this is projection distortion illusion. On globe, great circle routes (shortest distance between two points on sphere) appear as straight lines from above but as curves on 2D Mercator map. Azimuthal projection from South Pole perspective would show these routes as straight lines because it preserves distances from center point, but distorts everywhere else. Airlines actually DO fly great circle routes shown on globe - these ARE the shortest paths when measured on spherical surface. Flat Earth map is itself a projection of spherical Earth data, just using different projection center. Either projection can make routes look 'wrong' if you don't understand how map projections work15:T7f7,Dubai skyline aerial photograph with flat Earth claim. Aerial/elevated photograph of Dubai, United Arab Emirates showing expansive cityscape. Center-left features iconic Burj Khalifa - world's tallest building at 828 meters (2,717 feet) appearing as distinctive tall spire with tapering design rising dramatically above surrounding buildings. Dense cluster of modern skyscrapers surrounds Burj Khalifa forming downtown Dubai skyline. Multiple high-rise towers visible showing glass, steel, concrete construction. Buildings decrease in height moving away from center creating skyline profile. Foreground shows lower-rise development with visible street grid pattern, some greenspace, residential areas. Middle ground shows more urban development, roads, infrastructure spreading outward. Background extends to distant horizon showing flat desert landscape fading into atmospheric haze. Sky occupies upper half - gradient from darker blue-gray at top to lighter white-gray near horizon suggesting either early morning/late afternoon lighting or atmospheric dust/pollution. Haze creates layers of decreasing visibility with distance. Lower right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT AND THAT IS THAT'. Photograph appears to be taken from aircraft, tall building, or drone at significant elevation (possibly 1000+ feet) looking toward downtown Dubai from northeast or east direction. Flat Earth argument uses long-distance visibility as 'proof' - claims visible horizon distance would be limited by curvature on sphere. However, from elevation of ~1000 feet, geometric horizon is approximately 39 miles away. Atmospheric refraction extends this further. Dubai skyline and desert landscape visible within this range. Earth's curvature of 8 inches per mile squared only becomes visually apparent at much greater distances or altitudes. Photograph actually demonstrates atmospheric perspective (things become hazier with distance) rather than proving flat Earth9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-266","title":"Other 266","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716072_464231873776552_7313360567585154295_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-265","title":"Other 265","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716056_466523323547407_2508931254555573126_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-267","title":"Other 267","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716330_462744343925305_5487955060240283810_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
