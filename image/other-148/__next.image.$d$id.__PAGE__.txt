3:T488,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to look downwards at the horizon'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe4:T4cd,Satirical composite image showing massive crowd bowing in worship toward giant inflatable globe above US Capitol building. Shows green lawn of National Mall with hundreds of people in various colored clothing (blue, green, white, black, yellow, purple shirts) all bowing forward on hands and knees in prayer/prostration position facing Capitol. White neoclassical US Capitol building with iconic dome visible in background under blue sky with white clouds. Trees line sides of scene. Massive light blue inflatable globe balloon hovers/floats above Capitol building showing South America continent prominently in brown/green. Globe appears weathered or patched. Top right watermark 'fb.com/fematters' and 'JM' logo. Bottom text in huge bold white letters: 'BALLIEVERS'. Satirical portage compares belief in spherical Earth to religious worship/idolatry. 'Ballievers' is pun on 'ball' (sphere) and 'believers', suggesting globe Earth acceptance is faith-based rather than evidence-based. Image mocks those who accept mainstream cosmology as unquestioning devotees engaged in quasi-religious submission to false god (globe Earth). Crowd's uniform bowing suggests herd mentality and social conformity rather than independent thinking5:T4a3,Falling Down movie meme featuring Michael Douglas as character D-FENS/William Foster. Shows Douglas in iconic scene standing on grassy hill with urban skyline visible in hazy purple-blue background. Character wears white short-sleeve dress shirt, dark striped tie, black pants, thick-framed glasses. Hair slicked back, stern expression on face. Holds black briefcase in right hand, rifle/weapon in left hand. Green grass and small tree visible in foreground. Cityscape buildings create misty backdrop. Image captures moment of character's breakdown and rejection of society. Top text in large outlined white letters: 'WHEN YOU REALIZE'. Top right shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark. Bottom text: 'THEY LIED ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH'. References Falling Down's themes of discovering uncomfortable truths about society and rejecting mainstream narratives. Character's armed rebellion against societal norms parallels flat Earth awakening narrative of discovering deception. Uses Michael Douglas' intense expression and armed stance to convey anger at perceived lies about Earth's shape. Suggests flat Earth realization leads to fundamental questioning of all authority and institutions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-148","title":"Other 148","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440454_455797657953307_2589827333278940772_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-147","title":"Other 147","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440282_476185589247847_4628853777349366684_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-149","title":"Other 149","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440586_477157479150658_7825537357449352860_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
