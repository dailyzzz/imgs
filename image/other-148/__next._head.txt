5:T488,Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument. Shows commercial airplane wing extending into frame from right side - white underside with dark blue/navy wingtip visible. Below wing shows sprawling cityscape with buildings, streets, and infrastructure visible in golden-hour lighting. Sky displays spectacular gradient from deep blue at top transitioning through pink-purple tones to bright orange-yellow near horizon. Thin layer of haze or smog visible over city. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level, positioned at same height as viewer's eye level. Top text in white: 'The horizon is always at eye level with the observer.' Bottom text: 'If the Earth were a globe, an observer who should ascend above its surface would have to look downwards at the horizon'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Argues that on spherical Earth, rising altitude should cause horizon to drop below eye level, requiring observer to look down to see it. Claims horizon remaining at eye level regardless of altitude proves flat Earth. Suggests curvature should be more apparent from airplane cruising altitude if Earth were globe0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 148 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Aerial photograph from airplane window at sunset with eye-level horizon argument.
