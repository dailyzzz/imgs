3:T4a5,Satirical Pear Earth Society logo parody. White background with black serif text at top: 'THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY' and 'thepearearthsociety.org' website. Center shows circular emblem with black outline. Inside circle sits pear-shaped Earth illustration - irregular lumpy blue-green globe with continents visible including orange Australia, resembling actual pear fruit shape with stem at top (North Pole area). Blue represents oceans, green/gray shows landmasses. Bottom banner ribbon across circle displays Latin motto 'IN VERITATE VICTORIA' (In Truth Victory). Bottom right watermark 'Flat Earth Matters' in light gray. Parodies Flat Earth Society by proposing equally absurd alternative Earth shape. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (pear-shaped due to equatorial bulge), which flat Earth proponents mock as excuse for why Earth doesn't look perfectly spherical in photos. Satirizes how mainstream science keeps modifying Earth's shape description (perfect sphere → oblate spheroid → pear-shaped) to explain photographic inconsistencies. Uses humor to suggest if scientists can claim Earth is pear-shaped, flat Earth is no more absurd4:T465,Humorous upside-down Google Maps car reflection photo. Shows white Google Street View mapping vehicle with distinctive roof-mounted camera rig, multicolored Google Maps livery (green text reading 'Google Maps' visible on side), and black wheels. Vehicle appears upside-down as photographed in water reflection/puddle on asphalt road surface. Gray pavement visible at top (actually ground). Reflection shows perfect mirror image with brown/tan dried grass or field visible in background of reflection. Top text in bold white letters: 'GOOGLE MAPS'. Bottom text in large white letters: 'AUSTRALIA'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Satirical meme mocking globe Earth model's implication that Australia (southern hemisphere) is upside-down relative to northern hemisphere. Plays on common flat Earth joke about Australians living upside-down on bottom of spinning ball. Uses clever visual of reflected vehicle to represent how absurd it would be for people to actually live inverted. Suggests flat Earth model makes more sense because all people stand upright on same plane rather than at various angles around sphere5:T4cd,Four-panel comparison of Felix Baumgartner's Red Bull Stratos space jump questioning curvature. Shows Austrian skydiver during record-breaking 2012 jump from stratosphere (128,100 feet). All panels show Baumgartner in white spacesuit with Red Bull branding, attached to capsule/balloon equipment. Top-left panel: astronaut against Earth backdrop with text 'NO CURVATURE' - horizon appears flat. Top-right panel: similar angle showing flat horizon. Bottom-left panel: marked 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS', shows different camera angle with curved horizon visible, labeled 'CURVATURE'. Bottom-right panel: shows pronounced curved horizon with blue atmospheric glow. All images show brown-tan landmass below, deep blue sky/space above, white stratospheric haze. 'ZENITH' visible on equipment. Argues Red Bull Stratos footage shows inconsistent horizon curvature depending on camera/lens used. Questions why some angles show flat horizon while others show curve from same altitude. Flat Earth proponents claim curved images result from fisheye lens distortion rather than actual Earth curvature. Suggests deliberate deception using camera tricks to make Earth appear spherical when straight-lens footage shows flat horizon at 24-mile altitude0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-166","title":"Other 166","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12495251_468500190016387_8278333110528552931_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-165","title":"Other 165","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12493861_454243174775422_2440540554143726316_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-167","title":"Other 167","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12496200_460126534187086_82579205709002182_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
