Shows five CGI renderings of Chinese Yutu rover/lander in bright yellow with blue solar panels and red Chinese flag on gray lunar surface with black space background. Right panels show comparisons to Apollo-era lunar module (gold/bronze with landing legs on moon surface) and bottom right shows crowd of Chinese officials/engineers in white shirts at mission control center celebrating. Bottom red banner text: 'OF COURSE NOT, IT WAS SO FAKE THE MEDIA DIDN'T EVEN COVER IT' suggesting Chinese moon landing was fabricated CGI with such obvious fakery that mainstream media avoided covering it, implying low-quality computer graphics rather than actual lunar photography. Extends moon landing skepticism from Apollo to modern Chinese space program."},"prevImage":{"id":"the-moon-6","title":"The Moon 6","category":"the-moon","categoryDisplay":"The Moon","src":"/images/gallery/the-moon/42340574_2229821197295419_3964013763463479296_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'NASA SECRETS' comparing Apollo moon landing photos. Top panel shows classic photograph: astronaut in white spacesuit descending lunar module ladder onto moon surface, gold/bronze colored lunar module with crinkled foil visible, blue Earth rising in black sky background, gray lunar surface. Bottom panel shows same scene in false-color thermal/infrared imaging with vivid neon colors: green ground, bright blue and magenta astronaut figure, yellow-green lunar module. Text overlay: 'OBVIOUS FAKERY! WAKE UP TO APOLLO!' Suggests thermal imaging reveals Apollo photographs were taken in studio with artificial lighting rather than moon's environment, claiming color analysis exposes fakery. Implies temperature/lighting signatures in images are inconsistent with lunar conditions when analyzed through infrared/thermal visualization techniques."},"nextImage":{"id":"the-moon-8","title":"The Moon 8","category":"the-moon","categoryDisplay":"The Moon","src":"/images/gallery/the-moon/43180768_2034338666609206_3387664319532498944_n.jpeg","description":"Educational meme titled 'HUMANS WENT TO THE MOON?' with moon image on right, listing thermosphere temperature range 500-2000°C in red, followed by metal melting temperatures in blue: Lead 327°C, Magnesium 650°C, Aluminum 660°C, Alum.
