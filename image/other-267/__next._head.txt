5:T7f7,Dubai skyline aerial photograph with flat Earth claim. Aerial/elevated photograph of Dubai, United Arab Emirates showing expansive cityscape. Center-left features iconic Burj Khalifa - world's tallest building at 828 meters (2,717 feet) appearing as distinctive tall spire with tapering design rising dramatically above surrounding buildings. Dense cluster of modern skyscrapers surrounds Burj Khalifa forming downtown Dubai skyline. Multiple high-rise towers visible showing glass, steel, concrete construction. Buildings decrease in height moving away from center creating skyline profile. Foreground shows lower-rise development with visible street grid pattern, some greenspace, residential areas. Middle ground shows more urban development, roads, infrastructure spreading outward. Background extends to distant horizon showing flat desert landscape fading into atmospheric haze. Sky occupies upper half - gradient from darker blue-gray at top to lighter white-gray near horizon suggesting either early morning/late afternoon lighting or atmospheric dust/pollution. Haze creates layers of decreasing visibility with distance. Lower right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT AND THAT IS THAT'. Photograph appears to be taken from aircraft, tall building, or drone at significant elevation (possibly 1000+ feet) looking toward downtown Dubai from northeast or east direction. Flat Earth argument uses long-distance visibility as 'proof' - claims visible horizon distance would be limited by curvature on sphere. However, from elevation of ~1000 feet, geometric horizon is approximately 39 miles away. Atmospheric refraction extends this further. Dubai skyline and desert landscape visible within this range. Earth's curvature of 8 inches per mile squared only becomes visually apparent at much greater distances or altitudes. Photograph actually demonstrates atmospheric perspective (things become hazier with distance) rather than proving flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 267 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dubai skyline aerial photograph with flat Earth claim.
