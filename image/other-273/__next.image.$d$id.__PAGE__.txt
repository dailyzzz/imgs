3:T84d,Toy Story Buzz Lightyear gravitational waves detection meme. Popular internet meme format using characters from Pixar's Toy Story animated film franchise. Image shows Woody (left) and Buzz Lightyear (right) standing together. Woody is cowboy doll wearing brown cow-print vest, yellow shirt, blue jeans, red bandana, brown cowboy hat with sheriff badge. He has concerned skeptical expression with raised eyebrow looking at Buzz. Buzz Lightyear is space ranger action figure wearing white and green futuristic space suit with purple and red accents, purple hood/helmet, colorful control buttons on chest. Buzz stands with arms outstretched in his characteristic heroic pose pointing upward and outward with confident enthusiastic expression. Background shows blurred tan/beige desert landscape suggesting outdoor scene from film. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Bottom text in same style: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES EVERYWHERE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme references Buzz's famous line from Toy Story: 'X, X everywhere!' format (originally 'Lasers, lasers everywhere!' or fan-made 'X, X everywhere' variants). Format used to describe something that's suddenly everywhere or being over-applied. In this context, mocking 2016 announcement of gravitational waves detection by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's General Relativity, first directly detected September 2015 from merging black holes. Discovery won 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth community skeptical of gravitational waves since they: 1) require spacetime to exist (flat Earth models reject relativity), 2) confirm predictions of Einstein's gravity theory which flat Earthers dismiss, 3) detected by sophisticated instruments flat Earthers distrust. Meme suggests scientists invoke gravitational waves too frequently as explanation or that concept is being overused in media. However, gravitational wave astronomy is legitimate field with multiple confirmed detections opening new way to observe universe4:T848,Flat Earth analemma diagram showing sun's annual path with seasons. Educational cosmological diagram illustrating sun's movement through calendar year in flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows analemma pattern - figure-8 or infinity symbol path traced by sun's position throughout year. Path formed by 24 yellow-cream circular dots representing sun positions at different dates, each dot same size. Pattern displays two loops - upper loop wider than lower loop, connected at center creating characteristic analemma shape. Month labels positioned around pattern in clockwise order starting from top: DECEMBER at top center (winter), JANUARY upper right, FEBRUARY middle right, MARCH lower right, APRIL bottom center, MAY lower left, JUNE bottom center, JULY middle right of lower loop, AUGUST lower right, SEPTEMBER middle left, OCTOBER upper left, NOVEMBER upper middle left, returning to DECEMBER. Two curved bracket symbols drawn within loops suggesting sun's circular/elliptical paths. Four season labels in corners: AUTUMN (upper left, orange text), WINTER (upper right, light blue text), SPRING (lower left, green text), SUMMER (lower right, white text). Bottom subtitle on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Beige border frames entire diagram with vintage aesthetic. Analemma is figure-8 pattern traced by sun's position in sky when photographed from same location at same time each day over year. In reality, analemma results from Earth's axial tilt (23.5°) combined with elliptical orbit causing slight variations in solar noon timing. On spherical Earth, analemma demonstrates planet's orbital mechanics. Flat Earth models struggle to explain analemma formation since their proposed sun movements (circular path above disc) wouldn't produce this pattern. This diagram attempts to show sun following figure-8 path above flat Earth, but provides no mechanism for why sun would trace this specific path or how it creates seasons. Scientific analemma photography consistently shows pattern proving Earth's tilt and elliptical orbit5:T819,Large azimuthal equidistant projection map displayed on urban building. Photograph showing massive world map displayed on exterior wall of multi-story building in city setting. Map uses azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole - same projection commonly used by flat Earth community. Map appears as large circular disc with white/cream border showing compass directions with decorative sun symbols at cardinal points. North Pole at center (white) with continents radiating outward. Africa prominently displayed in orange/brown tones center-left. Asia in yellow-green tones across upper portion. Europe visible in smaller scale. North and South America in green tones on right side. Australia in yellow-orange lower portion. Antarctica not shown as continent - outer ring represents Antarctic region. Map shows political boundaries with countries in different colors. Ocean areas in light blue. Latitude/longitude grid lines visible as black curves radiating from center and concentric circles. Map appears to be large advertisement, mural, or educational display mounted on concrete/glass building facade. Building shows modern architecture with visible windows, air conditioning units. Street level visible at bottom showing pedestrians walking on sidewalk - approximately 6-8 people visible as small figures giving scale to massive map (appears 30-40 feet in diameter). Yellow taxi cab motion-blurred in foreground driving past on street. Street lamp and traffic infrastructure visible. Background shows more urban buildings. Sky appears overcast/hazy typical of city atmosphere. Map projection is legitimate cartographic tool used for aviation and radio communication because it accurately shows distances from center point. United Nations logo uses this projection. However, flat Earth community adopted this specific projection as 'true' map of Earth, misunderstanding that it's 2D representation of 3D sphere, not actual Earth shape. Projection severely distorts sizes and shapes away from center - Australia, South America, Antarctica appear stretched0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-273","title":"Other 273","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717709_463444777188595_8211548813359873487_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-272","title":"Other 272","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717648_464902217042851_3090432165187052994_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-274","title":"Other 274","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717740_465255460340860_1563648932534546304_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
