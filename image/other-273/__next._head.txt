5:T84d,Toy Story Buzz Lightyear gravitational waves detection meme. Popular internet meme format using characters from Pixar's Toy Story animated film franchise. Image shows Woody (left) and Buzz Lightyear (right) standing together. Woody is cowboy doll wearing brown cow-print vest, yellow shirt, blue jeans, red bandana, brown cowboy hat with sheriff badge. He has concerned skeptical expression with raised eyebrow looking at Buzz. Buzz Lightyear is space ranger action figure wearing white and green futuristic space suit with purple and red accents, purple hood/helmet, colorful control buttons on chest. Buzz stands with arms outstretched in his characteristic heroic pose pointing upward and outward with confident enthusiastic expression. Background shows blurred tan/beige desert landscape suggesting outdoor scene from film. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES'. Bottom text in same style: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVES EVERYWHERE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme references Buzz's famous line from Toy Story: 'X, X everywhere!' format (originally 'Lasers, lasers everywhere!' or fan-made 'X, X everywhere' variants). Format used to describe something that's suddenly everywhere or being over-applied. In this context, mocking 2016 announcement of gravitational waves detection by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's General Relativity, first directly detected September 2015 from merging black holes. Discovery won 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth community skeptical of gravitational waves since they: 1) require spacetime to exist (flat Earth models reject relativity), 2) confirm predictions of Einstein's gravity theory which flat Earthers dismiss, 3) detected by sophisticated instruments flat Earthers distrust. Meme suggests scientists invoke gravitational waves too frequently as explanation or that concept is being overused in media. However, gravitational wave astronomy is legitimate field with multiple confirmed detections opening new way to observe universe0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 273 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Toy Story Buzz Lightyear gravitational waves detection meme.
