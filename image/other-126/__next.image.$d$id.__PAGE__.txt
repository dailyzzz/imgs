Character has unlit cigarette or toothpick in mouth, facial expression shows skeptical or questioning look with wide eyes staring at camera. Blurred green foliage background suggests jungle or forest setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'YOU CAN'T SEE THE CURVATURE BECAUSE THE EARTH IS TOO BIG?' Bottom text: 'BUT YOU CAN SEE SHIPS SAIL OVER THE HORIZON?' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters' and 'JM' logo. Meme points out perceived logical contradiction in mainstream explanation for why Earth's curvature isn't visible from ground level (too large to perceive) versus claim that ships disappearing over horizon proves curvature. Argues if Earth is too big to see curvature, horizon effects shouldn't be observable either. Uses Downey's skeptical expression to convey disbelief in contradictory reasoning"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-125","title":"Other 125","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12308575_440115539521519_863422895479152296_n.jpg","description":"Simple black and white diagram comparing curved versus flat surface over distance. Top illustration shows curved line representing Earth's curvature with points labeled 'B' on left and 'A' on right. Curved arc between them labeled '5 miles' showing height of arc. Straight line distance across top of arc labeled '6 miles'. Diagram includes small structures at points B and A (possibly buildings or observation points) labeled with 'C' above. Bottom illustration shows flat horizontal line between same points B and A with straight '6 miles' distance labeled, representing flat Earth model. Visual demonstrates geometric difference: on curved surface, straight-line distance (6 miles) differs from arc length, while on flat surface they would be same. Illustrates how curvature should create measurable difference in distances if Earth is spherical versus flat"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-127","title":"Other 127","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12310715_440635202802886_373327189041559097_n.jpg","description":"Contemplative silhouetted photograph with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in bold white letters at top. Shows lone person standing on dark rocky coastal outcrop at sunset or sunrise. Person appears as complete silhouette in profile facing right, looking out over ocean. Sky features beautiful gradient transitioning from deep blue at top through lighter blue-purple in middle to warm orange-pink-peach tones near horizon. Scattered wispy clouds visible in upper sky. Ocean water shows subtle wave motion with white foam. Rocky formation in foreground appears dark brown-black, rugged and textured. Horizon line between ocean and sky appears perfectly flat and level, stretching across entire width of image. Composition creates contemplative, philosophical mood suggesting person pondering nature of reality and Earth's true shape. Silhouette format emphasizes universal human search for truth. Peaceful natural setting contrasts with controversial subject matter"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
