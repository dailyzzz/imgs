5:T41f,Dr. Evil meme from Austin Powers questioning NASA budget allocation. Shows Mike Myers as Dr. Evil character wearing iconic light blue-gray suit with high collar, bald head. Character holds pinky finger to corner of mouth in signature gesture with satisfied smirk expression. Blurred gray-blue background suggests lair/headquarters setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016'. Bottom text: '19.3 BILLION DOLLARS...' with ellipsis suggesting suspicion about fund usage. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme uses Dr. Evil's character (comedic villain known for exaggerated ransom demands and evil schemes) to suggest NASA's budget is excessive or fraudulently obtained. Implies massive government funding goes toward maintaining space exploration deception rather than genuine science. Question mark hanging over dollar amount suggests money is being misused or embezzled. Uses comedy villain to make NASA seem cartoonishly evil rather than legitimate scientific organization0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 152 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dr. Evil meme from Austin Powers questioning NASA budget allocation.
