3:T41f,Dr. Evil meme from Austin Powers questioning NASA budget allocation. Shows Mike Myers as Dr. Evil character wearing iconic light blue-gray suit with high collar, bald head. Character holds pinky finger to corner of mouth in signature gesture with satisfied smirk expression. Blurred gray-blue background suggests lair/headquarters setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016'. Bottom text: '19.3 BILLION DOLLARS...' with ellipsis suggesting suspicion about fund usage. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme uses Dr. Evil's character (comedic villain known for exaggerated ransom demands and evil schemes) to suggest NASA's budget is excessive or fraudulently obtained. Implies massive government funding goes toward maintaining space exploration deception rather than genuine science. Question mark hanging over dollar amount suggests money is being misused or embezzled. Uses comedy villain to make NASA seem cartoonishly evil rather than legitimate scientific organization4:T4b1,Stunning aerial landscape photograph from mountain/elevated viewpoint with flat Earth messaging. Shows dramatic coastal scene - left side features massive layered sedimentary rock cliff face with tan, brown, and gray horizontal strata visible. Mountain extends down slope covered in green vegetation. Right side shows brilliant turquoise-blue ocean water meeting dark coastline with white wave breaks visible along shore. Small coastal town/settlement visible at base of mountain with white buildings clustered together. Ocean extends to perfectly flat horizon line under bright blue sky with scattered white wispy clouds. Sunlight creates beautiful atmospheric perspective. Top text in large white letters with subtle shadow: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. Center text: 'RESEARCH IT!' in white outlined letters. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses spectacular natural beauty to attract attention to flat Earth message. Horizon appears flat in photograph (as it would from any viewpoint regardless of Earth's shape). Encourages viewers to independently investigate rather than accept mainstream narrative. Juxtaposition of beautiful landscape with controversial message creates cognitive dissonance0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-152","title":"Other 152","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12466283_454476978085375_7688683053710238504_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-151","title":"Other 151","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440787_503315173201555_6202945621858404569_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist absurdist humor meme with white/light gray background. Shows large bold outlined text in three lines. Top line in huge letters: 'UNBELIEVABLE!' Second line in large gray outlined text: 'MY KITCHEN TABLE'. Third line: 'IS A SPHERE!' Bottom portion shows curved edge of dark brown wooden table surface suggesting round/spherical shape. Middle of image shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark in white text. Sarcastic meme using reductio ad absurdum argument. Mocks mainstream science by applying sphere logic to everyday flat objects. Argues that just as obviously flat kitchen table would be absurd to call spherical, so too is calling Earth a sphere when it appears flat to human observation. Uses simple household object analogy to make globe Earth seem ridiculous. Employs exaggerated disbelief ('UNBELIEVABLE!') to suggest claiming sphericity for observably flat objects is preposterous. Implies direct sensory experience (table is flat) should override scientific models (Earth is sphere)"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-153","title":"Other 153","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12471743_455240954675644_7637157316831754820_o.jpg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
