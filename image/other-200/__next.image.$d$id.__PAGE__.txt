3:T54f,Office Space Napoleon Dynamite-style meme about flat Earth media coverage. Shows character from Office Space (1999) in classic nerdy office worker aesthetic. Man wears light blue button-up collared shirt, large rectangular wire-frame glasses with thick lenses. Has brown hair, thin mustache, awkward facial expression - slight smile, eyes looking to side. Background shows blurred office environment with fluorescent lighting, gray/beige walls, retail or office store setting. Visible shelves with products, doors in background. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'FLAT EARTH WAS ON YAHOO TODAY'. Bottom text: 'SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THINGS ARE GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS'. Bottom right corner shows 'JM' watermark. Bottom left: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. References Napoleon Dynamite (2004) famous quote about his girlfriend in Canada who he met on chat roulette - 'so I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious' - delivered in deadpan monotone. Applies awkward-nerd humor to flat Earth movement gaining mainstream media attention. Yahoo was major news portal in mid-2010s. Suggests flat Earth discussion appearing on mainstream platforms represents validation or breakthrough moment. Self-aware humor acknowledging flat Earth is fringe topic, but also celebrates any media coverage as progress toward broader public awareness4:T68b,Academic paper excerpt questioning geocentric cosmology through quasar redshift analysis. White background with black text showing first page of scholarly article. Title in bold capitals: 'THE RED SHIFT HYPOTHESIS FOR QUASARS: IS THE EARTH THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE?' Author listed as 'Y. P. VARSHNI' from 'Department of Physics, University of Ottawa, Canada'. Date stamp '(Received 10 September, 1975)' below author. Abstract section discusses cosmological interpretation of quasar redshift spectra leading to paradoxical result that Earth is center of Universe. Text mentions Einstein's criteria for good theory - external confirmation and inner perfection or 'logical simplicity' or 'naturalness'. Quote attributed to 'G. Holton (1973)'. Main body discusses G. Burbidge (1968) pointing out absorption-line red shifts at specific values (1.95, 1.55). Mentions four quasars (Ton 153, PKS 0119-04, PHL 938, 3C 232) whose emission-line red shifts cluster around 1.955. Discusses probability calculations for chance coincidence of four emission-line red shifts at 1.955. Includes mathematical equation labeled (1) for probability calculation.

This paper explores whether quasar redshift data paradoxically suggests special position for Earth, challenging cosmological principle that Universe appears same from all locations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-200","title":"Other 200","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12592309_457896594410080_2855930619533916639_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-199","title":"Other 199","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12573106_456307294569010_3300982156691450522_n.jpg","description":"A serene arctic or polar seascape at sunset featuring a flat, unbroken horizon line with the sun setting directly at center.
