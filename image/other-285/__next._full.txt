13:T851,DIY Hubble Space Telescope satirical assembly instructions meme. Humorous infographic mocking Hubble Space Telescope construction with everyday household items. Top banner in bright cyan blue with yellow handwritten-style text 'DO IT YOURSELF' and large white bold text 'HUBBLE TELESCOPE!' Below shows six panels with white backgrounds separated by black borders, each containing simple 3D rendered illustration of common object with label underneath. Panel 1: Washing machine drum - metallic cylindrical drum with perforated holes, labeled '1. Washing Machine Drum'. Panel 2: Aluminum foil - roll of shiny silver foil partially unrolled, labeled '2. Aluminum Foil'. Panel 3: Toilet seat lid - white oval plastic toilet seat cover, labeled '3. Toilet Seat Lid'. Panel 4: TV dish antenna - gray satellite dish on stand, labeled '4. T.V. Dish Antenna'. Panel 5: Curved lens - gray convex optical lens shown in profile, labeled '5. Curved Lens'. Panel 6: Solar panels - black rectangular photovoltaic panel array, labeled '6. Solar Panels'. Lower portion shows black background with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white at upper right. Center displays photograph of actual Hubble Space Telescope in orbit - cylindrical spacecraft with distinctive solar panel wings, metallic gold-brown thermal insulation wrapping, various instruments and antennae protruding. Large white handwritten text 'Voila!' suggests final assembled product. Bottom shows red banner 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical meme suggests Hubble telescope crudely assembled from cheap household items rather than sophisticated optical instrument. Implies space telescope imagery is fake, produced by low-budget contraption. However, Hubble launched 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery, built over decade by thousands of engineers at cost of $4.7 billion (inflation-adjusted ~$10B today). Contains 2.4-meter precision mirror, advanced spectrographs, infrared/ultraviolet cameras, operates in low Earth orbit at 547 km altitude. Has captured over 1.5 million observations transforming astronomy. Meme dismisses extraordinary engineering achievement as fraudulent apparatus14:T847,Dog nose versus black holes comparison mocking LIGO gravitational wave detection. Satirical image comparing LIGO's gravitational wave detection visualization to dog nose photograph. Image split into three sections. Top section shows close-up photograph of dog's nose in black and white - two nostrils appear as dark holes separated by median groove, textured wet skin around nostrils with visible pores and bumpy surface typical of canine rhinarium. Top text in white typewriter-style font: '2 Black holes...??? Or Dog nose...!!!' with multiple question marks and exclamation points suggesting skepticism. Middle section shows quote in white text: '"By the way, this is not a Hollywood production that I am going to show you..."' appears to be quote from scientist discussing LIGO detection. Text suggests speaker emphasizing authenticity of upcoming image. News ticker visible showing 'Sky NEWS' logo, time stamp 'LIVE 10:37', stock price '5590.36'. Bottom section displays LIGO's famous gravitational wave visualization - computer-generated image showing two dark circular regions (black holes) creating warped spacetime effect on dark gray/brown granular background resembling gravel or cosmic dust. Visualization shows merger of two black holes with distortion patterns radiating outward. Large white text overlaid: 'NASA LIES'. Below: 'Research your Flat and Stationary Earth'. Bottom news banner: 'SPACE BREAKTHROUGH' with red background, white text explaining 'THE EXISTENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES WAS FIRST PREDICTED BY ALBERT EINSTEIN A CENTURY' and additional scrolling text about Jeremy Corbyn and junior doctors. Attribution: 'Karlee Sunshine Midreno'. Meme mocks resemblance between dog nose and LIGO visualization suggesting detection image is fake or dog nose. However, similarity is superficial - LIGO image shows computer simulation of spacetime curvature from actual interferometer data detecting ripples from black hole merger 1.3 billion light-years away. Detection confirmed Einstein's century-old prediction, won Nobel Prize. Visual similarity to dog nose doesn't invalidate scientific measurement15:T8d5,Numbers and geometric structures diagram showing angles in digits with Fibonacci and prime number notation. Educational mathematical diagram displaying numbers 0-9 as geometric shapes with angle counts. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows stylized digits arranged in 3x3 grid plus header circle. Top center shows white circle labeled '0 Angle' representing zero. Upper left text in red italics: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS', upper right in blue italics: 'PRIME NUMBERS'. Grid shows numbers 1-9, each designed with straight line segments forming angles marked in different colors. Number 1 (upper left): Red vertical line with single angle marked, labeled '1 Angle'. Number 2 (upper center): Blue angular shape resembling '2' with two marked angles, labeled '2 Angles'. Number 3 (upper right): Blue curved/angular '3' with three angles marked, labeled '3 Angles'. Number 4 (middle left): White angular '4' with four angles marked, labeled '4 Angles'. Number 5 (middle center): Red angular '5' shape with blue overlapping triangular structure showing five angles marked, labeled '5 Angles'. Number 6 (middle right): White angular design with six angles marked, labeled '6 Angles'. Number 7 (lower left): Blue angular '7' with seven angles marked, labeled '7 Angles'. Number 8 (lower center): Red symmetrical design composed of two triangles forming hourglass/double pyramid with eight angles marked, labeled '8 Angles'. Number 9 (lower right): White spiral/angular '9' design with nine angles marked, labeled '9 Angles'. Blue diagonal lines connect certain numbers suggesting relationships. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...) where each number sum of previous two. Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom text on beige border: 'NUMBERS AND GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES'. Diagram attempts to show mathematical patterns in number shapes, suggesting hidden geometry in numerical symbols. Concept related to sacred geometry and numerology popular in alternative cosmology communities. However, Arabic numeral shapes (0-9) are arbitrary cultural inventions - different writing systems use different symbols. Angle counting depends entirely on how digits are drawn9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-285","title":"Other 285","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734022_464930290373377_7244195183032635053_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-284","title":"Other 284","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12733513_463978993801840_1494230350043442241_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-286","title":"Other 286","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734152_464902100376196_1665637751964474831_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
