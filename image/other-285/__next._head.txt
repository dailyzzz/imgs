5:T851,DIY Hubble Space Telescope satirical assembly instructions meme. Humorous infographic mocking Hubble Space Telescope construction with everyday household items. Top banner in bright cyan blue with yellow handwritten-style text 'DO IT YOURSELF' and large white bold text 'HUBBLE TELESCOPE!' Below shows six panels with white backgrounds separated by black borders, each containing simple 3D rendered illustration of common object with label underneath. Panel 1: Washing machine drum - metallic cylindrical drum with perforated holes, labeled '1. Washing Machine Drum'. Panel 2: Aluminum foil - roll of shiny silver foil partially unrolled, labeled '2. Aluminum Foil'. Panel 3: Toilet seat lid - white oval plastic toilet seat cover, labeled '3. Toilet Seat Lid'. Panel 4: TV dish antenna - gray satellite dish on stand, labeled '4. T.V. Dish Antenna'. Panel 5: Curved lens - gray convex optical lens shown in profile, labeled '5. Curved Lens'. Panel 6: Solar panels - black rectangular photovoltaic panel array, labeled '6. Solar Panels'. Lower portion shows black background with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white at upper right. Center displays photograph of actual Hubble Space Telescope in orbit - cylindrical spacecraft with distinctive solar panel wings, metallic gold-brown thermal insulation wrapping, various instruments and antennae protruding. Large white handwritten text 'Voila!' suggests final assembled product. Bottom shows red banner 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical meme suggests Hubble telescope crudely assembled from cheap household items rather than sophisticated optical instrument. Implies space telescope imagery is fake, produced by low-budget contraption. However, Hubble launched 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery, built over decade by thousands of engineers at cost of $4.7 billion (inflation-adjusted ~$10B today). Contains 2.4-meter precision mirror, advanced spectrographs, infrared/ultraviolet cameras, operates in low Earth orbit at 547 km altitude. Has captured over 1.5 million observations transforming astronomy. Meme dismisses extraordinary engineering achievement as fraudulent apparatus0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 285 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"DIY Hubble Space Telescope satirical assembly instructions meme.
