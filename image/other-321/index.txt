13:Tb2d,Inception movie meme about ships disappearing below horizon questioning Earth curvature. Three-panel meme using Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy from 2010 film Inception in conversation format. Top panel shows close-up of Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb in black suit with white dress shirt and dark tie, styled brown hair, sitting at table. He leans toward conversation partner with serious expression. Warm golden-brown lighting suggests upscale restaurant or bar interior. Blurred lights visible in background. Text overlay in large bold white letters with black outline: 'SO HALF THE SHIP IS UNDER THE CURVE..CAN YOU SEE THE CURVE?' Middle panel shows Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer in dark gray suit with white shirt and patterned tie, brown hair. He sits across from DiCaprio with contemplative expression, looking slightly confused or skeptical. Similar warm lighting and background. Text overlay in large bold white letters: 'NO'. Bottom panel returns to DiCaprio - same shot as top panel showing him continuing conversation with knowing, leading expression as if making rhetorical point. No additional text. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme uses Inception's dream-within-dream concept metaphorically - questioning reality and what can be perceived. Format presents flat Earth argument about ships disappearing over horizon: if half ship hidden below curve, shouldn't curve itself be visible? Suggests that since curve isn't visible even when ships disappear, this proves inconsistency in globe model. However, this misunderstands geometry and scale. When ship disappears hull-first over horizon, it's because curved water surface between observer and ship blocks lower portion from view - not because ship went 'under' a visible arc. Horizon distance from 6-foot observer is only ~3 miles. At this scale, Earth's curvature (radius 3,959 miles) creates gentle arc too subtle to see as pronounced curve from ground level. Ship disappears because light path to lower hull is blocked by intervening curved surface, not because it sailed under visible arc. To observer, horizon appears straight line, but it's actually circle of equal distance around them on sphere's surface. Geometric horizon calculation shows exactly how much of ship becomes hidden at various distances based on Earth's radius. Phenomenon proves curvature exists even though curve itself isn't dramatically visible from sea level. Similar to how ant on basketball wouldn't see pronounced curve but objects would still disappear over basketball's horizon. Film Inception about questioning perceived reality makes ironic meme format since flat Earth belief requires rejecting observable reality (ships disappearing, satellite communications, circumnavigation, time zones, different stars at different latitudes) in favor of model contradicting these observations14:Tb5e,NASA technical document excerpt highlighting 'flat nonrotating earth' phrase taken out of context. Scanned page from NASA technical report showing mathematical equations and text with selective highlighting to suggest NASA admits Earth is flat. Top section displays complex mathematical matrices and equations - linearized system matrices labeled C22 showing partial derivatives, trigonometric functions (cos, sin), and variables. Second matrix shows C inverse (C^-1) written as partitioned matrix with subpartitions. Technical aerospace/flight dynamics mathematics involving coordinate transformations and reference frames. Middle section titled '3 CONCLUDING REMARKS' in bold serif font. Body text reads: 'This report derives and defines a set of linearized system matrices for a rigid aircraft of constant mass, flying in a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth.' Phrase 'a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth' highlighted in yellow. Text continues: 'Both generalized and standard linear system equations are derived from nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom equations of motion and a large collection of nonlinear observation (measurement) equations.' Next paragraph states: 'This derivation of a linear model is general and makes no assumptions on either the reference (nominal) trajectory about which the model is linearized or the symmetry of the vehicle mass and aerodynamic properties.' Phrase 'makes no assumptions' outlined in red box. Bottom shows document attribution: 'Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Facility, National Aeronautics and Space Administration' highlighted in yellow, followed by 'Edwards, California, January 8, 1987'. Lower right corner shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community frequently cites this document as NASA 'admission' that Earth is flat. However, this completely misrepresents technical document purpose. Report describes mathematical model for aircraft flight simulation - linearized equations simplify complex flight dynamics calculations. Assuming 'flat nonrotating earth' is standard simplification for local flight modeling over short distances/durations where Earth's curvature and rotation have negligible effect on aircraft behavior. Similar to how architects assume flat ground when designing buildings - valid approximation at local scale even though Earth is spherical. Document explicitly states model makes no assumptions about reference trajectory - meaning flat Earth assumption is just convenient mathematical simplification for computational efficiency, not claim about actual Earth shape. NASA has thousands of documents, photos, and missions definitively showing spherical Earth. Taking phrase out of context from technical simulation paper demonstrates confirmation bias - seizing on specific words while ignoring document's actual purpose and NASA's overwhelming evidence for spherical Earth15:Tc27,Ocean sunset photograph arguing against spherical Earth based on personal observation. Beautiful seascape photograph during golden hour with flat Earth claims overlaid. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'I SEE NO CURVATURE, I FEEL NO SPINNING EARTH BENEATH MY FEET'. Upper portion shows dramatic sunset sky - layers of clouds in shades of deep orange, burnt sienna, golden yellow, and dark gray-brown. Sun appears as bright yellow-white disc sitting on horizon surrounded by brilliant orange glow. Clouds create horizontal striations across sky with darker cloud bottoms contrasting against illuminated edges. Sky shows gradient from warmer tones near horizon to cooler blues above (though mostly cropped). Light breaks through cloud gaps creating atmospheric rays (crepuscular rays). Middle section displays ocean surface - calm water reflects sunset colors creating mirror effect. Golden-orange reflection of sun creates vertical column of light on water surface. Water appears mostly dark brown-orange in foreground transitioning to brighter orange-gold near horizon where sun's reflection is most intense. Small ripples and waves visible on surface but overall appears relatively calm. Horizon line perfectly straight extending horizontally across frame dividing sky from ocean. No visible land masses or objects - just open ocean. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'I FEEL THE WARMTH OF THE SUN CLOSE , NOT 93 MILLION MILES AWAY'. Lower portion shows 'Flat Earth Matters' branding. Image represents common flat Earth argument based on personal sensory experience: 1) Can't see curvature from ground level therefore Earth is flat, 2) Don't feel Earth spinning at 1,000 mph therefore it's stationary, 3) Sun feels warm therefore must be close, not 93 million miles away. However, these observations actually consistent with spherical Earth: 1) Curvature imperceptible at sea level due to planet's massive size - only becomes visible from high altitude (50,000+ feet shows obvious curve), 2) Don't feel rotation because atmosphere rotates with Earth, everything moves together (inertial reference frame), similar to not feeling airplane's 500 mph speed, 3) Sun's warmth results from electromagnetic radiation traveling through vacuum - distance doesn't prevent heat transfer via radiation. At 93 million miles, sun still delivers ~1,361 watts per square meter to Earth's surface. Inverse square law explains how star that massive and hot can warm Earth from that distance. Photograph itself ironically shows evidence of spherical Earth - sunset occurs because Earth's rotation carries observer away from sun. On flat Earth with local sun circling above, sun would shrink into distance rather than setting below horizon. Ships disappearing hull-first over ocean horizon proves water surface curves. Human perception evolved for human-scale environments, not intuiting planetary physics or astronomical distances. Science extends beyond direct sensory experience through measurement, mathematics, and instruments9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-321","title":"Other 321","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791115_469733219893084_8124318853532990989_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-320","title":"Other 320","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791096_469429403256799_5841742650296640406_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-322","title":"Other 322","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792123_472436566289416_7654048677470120033_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
