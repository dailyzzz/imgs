5:Ta9e,NASA underwater training pool mockup comparison suggesting space missions are filmed underwater. Two-panel photograph comparing NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory training with space missions, implying footage is faked. Top banner in large bold white letters on black background: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Left panel shows underwater training scene - astronauts in white spacesuits submerged in massive pool with scuba divers assisting. Two astronauts in full EVA suits (Extravehicular Mobility Units) working on mockup of spacecraft or ISS module visible as white/silver structure. Multiple scuba divers in wetsuits with green tanks visible around astronauts providing safety support and assistance. Blue-green water tinting entire scene. Equipment and structures visible underwater including white cylindrical modules, yellow handrails, metallic components. Lighting shows underwater environment with surface visible above. Right panel shows water recovery training - astronauts in bright orange launch/entry suits sitting in yellow inflatable life raft alongside mockup of Orion crew capsule. Capsule shows gray-white exterior with 'NASA' logo visible. Three astronauts in orange suits with helmets, one waving. Navy diver in wetsuit visible in water beside raft. Scene takes place in large indoor pool facility - visible industrial ceiling with lights, white walls, equipment around pool edges. Water appears bright blue. Recovery training simulates ocean splashdown procedures. Between panels shows NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circle with red chevron, white stars, 'NASA' text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'NATIONAL AQUATICS & SPACE ACTORS'. Wordplay changes 'Aeronautics' to 'Aquatics' suggesting space missions filmed in water tanks rather than actual space. Meme implies NASA uses underwater training facilities to fake space footage. However, Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) in Houston is legitimate astronaut training facility - 40-foot-deep pool containing 6.2 million gallons used to simulate microgravity for EVA practice before actual spacewalks. Underwater training allows astronauts to experience similar weightlessness sensation and practice procedures with full-scale mockups. Trainees wear weighted suits to achieve neutral buoyancy. Safety divers prevent accidents. This is TRAINING, not filming fake space missions. Actual ISS footage shows genuine microgravity behavior - water forming perfect spheres, objects floating without buoyancy effects, hair standing straight up, all impossible to replicate underwater. Bubbles would rise in water but don't appear in space footage. Lighting, shadows, movement physics clearly different between underwater training and orbital footage0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 314 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"NASA underwater training pool mockup comparison suggesting space missions are filmed underwater.
