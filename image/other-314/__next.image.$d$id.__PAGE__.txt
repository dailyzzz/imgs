3:Ta9e,NASA underwater training pool mockup comparison suggesting space missions are filmed underwater. Two-panel photograph comparing NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory training with space missions, implying footage is faked. Top banner in large bold white letters on black background: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Left panel shows underwater training scene - astronauts in white spacesuits submerged in massive pool with scuba divers assisting. Two astronauts in full EVA suits (Extravehicular Mobility Units) working on mockup of spacecraft or ISS module visible as white/silver structure. Multiple scuba divers in wetsuits with green tanks visible around astronauts providing safety support and assistance. Blue-green water tinting entire scene. Equipment and structures visible underwater including white cylindrical modules, yellow handrails, metallic components. Lighting shows underwater environment with surface visible above. Right panel shows water recovery training - astronauts in bright orange launch/entry suits sitting in yellow inflatable life raft alongside mockup of Orion crew capsule. Capsule shows gray-white exterior with 'NASA' logo visible. Three astronauts in orange suits with helmets, one waving. Navy diver in wetsuit visible in water beside raft. Scene takes place in large indoor pool facility - visible industrial ceiling with lights, white walls, equipment around pool edges. Water appears bright blue. Recovery training simulates ocean splashdown procedures. Between panels shows NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circle with red chevron, white stars, 'NASA' text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'NATIONAL AQUATICS & SPACE ACTORS'. Wordplay changes 'Aeronautics' to 'Aquatics' suggesting space missions filmed in water tanks rather than actual space. Meme implies NASA uses underwater training facilities to fake space footage. However, Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) in Houston is legitimate astronaut training facility - 40-foot-deep pool containing 6.2 million gallons used to simulate microgravity for EVA practice before actual spacewalks. Underwater training allows astronauts to experience similar weightlessness sensation and practice procedures with full-scale mockups. Trainees wear weighted suits to achieve neutral buoyancy. Safety divers prevent accidents. This is TRAINING, not filming fake space missions. Actual ISS footage shows genuine microgravity behavior - water forming perfect spheres, objects floating without buoyancy effects, hair standing straight up, all impossible to replicate underwater. Bubbles would rise in water but don't appear in space footage. Lighting, shadows, movement physics clearly different between underwater training and orbital footage4:Ta34,One Does Not Simply Boromir meme about water sticking to spinning ball Earth. Popular internet meme format using Sean Bean as Boromir from Lord of the Rings. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER DOES NOT SIMPLY'. Image shows close-up of actor Sean Bean in character as Boromir from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has shoulder-length brown hair with some strands across face, beard stubble, weathered appearance. Wears medieval-style clothing with leather/fabric armor visible at collar. Expression shows characteristic condescending, skeptical look associated with this meme format - slightly smirking, knowing gaze, hand raised near face in contemplative gesture making circle with thumb and forefinger (OK gesture or pinching motion). Background shows warm golden-orange blurred tones suggesting firelight or torch-lit indoor setting from film. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'STICK TO A BALL SPINNING 1000 MPH'. Meme format originates from Boromir's famous line 'One does not simply walk into Mordor' - template used to express that complex tasks aren't as simple as stated. In this context, suggests water adhering to spinning spherical Earth isn't simple physics. Argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph (equatorial rotation speed), centrifugal force should fling water off surface. However, this misunderstands scale and forces involved. Earth's circumference at equator is ~24,901 miles, rotating once per 24 hours = ~1,037 mph surface speed. But rotation is smooth and constant - no acceleration felt. Centrifugal acceleration at equator only ~0.034 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s² - nearly 300 times weaker. Gravity easily overcomes tiny centrifugal effect. Water 'sticks' because gravity pulls it toward Earth's center with far greater force than outward centrifugal effect. Similar to how water in bucket doesn't fly out when bucket spun at constant speed on rope - it's pressed against bottom by centripetal force exceeding gravity. Objects only fly off if angular velocity exceeds escape velocity, which would require Earth rotating once every ~84 minutes instead of 24 hours. We don't feel 1,000 mph motion because atmosphere, oceans, everything rotates together - no relative motion. Similar to airplane passengers not feeling 500 mph flight speed. Meme format effective because Boromir's condescending expression implies obvious impossibility, but physics actually supports water adhering to spinning sphere given forces involved5:Tafd,Apollo moon landing versus film studio set comparison suggesting moon missions were faked. Two-panel comparison photograph implying moon landings were filmed on Earth rather than lunar surface. Left panel shows iconic Apollo moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit standing on lunar surface beside Lunar Module descent stage. Astronaut salutes American flag planted in gray lunar soil. Flag appears to wave despite no atmosphere. Golden-foil wrapped LM visible with ladder, landing legs, various equipment. Surface shows gray regolith (moon dust/rock), bootprints visible. Harsh shadows suggest single light source (sun). Black sky with no visible stars. Scene lit with high contrast typical of lunar photography. Right panel shows film studio or production stage - large indoor facility with high ceilings, industrial lighting rigs visible overhead. Set dressed to resemble lunar surface with gray artificial terrain/sand. Full-scale mockup of Lunar Module visible - gold foil wrapped descent stage identical to real LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit (or costume) standing on set. American flag planted in fake regolith. Large green screen visible in background for chroma key compositing. Studio floor, lighting equipment, scaffolding, crew/equipment visible around edges showing clearly artificial environment. Multiple overhead lights creating studio lighting setup. Bottom text spans both panels in large bold white letters on black background: 'YOU CAN FOOL ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME IF YOUR EFFECTS BUDGET IS LARGE ENOUGH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Quote plays on Abraham Lincoln's famous saying 'You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.' Meme argues moon landings were elaborate hoax using Hollywood special effects. Right panel shows genuine film set or museum exhibit recreating moon landing for educational/entertainment purposes - common for documentaries, movies, museums to build replicas. However, comparing training mockup or film recreation to actual moon landing photos doesn't prove hoax. Apollo missions produced 8,400+ photos, 7 hours of video, 842 pounds of lunar samples (returned by 6 different missions), retroreflectors still used today for laser ranging experiments, testimony from 400,000+ NASA employees/contractors, independent verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary who tracked missions), ongoing satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible, and technological impossibility of faking continuous live TV broadcasts with 1960s effects technology. Studio photo shows what WOULD be needed to fake it - but such sets used for training, education, or recreation of historical events, not original footage0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-314","title":"Other 314","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771875_468121000054306_18914866914824211_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-313","title":"Other 313","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771861_466967416836331_6935803660984393691_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-315","title":"Other 315","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771936_469135936619479_7813187085681480870_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
