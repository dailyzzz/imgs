13:T4a7,Meme about educational indoctrination featuring young student in vintage classroom setting. Shows boy with dark curly hair wearing white collared shirt with dark trim, resting face on hand with bored or skeptical expression while sitting at wooden school desk. Behind him visible green chalkboard with mathematical equations or writing in chalk. Aged photograph quality with muted bluish-gray tones gives nostalgic 1960s-70s classroom atmosphere. Top banner in gray reads 'THEY LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING' in white text. Bottom section shows red banner with white text quote: 'Illiteracy in the 21st century will not be about reading and writing, but about those who cannot unlearn what they were led to believe.' Attribution watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana' at bottom left. Argues modern education system indoctrinates rather than educates, specifically regarding globe Earth model. Suggests true literacy/intelligence requires ability to question and unlearn false information taught in schools. Uses disengaged student image to represent those trapped in educational programming. Quote emphasizes critical thinking and willingness to reject mainstream narratives as markers of genuine education9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-124","title":"Other 124","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12307440_439888942877512_731251387358927024_o.jpg","description":"Dramatic seascape photograph with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text overlay in large bold white letters across lower third.

Top illustration shows curved line representing Earth's curvature with points labeled 'B' on left and 'A' on right. Curved arc between them labeled '5 miles' showing height of arc. Straight line distance across top of arc labeled '6 miles'. Diagram includes small structures at points B and A (possibly buildings or observation points) labeled with 'C' above. Bottom illustration shows flat horizontal line between same points B and A with straight '6 miles' distance labeled, representing flat Earth model. Visual demonstrates geometric difference: on curved surface, straight-line distance (6 miles) differs from arc length, while on flat surface they would be same. Illustrates how curvature should create measurable difference in distances if Earth is spherical versus flat"}}]
