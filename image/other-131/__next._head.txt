5:T41b,Satirical composite image showing 'Earthrise' from moon with Disney theme. Bottom half shows gray lunar surface with craters and rough terrain in black and white, mimicking famous Apollo moon photographs. Upper half shows black space. Rising above lunar horizon is light blue children's inflatable globe ball decorated with Disney characters - Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy positioned around globe with playful poses. Globe shows simplified world map with 'WALT DISNEY WORLD' text visible. Bottom right shows NASA logo altered with red slash and 'LIARS' text. Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical image mocking NASA's Apollo Earthrise photographs by replacing majestic Earth with cheap Disney toy globe, suggesting NASA's space imagery is as authentic as children's cartoon globes. Implies moon landings were staged theatrical productions, comparing NASA to Disney entertainment company. Uses Mickey Mouse iconography to suggest space program is fantasy/fiction for children rather than legitimate science0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 131 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Satirical composite image showing 'Earthrise' from moon with Disney theme.
