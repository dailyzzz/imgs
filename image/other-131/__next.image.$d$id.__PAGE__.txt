3:T41b,Satirical composite image showing 'Earthrise' from moon with Disney theme. Bottom half shows gray lunar surface with craters and rough terrain in black and white, mimicking famous Apollo moon photographs. Upper half shows black space. Rising above lunar horizon is light blue children's inflatable globe ball decorated with Disney characters - Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy positioned around globe with playful poses. Globe shows simplified world map with 'WALT DISNEY WORLD' text visible. Bottom right shows NASA logo altered with red slash and 'LIARS' text. Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical image mocking NASA's Apollo Earthrise photographs by replacing majestic Earth with cheap Disney toy globe, suggesting NASA's space imagery is as authentic as children's cartoon globes. Implies moon landings were staged theatrical productions, comparing NASA to Disney entertainment company. Uses Mickey Mouse iconography to suggest space program is fantasy/fiction for children rather than legitimate science4:T409,Meme criticizing popular science communicators Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye. Shows split image with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson on left wearing dark suit with yellow tie, gesturing with hands while speaking, with blurred colorful bokeh background. Right side shows Bill Nye in brown/tan jacket holding microphone with serious expression. Top text in bold white letters: 'YOU MIGHT BE A SHEEPLE IF...' Bottom text states 'YOU BELIEVE A FAILED ACTOR AND FAILED COMEDIAN ARE SCIENTISTS.' Bottom left watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Attacks credibility of mainstream science popularizers by dismissing their scientific credentials and reducing them to entertainment backgrounds. References Bill Nye's background as comedian/TV personality and Neil deGrasse Tyson's media presence. Uses 'sheeple' (sheep + people) insult suggesting those who trust these figures are blindly following authority without critical thinking. Implies mainstream science education is entertainment propaganda rather than legitimate scientific discourse0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-131","title":"Other 131","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321694_487124251487314_3168701071416758240_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-130","title":"Other 130","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12321512_479749088891497_152611109440113677_n.jpg","description":"Parody of iconic NASA logo on black background. Shows circular blue sphere (representing Earth or space) with white orbital ring/swoosh and white stars scattered across surface. Instead of 'NASA' text, large white letters spell 'LIARS' in NASA's signature font style. Red vector/chevron swoosh crosses diagonally through circle matching NASA logo design. Top text in light blue reads 'RESEARCH FLAT EARTH' in clean sans-serif font. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text with 'fb.com/fematters' social media handle below. Perfect mimicry of NASA's logo design language but replacing agency name with accusation of dishonesty. Implies space agency deliberately deceives public about Earth's shape and nature of space. Encourages independent research into flat Earth theory. Visual rhetoric uses authority and recognition of NASA branding to undermine that same authority by calling them liars"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-132","title":"Other 132","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12322609_508175386048867_1537640828806982945_o.jpg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
