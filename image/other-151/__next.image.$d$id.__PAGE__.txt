3:T527,Artistic cross-section sculpture demonstrating water's properties with text overlay. Shows gray neutral background. Sculpture appears to be concrete or stone cut away to reveal transparent turquoise/teal resin or glass representing water inside. Gray concrete/stone forms irregular container with curved bottom surface and architectural features like arched opening/window. Transparent blue-green material fills container showing water conforming to shape with realistic surface tension - small ripples and waves visible at top surface suggesting movement. Vertical striations in transparent material create realistic water texture. Small cylindrical brown object (possibly lighthouse or post) protrudes from top of structure. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER TAKES THE SHAPE OF ITS RECEPTACLE AND FINDS ITS LEVEL'. Bottom text: 'AND IT FLOWS OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO BOUNDARIES KEEPING IT IN'. Right side watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Demonstrates fundamental properties of water - conforming to container shape and seeking level surface. Argues if Earth were spinning sphere, water would need container/force to hold it on curved surface. Suggests oceans remaining on Earth without flowing off edges implies Earth is flat plane with boundaries (ice wall/Antarctica) rather than borderless sphere4:T41f,Dr. Evil meme from Austin Powers questioning NASA budget allocation. Shows Mike Myers as Dr. Evil character wearing iconic light blue-gray suit with high collar, bald head. Character holds pinky finger to corner of mouth in signature gesture with satisfied smirk expression. Blurred gray-blue background suggests lair/headquarters setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016'. Bottom text: '19.3 BILLION DOLLARS...' with ellipsis suggesting suspicion about fund usage. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme uses Dr. Evil's character (comedic villain known for exaggerated ransom demands and evil schemes) to suggest NASA's budget is excessive or fraudulently obtained. Implies massive government funding goes toward maintaining space exploration deception rather than genuine science. Question mark hanging over dollar amount suggests money is being misused or embezzled. Uses comedy villain to make NASA seem cartoonishly evil rather than legitimate scientific organization0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-151","title":"Other 151","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440787_503315173201555_6202945621858404569_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist absurdist humor meme with white/light gray background. Shows large bold outlined text in three lines. Top line in huge letters: 'UNBELIEVABLE!' Second line in large gray outlined text: 'MY KITCHEN TABLE'. Third line: 'IS A SPHERE!' Bottom portion shows curved edge of dark brown wooden table surface suggesting round/spherical shape. Middle of image shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark in white text. Sarcastic meme using reductio ad absurdum argument. Mocks mainstream science by applying sphere logic to everyday flat objects. Argues that just as obviously flat kitchen table would be absurd to call spherical, so too is calling Earth a sphere when it appears flat to human observation. Uses simple household object analogy to make globe Earth seem ridiculous. Employs exaggerated disbelief ('UNBELIEVABLE!') to suggest claiming sphericity for observably flat objects is preposterous. Implies direct sensory experience (table is flat) should override scientific models (Earth is sphere)"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-150","title":"Other 150","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12440597_481006972099042_1879922258013738237_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-152","title":"Other 152","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12466283_454476978085375_7688683053710238504_o.jpg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
