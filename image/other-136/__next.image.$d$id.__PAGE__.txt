3:T422,Museum or gallery photograph showing three people as silhouettes viewing large framed azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map on white wall. Polished beige tile floor reflects figures and lighting. Left figure (man in dark jacket) and right figure (person in dark clothing) stand at distance. Center figure (woman with long dark hair wearing red/burgundy jacket and dark pants) stands directly in front of map. Large white-framed map dominates wall showing flat Earth projection with North Pole at center. Map titled 'EVO ANTAKAN STORIE OF YN DID' (partially visible) with two smaller globe diagrams in upper corners. Main circular map shows continents in colors - blue oceans, yellow/green landmasses (Africa prominent on right, Americas center-left, Asia/Australia). Grid lines radiate from center. Map appears to be historical cartographic artifact. Attribution '©Ashlee Webster' at bottom center. Image captures people contemplating alternative Earth model in formal exhibition setting, suggesting flat Earth cosmology gaining mainstream cultural attention4:T490,Flat Earth cosmology diagram illustrating sea water currents and sun's circular path. Title at top: 'Sea water currents & The path of the sun above the flat earth'. Shows azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center. Continents shown in yellow-green (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. White arrows indicate circular current patterns: 'SOUTH PACIFIC GYRE' on left, 'NORTH PACIFIC GYRE' visible, 'SOUTH ATLANTIC' labeled, 'INDIAN OCEAN GYRE' on right. Sun's path shown as concentric circles: outer yellow circle labeled 'Tropic of Cancer' at top, inner red circle labeled 'NORTH/SOUTH' showing sun's movement, yellow 'Equator' line crosses center, bottom circle labeled 'Tropic of Capricorn'. Small white moon illustration upper right. Bottom text explains: 'The electromagnetic energy from the sun causes the different directions in the currents of Northern Hemi'plane vs Southern Hemi'plane'. Attribution: '©Ashlee Webster'. Website: 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Diagram argues ocean gyres and currents make more sense on flat plane with circling sun than on rotating sphere5:T4b7,Historical 'Gleason's New Standard Map of the World' from 1892, famous azimuthal equidistant projection often cited in flat Earth discussions. Top header reads 'GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD' with subtitle 'ON THE PROJECTION OF J. S. CHRISTOPHER MODERN COLLEGE OF "IT IS" BLACKHEATH, ENGLAND.' Left side shows 'LONGITUDE AND TIME CALCULATOR' panel. Right side shows 'PATENT ALLOWED November 1892' with listing of countries (England, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Chili). Large circular map with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink (Europe, parts of Asia), yellow (Asia, Australia), green (Africa, South America), with blue oceans. Outer ring in bright red marked with Roman numerals I through XII representing time zones. Bottom shows two smaller circular diagrams labeled 'JUNE SOLSTICE' (left) and 'DECEMBER SOLSTICE' (right) illustrating sun's path. Map includes latitude/longitude grid lines. Bottom text: 'PUBLISHED BY THE BUFFALO ELECTROTYPE AND ENGRAVING CO. BUFFALO N.Y., U.S.A.' This map projection is scientifically accurate for aviation/navigation but used by flat Earth proponents as evidence of true Earth shape0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-136","title":"Other 136","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12347581_440712966128443_1534322738022711994_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-135","title":"Other 135","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12342667_441088416090898_7257479148511891092_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-137","title":"Other 137","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12369049_442894235910316_33832006102216282_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
