Ocean horizon visible in background with calm blue water and light cloudy sky. Top text reads 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND.' Middle text states 'AND WATER ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL.' Bottom text asks 'SO WTF IS CURVING?' with red text credit 'SHADOW THUNDERCLOUD'. Person appears to be partially submerged up to waist/chest level in water. Presents logical argument: if water naturally seeks level (demonstrable physical property), and Earth is 71% water, then Earth's surface should be predominantly flat/level rather than curved. Questions how majority-water planet can have curved surface when water's fundamental property is to maintain level horizontal surface. Uses ocean backdrop to emphasize vast quantities of supposedly level water covering Earth"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-9","title":"Water Level 9","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18402805_125962337965790_3495852714320985349_n.jpeg","description":"Simple logic meme with gradient blue background showing ocean scene. Top two-thirds displays white text in equation format: 'WATER DOESN'T CURVE + EARTH IS 70% WATER = EARTH IS FLAT' using large bold letters with black outlines. Bottom third shows photograph of deep blue ocean with small white sailboat on horizon line under light blue sky with white clouds. Photo credit 'Nick Havok' in bottom left corner. Presents syllogistic argument: if water demonstrably doesn't curve (as observable in containers, lakes, oceans), and Earth's surface is 70% water, then Earth must be flat rather than spherical. Uses mathematical equation format to present logical deduction from two premises to conclusion. Combines observable property of water (always seeks level) with Earth's composition to conclude planet must be flat plane. Sailboat photograph emphasizes flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, supporting visual claim of non-curved water surface extending to distance"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-11","title":"Water Level 11","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18447588_125962204632470_7584539329049491921_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme showing identical ocean scenes with different labels. Both panels display same photograph of deep blue ocean with small two-masted sailboat on horizon under light blue sky with scattered white clouds. Top panel labeled 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in black text. Bottom panel labeled 'NOT SEA CURVE' in black text. Images appear identical, emphasizing point that ocean surface appears perfectly flat and level at horizon, not curved. Simple visual argument that terminology 'sea level' accurately describes observable reality (flat/level water surface), while 'sea curve' would be inaccurate description since no visible curvature can be observed. Uses wordplay to highlight that even mainstream terminology acknowledges water's levelness. Sailboat provides scale reference showing distant horizon appears as straight flat line where ocean meets sky, with no visible drop or curvature despite distance"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
