5:T80a,Flat Earth cosmology diagram showing 24-hour sun cycle with Fibonacci and prime number symbolism. Artistic educational diagram titled at top: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE' on beige/tan border. Central image shows dome Earth model with firmament enclosed circular plane. Earth disc displays continents in green against blue oceans, surrounded by dark blue/black dome or barrier. Ice ring/Antarctica forms outer edge. Above Earth floats sun symbol - yellow/cream circle with radiating triangular rays representing light. Small circle below sun indicates moon or another celestial body. Around central Earth arranged circular pattern of numbers 1-24 representing 24-hour clock/day cycle. Numbers positioned in clockwise arrangement: top has 13, 14, 15 (daylight hours), continuing around through 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 (nighttime hours) on dark blue section, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 completing circle. Dashed curved line segments between numbers suggest sun's circular path around Earth center. Numbers have dual significance indicated by legend at bottom: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS' (left side, white dot) and 'PRIME NUMBERS' (right side, white dot with circle). Some numbers marked with circled symbols indicating both properties. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...) where each number is sum of previous two, appears in nature (spirals, growth patterns). Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom subtitle: 'THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN'. Aesthetic combines vintage scientific illustration style with modern flat Earth cosmology. Suggests mathematical/mystical significance to 24-hour solar cycle in flat Earth model. Sun circles above stationary plane creating day/night cycle through proximity. Dark blue section represents night side where sun is distant. Diagram implies intelligent design through mathematical patterns embedded in timekeeping and celestial mechanics. Beige border and serif font give antique authority appearance, mimicking historical astronomical charts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"THE 24 HOURS & THE SUN | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth cosmology diagram showing 24-hour sun cycle with Fibonacci and prime number symbolism.
