3:Tb5e,NASA technical document excerpt highlighting 'flat nonrotating earth' phrase taken out of context. Scanned page from NASA technical report showing mathematical equations and text with selective highlighting to suggest NASA admits Earth is flat. Top section displays complex mathematical matrices and equations - linearized system matrices labeled C22 showing partial derivatives, trigonometric functions (cos, sin), and variables. Second matrix shows C inverse (C^-1) written as partitioned matrix with subpartitions. Technical aerospace/flight dynamics mathematics involving coordinate transformations and reference frames. Middle section titled '3 CONCLUDING REMARKS' in bold serif font. Body text reads: 'This report derives and defines a set of linearized system matrices for a rigid aircraft of constant mass, flying in a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth.' Phrase 'a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth' highlighted in yellow. Text continues: 'Both generalized and standard linear system equations are derived from nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom equations of motion and a large collection of nonlinear observation (measurement) equations.' Next paragraph states: 'This derivation of a linear model is general and makes no assumptions on either the reference (nominal) trajectory about which the model is linearized or the symmetry of the vehicle mass and aerodynamic properties.' Phrase 'makes no assumptions' outlined in red box. Bottom shows document attribution: 'Ames Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Facility, National Aeronautics and Space Administration' highlighted in yellow, followed by 'Edwards, California, January 8, 1987'. Lower right corner shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community frequently cites this document as NASA 'admission' that Earth is flat. However, this completely misrepresents technical document purpose. Report describes mathematical model for aircraft flight simulation - linearized equations simplify complex flight dynamics calculations. Assuming 'flat nonrotating earth' is standard simplification for local flight modeling over short distances/durations where Earth's curvature and rotation have negligible effect on aircraft behavior. Similar to how architects assume flat ground when designing buildings - valid approximation at local scale even though Earth is spherical. Document explicitly states model makes no assumptions about reference trajectory - meaning flat Earth assumption is just convenient mathematical simplification for computational efficiency, not claim about actual Earth shape. NASA has thousands of documents, photos, and missions definitively showing spherical Earth. Taking phrase out of context from technical simulation paper demonstrates confirmation bias - seizing on specific words while ignoring document's actual purpose and NASA's overwhelming evidence for spherical Earth4:Tafc,Curved reflections comparison questioning why ocean reflections aren't distorted if Earth is curved. Three-panel photographic comparison questioning reflection distortion on curved versus flat surfaces. Top left shows Chicago Cloud Gate sculpture (The Bean) - famous public art installation in Millennium Park. Highly polished stainless steel elliptical sculpture with mirror-like surface reflecting surrounding cityscape. Sculpture's curved surface creates dramatic distorted reflections of buildings, sky, people. Visible reflections show Chicago skyscrapers stretched and warped across Bean's convex surface. Person standing beneath arch for scale. Urban plaza visible with stone pavement. Top right shows same Bean sculpture photographed from ground level looking up at underside - convex mirrored surface shows heavily distorted reflections of photographer, buildings, environment. Reflections stretched and curved following Bean's elliptical geometry. Gray pavement visible. Middle text overlay on black bar in white sans-serif font: 'IF THE OCEANS ARE CURVED, WHY DOESN'T ANYONE OBSERVE DISTORTED REFLECTIONS?' Bottom panel shows serene ocean scene with perfect mirror-like reflection. Calm water surface appearing absolutely flat and smooth like glass. Sky above filled with white fluffy cumulus clouds against medium blue background. Water below shows nearly perfect reflection of clouds - white cloud shapes mirrored in blue water creating symmetrical composition. Small wooden boat/canoe visible floating on water in foreground center, also reflected perfectly. Horizon line divides image horizontally. Water appears completely undistorted acting as perfect mirror. Lower left shows 'fb.com/aterraeplana' attribution. Meme argues if Earth's oceans are curved, reflections should be distorted like reflections on Bean's curved surface. Since ocean reflections appear undistorted, water must be flat. However, this misunderstands scale and geometry. Bean sculpture has tight curvature radius of ~10 meters - observer standing nearby sees dramatic curve across entire visible surface. Earth's radius is 6,371 km (6,371,000 meters) - curvature so gentle that local area appears flat. Ocean surface curves following Earth's sphere, but over distances of meters/kilometers curve is imperceptible. Water acts as locally flat mirror while globally curving. Reflections depend on angle of incidence - on calm water, light reflects at consistent angles creating clear mirror images regardless of large-scale curvature. Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon proves water does curve - can't see across large distances because curved water surface blocks view. Bean distortions result from tight compound curves visible within arm's reach, not comparable to gentle planetary curvature invisible at human scale5:Tb2d,Inception movie meme about ships disappearing below horizon questioning Earth curvature. Three-panel meme using Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy from 2010 film Inception in conversation format. Top panel shows close-up of Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb in black suit with white dress shirt and dark tie, styled brown hair, sitting at table. He leans toward conversation partner with serious expression. Warm golden-brown lighting suggests upscale restaurant or bar interior. Blurred lights visible in background. Text overlay in large bold white letters with black outline: 'SO HALF THE SHIP IS UNDER THE CURVE..CAN YOU SEE THE CURVE?' Middle panel shows Cillian Murphy as Robert Fischer in dark gray suit with white shirt and patterned tie, brown hair. He sits across from DiCaprio with contemplative expression, looking slightly confused or skeptical. Similar warm lighting and background. Text overlay in large bold white letters: 'NO'. Bottom panel returns to DiCaprio - same shot as top panel showing him continuing conversation with knowing, leading expression as if making rhetorical point. No additional text. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Meme uses Inception's dream-within-dream concept metaphorically - questioning reality and what can be perceived. Format presents flat Earth argument about ships disappearing over horizon: if half ship hidden below curve, shouldn't curve itself be visible? Suggests that since curve isn't visible even when ships disappear, this proves inconsistency in globe model. However, this misunderstands geometry and scale. When ship disappears hull-first over horizon, it's because curved water surface between observer and ship blocks lower portion from view - not because ship went 'under' a visible arc. Horizon distance from 6-foot observer is only ~3 miles. At this scale, Earth's curvature (radius 3,959 miles) creates gentle arc too subtle to see as pronounced curve from ground level. Ship disappears because light path to lower hull is blocked by intervening curved surface, not because it sailed under visible arc. To observer, horizon appears straight line, but it's actually circle of equal distance around them on sphere's surface. Geometric horizon calculation shows exactly how much of ship becomes hidden at various distances based on Earth's radius. Phenomenon proves curvature exists even though curve itself isn't dramatically visible from sea level. Similar to how ant on basketball wouldn't see pronounced curve but objects would still disappear over basketball's horizon. Film Inception about questioning perceived reality makes ironic meme format since flat Earth belief requires rejecting observable reality (ships disappearing, satellite communications, circumnavigation, time zones, different stars at different latitudes) in favor of model contradicting these observations0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-320","title":"Other 320","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791096_469429403256799_5841742650296640406_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-319","title":"Other 319","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791057_469314683268271_6337968302255732564_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-321","title":"Other 321","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12791115_469733219893084_8124318853532990989_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
