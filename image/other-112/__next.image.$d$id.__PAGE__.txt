3:T8fa,Historical newspaper article from Hawera & Normanby Star, Volume LX, 19 September 1910, Page 2, titled 'THE FLAT EARTH'. Green header banner at top. Article discusses flat Earth arguments in response to polar expeditions and Antarctic exploration. Text reads: 'There are still some earnest folk who believe that the world is not and stationary and that the sun moves around it, two unimpeachable understandings while men sleep. An Englishman who holds this peculiar view has published a circular pointing out the "fallacy" of polar expeditions in search of Poles which, according to his theory, cannot possibly have any existence. "The Antartics were supplied with my charts held in the ship Discovery and Admiral Nimrod," he writes, "and were advised to save all the expense of a polar expedition as an impossibility. But they would go, and the public are put to a great expense in consequence; and the whole youth of England meets upon the Continent are being studiously uneducated." The author asserts that latitude 90 degrees may be "anywhere on the outer circumference of the earth" and does not mean a Pole of any kind whatever. "Who does the Antarctic Furnishes," he adds eliminatingly, "is an advance to the apex of the sun, and this apex of the sun appears to be the Magnetic Pole! The two points appear to coincide with, however, this difference, that the apex of the sun is liable to a few minutes every year! Thus the sun is early or late at twelve mid-day accordingly!" It would be circular proceeds to discuss the position of New Zealand. "It it seems, is in doubt. A person who goes to the 'Dominion knows he has arrived there, but he does not know his relative position with regard to Africa or America; unless he is of the track [improbable], the author. "The Anglo-Saxon-British fleet proved the position of New Zealand to be northeast of the globe will be flat also, by sailing north from Cape Horn to San Francisco and then on to New Zealand, in much the same straight direction, and not as per globe or instructor chart. Argyll's-immense icebergs, ten miles long, and which are met near Cape Horn, can come from the outside circumference only, and can come from a narrow limiting South Pole." The circular is enclosed with an offer to supply additional copies of a trade chart.4:T504,Stunning sunset beach scene with philosophical text about water retention on spinning Earth. Shows spectacular twilight sky with layered clouds in shades of blue, pink, orange, and golden yellow creating dramatic atmospheric display. Silhouettes of approximately 20 people riding camels in single file across wet beach sand, perfectly reflected in shallow water below creating mirror symmetry. Ocean horizon visible in background with gentle waves. Sky shows complex cloud formations with light streaming through gaps. Top white text reads: 'If the Earth were a globe, rolling and dashing through "space" at the rate of "a hundred miles in five seconds of time."' Bottom white text states: 'the waters of seas and oceans could not, by any known law, be kept on its surface - the assertion that they could be retained under these circumstances being an outrage upon human understanding and credulity!' Bottom right watermark 'JM'. Argues that Earth's supposed high rotational velocity (derived from 1000 mph equatorial speed) would make water retention physically impossible on curved spinning surface. Questions how gravity could hold oceans against such extreme centrifugal forces. Uses serene beach reflection scene ironically to emphasize water's observable stillness and levelness0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-112","title":"Other 112","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10374919_450542705145469_3844065068484983493_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-111","title":"Other 111","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10341689_475055729360833_4093670835672127601_n.jpg","description":"Twilight Zone meme featuring Rod Serling in classic black and white portrait photograph.
