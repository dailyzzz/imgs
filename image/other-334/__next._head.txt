5:Tea5,ISS hoax meme claiming International Space Station footage filmed using green screen technology. Image shows astronaut in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuit against gradient background transitioning from white/light blue at top to darker blue-green at bottom. Astronaut positioned in three-quarter profile view showing right side of suit and helmet. White spacesuit highly detailed with realistic textures - fabric layers, mechanical joints, equipment pouches, hoses, connectors, straps visible across torso and arms. Large spherical helmet with clear polycarbonate visor shows astronaut's face - appears to be middle-aged person with serious expression looking off to side. Interior helmet lighting visible illuminating face. Gold-tinted sun visor in raised position above clear visor. Helmet attached to Hard Upper Torso (HUT) unit with metal neck ring connector. Right shoulder displays prominent American flag patch - rectangular flag with red, white, and blue stripes and stars. Chest area shows various equipment including caution/warning labels, attachment points for safety tethers. Left side shows NASA logo patch - classic blue circular "meatball" design with red chevron, white text, and orbital trajectory. Suit appears to be EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) used for spacewalks. Background intentionally simple gradient suggesting studio environment rather than space. Text overlay in large bold blue letters at top left: "NASA ISS HOAX AstroNOT" (deliberately misspelling astronaut as "astroNOT" to mock authenticity). Bottom text in blue: "#YearBehindGreenScreen" hashtag suggesting ongoing deception. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Lower right shows modified NASA logo - classic meatball design with red diagonal slash through it overlaid with word "LIARS" in blue/white gradient letters, explicitly accusing space agency of deception. Meme represents flat Earth belief that International Space Station is elaborate hoax, with "astronauts" actually performing in Earth-based studio using green screen technology to fake weightlessness and space environment. Claims suggest ISS livestreams showing Earth views, experiments, and crew activities are CGI composites or underwater filming with green screen backgrounds added in post-production. Argument points to occasional technical glitches in livestreams (bubbles, harness reflections, hair not floating properly) as "proof" of deception. However, extensive evidence confirms ISS reality: 1) Station visible to naked eye as bright moving point of light crossing sky in ~90-minute orbit, observable worldwide, 2) Amateur astronomers photograph ISS transiting sun/moon showing detailed station structure matching official images, 3) Radio operators communicate with ISS crew using ham radio, 4) Multiple nations operate on ISS (USA, Russia, EU, Japan, Canada) - Cold War adversaries would not collaborate on hoax, 5) Continuous crew rotation since 2000 involving 270+ astronauts from 20+ countries, 6) Scientific research conducted on station produces peer-reviewed results, 7) Supply missions from multiple commercial and governmental entities regularly dock with station (SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Russian Progress, Japanese HTV), 8) ISS cost over $150 billion to construct and operate - unsustainable for hoax. Green screen claims ignore that ISS footage shows consistent physics of microgravity: neutral buoyancy underwater training looks distinctly different from actual weightlessness (air bubbles rise, movements are slower/different, buoyancy compensators visible). Meme format designed to plant doubt about space exploration authenticity, targeting NASA specifically as primary US space agency responsible for ISS operations and public communications.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 334 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"ISS hoax meme claiming International Space Station footage filmed using green screen technology.
