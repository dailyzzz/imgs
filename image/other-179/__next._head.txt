5:T52a,Two-panel cartoon of laughing globe Earth character reading flat Earth news. Left panel: anthropomorphized blue globe Earth with grid lines (latitude/longitude), white continents visible. Earth character has cartoon face with eyes, big grinning smile showing teeth, extended red tongue laughing. Blue arms hold newspaper titled 'DAILY NEWS' with headline: 'Yes There Are Still People Who Believe Earth Is Flat.' Globe tilted back laughing with motion lines showing shaking. Bottom right 'JM' logo on shirt/body. Right panel: Same globe character now shocked/horrified expression - wide open mouth screaming, bulging eyes, sweat drops flying off. Holds different newspaper titled 'BREAKING NEWS!' with headline 'For scientists to break off some EVIDENCE call us at NO!' Motion lines show violent shaking/trembling. Bottom right 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Satirical comic suggests mainstream/globe believers initially laugh at flat Earth but panic when asked for proof. Left panel represents confident ridicule of flat Earth believers. Right panel shows existential crisis when challenged to provide evidence for globe model. Argues those who mock flat Earth cannot defend their own beliefs when questioned. Implies cognitive dissonance when globe believers realize they accepted Earth's shape on faith without evidence0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 179 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel cartoon of laughing globe Earth character reading flat Earth news.
