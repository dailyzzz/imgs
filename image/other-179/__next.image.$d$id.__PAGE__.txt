3:T52a,Two-panel cartoon of laughing globe Earth character reading flat Earth news. Left panel: anthropomorphized blue globe Earth with grid lines (latitude/longitude), white continents visible. Earth character has cartoon face with eyes, big grinning smile showing teeth, extended red tongue laughing. Blue arms hold newspaper titled 'DAILY NEWS' with headline: 'Yes There Are Still People Who Believe Earth Is Flat.' Globe tilted back laughing with motion lines showing shaking. Bottom right 'JM' logo on shirt/body. Right panel: Same globe character now shocked/horrified expression - wide open mouth screaming, bulging eyes, sweat drops flying off. Holds different newspaper titled 'BREAKING NEWS!' with headline 'For scientists to break off some EVIDENCE call us at NO!' Motion lines show violent shaking/trembling. Bottom right 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Satirical comic suggests mainstream/globe believers initially laugh at flat Earth but panic when asked for proof. Left panel represents confident ridicule of flat Earth believers. Right panel shows existential crisis when challenged to provide evidence for globe model. Argues those who mock flat Earth cannot defend their own beliefs when questioned. Implies cognitive dissonance when globe believers realize they accepted Earth's shape on faith without evidence4:T497,Office Space meme mocking pear-shaped Earth explanation. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) in iconic scene from 1999 comedy. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, red suspenders, yellow tie with animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug, has condescending smirk expression. Blurred office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, beige walls. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'IF NASA COULD SHOW ME THAT PEAR SHAPED OBLATE SPHEROID'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'TrueEarthFlatEarth'. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate speak ('that would be great') to mock NASA's pear-shaped Earth claims. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is oblate spheroid (slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator) which he described as 'pear-shaped' causing controversy. Flat Earth proponents seized on this as admission Earth photos don't match actual shape, demanding to see actual pear-shaped Earth. Meme's sarcastic tone suggests NASA cannot produce such image because it doesn't exist. Uses office comedy context to portray NASA as incompetent bureaucracy making excuses5:T4fa,Salar de Uyuni salt flats perfect mirror with curvature question. Shows spectacular photograph of Bolivia's salt flats during rainy season. Thin layer of water creates flawless mirror reflection making sky and ground indistinguishable. Upper half shows dramatic cloudscape - brilliant blue sky with massive white and gray cumulus clouds scattered across. Darker storm clouds visible on left. Lower half shows perfect mirror reflection of entire sky scene in still water. Lone silhouetted figure walks across middle of frame, body and reflection creating symmetrical composition. Person appears to walk between two identical skies. Horizon line where actual sky meets reflection is nearly invisible. Salt flat extends in all directions appearing completely flat and level. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHERE DOES THE CURVE START?' Bottom right watermark 'thetrutherfactory'. Uses one of nature's most perfect mirror surfaces to question Earth's curvature. Argues if Earth curves, the perfectly flat mirror reflection extending for miles shouldn't be possible. Questions at what distance curvature should become visible. Salar de Uyuni spans 10,582 square kilometers - flat Earth proponents argue this vast flat surface contradicts spherical Earth model0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-179","title":"Other 179","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12513554_460155257517547_5025456840721782473_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-178","title":"Other 178","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512672_483382441861495_7999342294974040002_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-180","title":"Other 180","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12514038_454174674782272_4416362959406589445_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
