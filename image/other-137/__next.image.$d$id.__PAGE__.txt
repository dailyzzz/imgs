3:T4b7,Historical 'Gleason's New Standard Map of the World' from 1892, famous azimuthal equidistant projection often cited in flat Earth discussions. Top header reads 'GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD' with subtitle 'ON THE PROJECTION OF J. S. CHRISTOPHER MODERN COLLEGE OF "IT IS" BLACKHEATH, ENGLAND.' Left side shows 'LONGITUDE AND TIME CALCULATOR' panel. Right side shows 'PATENT ALLOWED November 1892' with listing of countries (England, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Chili). Large circular map with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink (Europe, parts of Asia), yellow (Asia, Australia), green (Africa, South America), with blue oceans. Outer ring in bright red marked with Roman numerals I through XII representing time zones. Bottom shows two smaller circular diagrams labeled 'JUNE SOLSTICE' (left) and 'DECEMBER SOLSTICE' (right) illustrating sun's path. Map includes latitude/longitude grid lines. Bottom text: 'PUBLISHED BY THE BUFFALO ELECTROTYPE AND ENGRAVING CO. BUFFALO N.Y., U.S.A.' This map projection is scientifically accurate for aviation/navigation but used by flat Earth proponents as evidence of true Earth shape4:T422,Museum or gallery photograph showing three people as silhouettes viewing large framed azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map on white wall. Polished beige tile floor reflects figures and lighting. Left figure (man in dark jacket) and right figure (person in dark clothing) stand at distance. Center figure (woman with long dark hair wearing red/burgundy jacket and dark pants) stands directly in front of map. Large white-framed map dominates wall showing flat Earth projection with North Pole at center. Map titled 'EVO ANTAKAN STORIE OF YN DID' (partially visible) with two smaller globe diagrams in upper corners. Main circular map shows continents in colors - blue oceans, yellow/green landmasses (Africa prominent on right, Americas center-left, Asia/Australia). Grid lines radiate from center. Map appears to be historical cartographic artifact. Attribution '©Ashlee Webster' at bottom center. Image captures people contemplating alternative Earth model in formal exhibition setting, suggesting flat Earth cosmology gaining mainstream cultural attention0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-137","title":"Other 137","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12369049_442894235910316_33832006102216282_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-136","title":"Other 136","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12347581_440712966128443_1534322738022711994_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-138","title":"Other 138","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12375116_446583322208074_4764068951087523623_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist photograph of Antarctic ice landscape with bold text overlay. Shows vast expanse of white snow and ice extending to horizon under clear blue sky transitioning from deep blue at top to lighter blue near horizon. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations and ridges creating texture across snowy terrain. Harsh sunlight creates shadows emphasizing ice formations. Horizon line appears straight and level where ice meets sky. Large bold white text in center reads 'ANTARCTICA IS FLAT' in impact font with black outline. Simple direct message using photographic evidence of Antarctic terrain appearing flat to naked eye. Argues ground-level view of Antarctica shows no curvature, supporting flat Earth model. Image emphasizes observable flatness of ice shelf/landscape despite Antarctica's position on spherical Earth's bottom in mainstream model. Uses stark minimalist composition to make bold declarative statement about continent's topography"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
