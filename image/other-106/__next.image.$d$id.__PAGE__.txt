3:T43a,Two-panel demonstration about centrifugal force with water in rotating container. Top header states 'Water in a rotating container forms a parabolic shape (due to the centrifugal force).' Left panel shows clear rectangular aquarium with bright blue water sitting level on black rotating platform (lazy Susan) in classroom/lab setting with beige walls and doorway visible. Water surface perfectly flat and horizontal. Right panel shows same setup during rotation with hands visible holding edges, water surface now curved upward forming parabolic/concave shape due to centrifugal force pushing water outward against container walls. Text 'Flat Earth Matters' visible on right panel. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Large text asks 'WHERE'S THIS CENTRIPETAL FORCE?' Questions why oceans don't form parabolic shape if Earth rotates. Demonstrates that rotating containers create observable water curvature via centrifugal force, yet Earth's oceans remain level, suggesting Earth doesn't rotate. Challenges rotating Earth model by comparing to demonstrable physics of spinning water4:T409,Two-panel comparison meme contrasting complexity of 'proof' for globe vs flat Earth. Top panel labeled 'PROOF OF THE GLOBE' in yellow text shows black background filled with complex mathematical equations, formulas, graphs, and diagrams in white and colored chalk. Includes calculus notations, trigonometric functions, coordinate systems, geometric diagrams with sine/cosine waves, algebraic expressions like 'y = ax² + bx + c', physics formulas. Shows curved Earth image at bottom with blue oceans and white clouds against black space. Symbolizes abstract mathematical models used to support spherical Earth. Bottom panel labeled 'PROOF OF THE PLANE' shows simple photograph of actual flat landscape - vast agricultural plains with green fields extending to horizon under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Contrasts complex theoretical mathematics (globe proof) with simple observable reality (flat proof), suggesting direct observation of flat horizon is more valid than mathematical abstractions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-106","title":"Other 106","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10298652_468825159983890_1649980769427830451_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-105","title":"Other 105","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10268717_474792612720478_2806422081768567871_n.jpg","description":"Azimuthal equidistant projection map visualization showing global flight path network. Circular map centered on North Pole with π (pi) symbol in center. Concentric rings mark hours (//1, //2, etc. up to //9) radiating outward. Blue represents oceans, green/tan/orange represents continents. Thousands of white lines crisscross map showing flight paths or connections between locations, creating dense web pattern concentrated in Northern Hemisphere with fewer connections to Southern Hemisphere. Heavy concentration of routes between North America, Europe, and Asia. Bottom credit '©Ashlee Filopard Webster'. Azimuthal equidistant projection preserves distances from center point, making it useful for aviation and radio communication but creates distortions at edges. In flat Earth discourse, this projection is sometimes presented as actual Earth map showing true flight paths, though it's mathematical projection of spherical Earth onto flat surface"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-107","title":"Other 107","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10299547_476196915913381_2028930688826370881_n.jpg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
