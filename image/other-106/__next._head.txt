5:T43a,Two-panel demonstration about centrifugal force with water in rotating container. Top header states 'Water in a rotating container forms a parabolic shape (due to the centrifugal force).' Left panel shows clear rectangular aquarium with bright blue water sitting level on black rotating platform (lazy Susan) in classroom/lab setting with beige walls and doorway visible. Water surface perfectly flat and horizontal. Right panel shows same setup during rotation with hands visible holding edges, water surface now curved upward forming parabolic/concave shape due to centrifugal force pushing water outward against container walls. Text 'Flat Earth Matters' visible on right panel. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Large text asks 'WHERE'S THIS CENTRIPETAL FORCE?' Questions why oceans don't form parabolic shape if Earth rotates. Demonstrates that rotating containers create observable water curvature via centrifugal force, yet Earth's oceans remain level, suggesting Earth doesn't rotate. Challenges rotating Earth model by comparing to demonstrable physics of spinning water0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 106 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel demonstration about centrifugal force with water in rotating container.
