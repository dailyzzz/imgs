13:T4a1,Technical comparison diagram with white background showing size and altitude relationships between ISS, stratospheric balloons, and Earth features. Top shows International Space Station sketch (110m length) at 340km altitude marked as reference. Center shows two balloon systems: left is 'NASA ultralong duration balloon' (large light blue pumpkin-shaped balloon, 115m wide x 70m tall, volume 532,000 m³, record duration 54 days, capacity 3600kg, price $2-3 million, with parachute and payload box, operates at constant altitude resisting day-night temperature swings); right is 'World View Stratollite' (smaller teardrop balloon with solar panels, volume 22,000 m³, record duration 12 hours, capacity 50kg, price hundreds of thousands of dollars, uses solar energy to pump air and control density/altitude, can resist winds). Bottom diagram shows altitude layers: Mount Everest at ground level, Troposphere to 10km, Stratospheric winds layer to 55km, with both balloon flight paths shown navigating stratospheric winds. Demonstrates high-altitude balloon platforms operate at similar altitudes as claimed low-Earth orbit satellites, suggesting technological overlap or substitution.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"satellites-12","title":"Satellites 12","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45761066_2230561903642460_4172780136468316160_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison of satellite technology.
