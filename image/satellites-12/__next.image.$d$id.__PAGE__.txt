3:T4a1,Technical comparison diagram with white background showing size and altitude relationships between ISS, stratospheric balloons, and Earth features. Top shows International Space Station sketch (110m length) at 340km altitude marked as reference. Center shows two balloon systems: left is 'NASA ultralong duration balloon' (large light blue pumpkin-shaped balloon, 115m wide x 70m tall, volume 532,000 m³, record duration 54 days, capacity 3600kg, price $2-3 million, with parachute and payload box, operates at constant altitude resisting day-night temperature swings); right is 'World View Stratollite' (smaller teardrop balloon with solar panels, volume 22,000 m³, record duration 12 hours, capacity 50kg, price hundreds of thousands of dollars, uses solar energy to pump air and control density/altitude, can resist winds). Bottom diagram shows altitude layers: Mount Everest at ground level, Troposphere to 10km, Stratospheric winds layer to 55km, with both balloon flight paths shown navigating stratospheric winds. Demonstrates high-altitude balloon platforms operate at similar altitudes as claimed low-Earth orbit satellites, suggesting technological overlap or substitution.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"satellites-12","title":"Satellites 12","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45761066_2230561903642460_4172780136468316160_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison of satellite technology. Left panel shows workers in yellow and black safety vests on elevated platform working on white satellite equipment labeled 'WORLD VIEW' with American flag and red dot pattern visible at sunset/dusk. Right panel shows black and white aerial/satellite photograph of approximately 13-15 large circular structures (possibly storage tanks or satellite ground equipment) arranged in cluster pattern over rural farmland with roads and field boundaries visible. Suggests satellite ground infrastructure or alternative high-altitude platform technology (World View stratospheric balloon system) rather than orbital satellites. World View Enterprises operates high-altitude balloon platforms for observation, potentially presented as evidence that 'satellites' are actually ground or stratospheric-based systems."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-11","title":"Satellites 11","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45676866_304170243758762_4600803026565857280_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison showing astronaut on spacewalk. Top panel shows astronaut in white spacesuit with gold-tinted visor working on equipment, visible blue water/pool background suggesting underwater training. Bottom panel shows same or similar scene with black space background instead of blue water. Both show astronaut with detailed spacesuit, helmet, life support equipment, and ISS/spacecraft components. White horizontal dividing line separates panels. Suggests spacewalk footage may be filmed underwater in Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory training pool rather than actual space, with background digitally altered from blue water to black space in post-production. Questions authenticity of space imagery by comparing training simulation to released footage."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-13","title":"Satellites 13","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/45931638_2230561946975789_1215864701301293056_n.jpeg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
