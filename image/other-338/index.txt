13:Tf9d,Humorous moon landing hoax parody showing photoshopped Tyrannosaurus Rex approaching Apollo Lunar Module. Satirical composite image mocking Apollo moon landings as Hollywood-style productions. Upper section shows NASA logo (blue circular "meatball" with red chevron, white "NASA" text, stars, orbital trajectory) in top left corner. Large blue text next to logo states "NEVER A STRAIGHT ANSWER" - alternative meaning for NASA acronym implying space agency is deceptive or evasive. Attribution "fb.com/fematters" below in white text. Black background surrounds upper text creating stark contrast. Main image below shows lunar surface scene that appears to be authentic Apollo mission photograph digitally altered with dinosaur. Gray lunar regolith covers surface showing typical moon features: fine dust/powder texture, small rocks scattered across terrain, gentle undulating hills in background, absolutely black sky above indicating airless environment. Lunar surface shows characteristic footprints and disturbances in dust. Center left displays Apollo Lunar Module (LM) in classic configuration - gold/bronze metallic foil covering descent stage, ladder visible on side, landing pads visible beneath, American flag not visible in this angle. LM photographed from side angle showing boxy geometric structure with various protrusions, antennas, thrusters. Module casts sharp shadow on surface consistent with single light source (sun) in vacuum environment. Right side shows photoshopped Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur in menacing pose approaching LM - massive theropod dinosaur standing on two legs, tiny front arms, enormous head with powerful jaws open showing teeth, thick tail extending behind for balance. T-Rex rendered in greenish-gray tones, scales/texture visible on skin, appears three-dimensional suggesting decent quality 3D model or previous special effects asset. Dinosaur casts shadow on lunar surface maintaining lighting consistency. Dinosaur positioned as if stalking or approaching LM creating absurdist humor. Foreground bottom shows silhouettes of two figures (presumably astronauts) in black shadow - one appears to be photographing scene, other standing observing. Shadows perfectly black with no detail visible, consistent with harsh sunlight contrast in lunar vacuum. Crosshairs (fiducial markers) visible at various points across image - these are registration marks actually present on Apollo Hasselblad camera film frames to aid photo analysis and measurements. Multiple crosshairs appear as thin cross marks at regular intervals. Entire composition parodies moon landing hoax theory through absurdist humor. Including obviously fake T-Rex alongside legitimate-looking LM image suggests moon landing photos could contain added elements/forgeries. Humor cuts both ways: 1) From hoax believer perspective: mockingly suggests NASA faked landings so poorly that metaphorical "dinosaurs" in footage go unnoticed by gullible public, 2) From skeptic perspective: obviously fake dinosaur highlights absurdity of moon hoax claims by showing how ridiculous conspiracy theories become. "NEVER A STRAIGHT ANSWER" phrase common in conspiracy communities, playing on NASA acronym to suggest agency stonewalls legitimate questions or provides evasive responses about space program. However, NASA actually provides extensive public documentation: thousands of photos, videos, technical documents, lunar samples, astronaut testimony, ongoing educational outreach. Image format is clearly satirical composite - T-Rex obviously anachronistic (dinosaurs extinct 66 million years ago, moon formed 4.5 billion years ago). Humor relies on absurdist juxtaposition of serious space exploration with fantastical element. Popular in both conspiracy communities (as mockery of official narrative) and skeptic communities (as mockery of conspiracy theories). Photoshop quality varies - dinosaur integration reasonably good with proper lighting/shadows, but obviously fake to anyone examining closely.14:Te2f,"Sheeple" meme showing sheep watching globe Earth on television, suggesting blind acceptance of mainstream narratives. Black and white photograph creating stark visual metaphor. Right side shows sheep's head in profile facing left toward television screen - wool appears textured and light-colored in monochrome, face shows typical ovine features with curved nose, visible eye, ears positioned back. Sheep positioned as attentive viewer, head tilted slightly toward screen suggesting focused attention. Left side displays vintage box television set (likely 1960s-1970s style) with rounded screen, antenna protruding from top, control knobs visible on side panel. TV sits on what appears to be barrel or cylindrical platform. Screen displays iconic "Blue Marble" photograph of Earth from space - full disk of Earth showing blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents visible, particularly recognizable landmass shapes. Earth image appears as bright glowing sphere against TV's dark background. Composition creates direct visual line between sheep and globe Earth image, suggesting sheep is receiving information/programming from television. Dark background isolates subjects creating dramatic lighting focused on sheep's illuminated face and glowing TV screen. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Image serves as visual metaphor employing term "sheeple" (portmanteau of "sheep" + "people") commonly used in conspiracy theory communities to describe general population who supposedly follow mainstream narratives without critical thinking or questioning. Message suggests: 1) People are like sheep - docile, herd-following animals who blindly accept what they're told, 2) Television/media acts as programming device feeding population false information, 3) Globe Earth model is lie perpetuated through media repetition rather than empirical truth, 4) Those who believe Earth is spherical do so because they've been "programmed" by television/education rather than personal investigation. Meme implies flat Earth believers have awakened from programming while masses remain asleep, accepting globe Earth because "TV said so." This rhetoric positions flat Earth belief as independent thinking versus mainstream "sheep-like" acceptance. However, argument is logically flawed: 1) Globe Earth predates television by millennia - ancient Greeks calculated Earth's circumference around 240 BCE, 2) Evidence for spherical Earth comes from direct observations available to anyone (ship hulls disappearing over horizon first, different star constellations in different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, etc.), not just media, 3) Dismissing opposing views as "programmed" is ad hominem fallacy avoiding engagement with actual evidence, 4) "Sheeple" accusation assumes disagreement stems from gullibility rather than evaluation of evidence. Ironically, flat Earth belief often spreads through social media echo chambers where believers reinforce each other's views without rigorous testing - exhibiting herd behavior the meme criticizes. Scientific consensus on spherical Earth based on thousands of years of accumulated observations, measurements, and experiments by independent researchers across all cultures and time periods, not television programming. Photograph's black-and-white aesthetic adds gravitas and artistic quality to message, making it more shareable and memorable in flat Earth communities. Format is concise visual argument requiring no complex explanation - immediately communicates idea that accepting globe Earth equals being mindless sheep.15:T10dc,Moon landing skepticism meme questioning Apollo spacecraft size transformations through mission stages. Three-panel composite image suggesting impossibility of massive Saturn V rocket transforming into tiny spacecraft components. Image presents visual "proof" that Apollo missions couldn't work due to spacecraft size discrepancies. Left panel shows Saturn V rocket on launch pad during liftoff - massive white cylindrical rocket standing vertically, approximately 363 feet tall, distinctive black and white checkered pattern visible on upper section, orange/yellow flames and white exhaust smoke billowing from base as five F-1 engines ignite. Launch platform/gantry visible at base. Blue sky background with scattered clouds. Ocean or water body visible in distance suggesting Kennedy Space Center location. Rocket appears enormous against landscape. Red arrow labeled "how did this" points from left panel toward top right. Text implies: "how did this massive structure..." Top right panel shows Apollo Lunar Module on moon surface - much smaller gold-foil wrapped spacecraft with angular geometric design, spindly landing legs extended, ladder visible on side, antenna projecting from top. Gray lunar regolith visible beneath and around LM. Black airless sky above. LM appears tiny compared to launch vehicle, perhaps 20-30 feet tall. Red arrow labeled "turn into this" points from Saturn V to LM, suggesting impossible transformation. Lower right panel shows Apollo Command Module after splashdown - conical spacecraft floating in ocean with three large red-orange parachutes still attached above. Module appears charred/burned with heat-shielding discoloration. Several personnel in orange suits visible in water around capsule, small inflatable raft nearby. Recovery ship visible in background. Command Module appears even smaller - perhaps 12 feet diameter cone. Red arrow labeled "then back to this" points from LM to CM capsule, completing visual argument suggesting impossible size transformations. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Meme's rhetorical strategy suggests logical impossibility: giant rocket somehow "shrinks" to small LM, then further "shrinks" to tiny capsule returning to Earth. This reveals fundamental misunderstanding of rocket staging and mission architecture. Scientific explanation: Saturn V was multi-stage rocket designed to achieve escape velocity (25,000+ mph) required to reach moon. Of 363-foot height, most was propellant and expendable stages discarded during ascent: 1st stage (S-IC) with five F-1 engines burned 2 minutes lifting rocket through atmosphere, then separated/fell to ocean; 2nd stage (S-II) with five J-2 engines burned 6 minutes reaching near-orbital velocity, then separated; 3rd stage (S-IVB) with one J-2 engine completed orbit and performed Trans-Lunar Injection burn sending spacecraft toward moon, then separated. What remained was Apollo spacecraft consisting of: Command Module (CM - crew cabin for 3 astronauts), Service Module (SM - propulsion, power, life support), and Lunar Module (LM - lunar lander). CM+SM+LM together were only ~60 feet long - rest of Saturn V was throwaway fuel tanks and engines. Only LM descended to moon surface (leaving CM+SM in lunar orbit with one astronaut). After moon landing, only LM ascent stage (upper portion) returned to lunar orbit where it docked with CM+SM. LM descent stage stayed on moon. LM ascent stage was then discarded. Only CM returned to Earth - SM separated just before reentry. So "transformation" was actually systematic discarding of components: Rocket stages → Apollo spacecraft → LM on moon → LM ascent stage → CM capsule. This is mass ratio principle: most of rocket is fuel to accelerate small payload. Mission used 6.5 million pounds fully fueled to return 12,000-pound CM to Earth. Meme's arrows suggest mysterious transformation rather than progressive jettisoning of expended components. This misunderstanding common among those unfamiliar with spaceflight principles. Every rocket works this way - SpaceX Falcon 9 is 230 feet tall but carries payloads of few tons. International Space Station modules launched in Space Shuttle cargo bay, itself launched on massive External Tank and SRBs. Image exploits visual intuition to create false contradiction where none exists.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-338","title":"Other 338","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801552_484859795047093_982613225372540816_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-337","title":"Other 337","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801418_469038806629192_3289755197121663397_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-339","title":"Other 339","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801604_471762246356848_1923248698791688320_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
