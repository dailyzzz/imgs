3:Ta34,One Does Not Simply Boromir meme about water sticking to spinning ball Earth. Popular internet meme format using Sean Bean as Boromir from Lord of the Rings. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER DOES NOT SIMPLY'. Image shows close-up of actor Sean Bean in character as Boromir from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has shoulder-length brown hair with some strands across face, beard stubble, weathered appearance. Wears medieval-style clothing with leather/fabric armor visible at collar. Expression shows characteristic condescending, skeptical look associated with this meme format - slightly smirking, knowing gaze, hand raised near face in contemplative gesture making circle with thumb and forefinger (OK gesture or pinching motion). Background shows warm golden-orange blurred tones suggesting firelight or torch-lit indoor setting from film. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'STICK TO A BALL SPINNING 1000 MPH'. Meme format originates from Boromir's famous line 'One does not simply walk into Mordor' - template used to express that complex tasks aren't as simple as stated. In this context, suggests water adhering to spinning spherical Earth isn't simple physics. Argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph (equatorial rotation speed), centrifugal force should fling water off surface. However, this misunderstands scale and forces involved. Earth's circumference at equator is ~24,901 miles, rotating once per 24 hours = ~1,037 mph surface speed. But rotation is smooth and constant - no acceleration felt. Centrifugal acceleration at equator only ~0.034 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s² - nearly 300 times weaker. Gravity easily overcomes tiny centrifugal effect. Water 'sticks' because gravity pulls it toward Earth's center with far greater force than outward centrifugal effect. Similar to how water in bucket doesn't fly out when bucket spun at constant speed on rope - it's pressed against bottom by centripetal force exceeding gravity. Objects only fly off if angular velocity exceeds escape velocity, which would require Earth rotating once every ~84 minutes instead of 24 hours. We don't feel 1,000 mph motion because atmosphere, oceans, everything rotates together - no relative motion. Similar to airplane passengers not feeling 500 mph flight speed. Meme format effective because Boromir's condescending expression implies obvious impossibility, but physics actually supports water adhering to spinning sphere given forces involved4:T8f1,AI-generated children studying flat Earth azimuthal equidistant projection map. Digital artwork showing diverse group of children examining flat Earth model in futuristic educational setting. Five children gathered around table studying illuminated flat Earth map displayed on tilted stand resembling decorative globe mount. Children appear ages 8-12, showing racial diversity - mix of skin tones from light to dark. All wear matching gray-blue uniforms with green glowing circuit-pattern designs on sleeves suggesting futuristic/sci-fi school setting. Girl on left with braided hair points at map with finger, appears engaged. Three children stand/lean over map from various angles. Girl on right with ponytail wearing green earrings observes. All show curious, focused expressions studying the map. Central focus: azimuthal equidistant projection map showing flat Earth disc with North Pole at center. Map displays blue oceans, yellow-green-brown continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia visible radiating from center), white ice around perimeter representing Antarctica. Map mounted on brass/golden colored gimbal-style stand with degree markings around outer ring, suggesting navigational instrument. Small spherical objects attached to mount possibly representing sun and moon. Map surface illuminated with glowing effect. Background shows institutional setting with teal-blue brick walls, yellow-green neon light strip on wall creating atmospheric lighting. Visible emblem or logo on wall (left) showing globe with orbital rings and text. Wooden table surface. Lower left shows 'DDees.com' signature indicating digital art origin. Image appears AI-generated based on slight uncanny valley characteristics, overly smooth skin textures, slightly imperfect anatomy, perfect uniformity of clothing, idealized futuristic aesthetic. Artwork presents flat Earth education in positive, progressive light - suggesting advanced future where children learn 'truth' about flat Earth. However, azimuthal equidistant projection shown is legitimate cartographic projection of spherical Earth (used by UN logo, aviation planning, radio communications) - represents mathematical transformation of 3D sphere onto 2D plane for specific purposes, not proof of flat Earth5:Ta9e,NASA underwater training pool mockup comparison suggesting space missions are filmed underwater. Two-panel photograph comparing NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory training with space missions, implying footage is faked. Top banner in large bold white letters on black background: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Left panel shows underwater training scene - astronauts in white spacesuits submerged in massive pool with scuba divers assisting. Two astronauts in full EVA suits (Extravehicular Mobility Units) working on mockup of spacecraft or ISS module visible as white/silver structure. Multiple scuba divers in wetsuits with green tanks visible around astronauts providing safety support and assistance. Blue-green water tinting entire scene. Equipment and structures visible underwater including white cylindrical modules, yellow handrails, metallic components. Lighting shows underwater environment with surface visible above. Right panel shows water recovery training - astronauts in bright orange launch/entry suits sitting in yellow inflatable life raft alongside mockup of Orion crew capsule. Capsule shows gray-white exterior with 'NASA' logo visible. Three astronauts in orange suits with helmets, one waving. Navy diver in wetsuit visible in water beside raft. Scene takes place in large indoor pool facility - visible industrial ceiling with lights, white walls, equipment around pool edges. Water appears bright blue. Recovery training simulates ocean splashdown procedures. Between panels shows NASA's classic 'meatball' logo - blue circle with red chevron, white stars, 'NASA' text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'NATIONAL AQUATICS & SPACE ACTORS'. Wordplay changes 'Aeronautics' to 'Aquatics' suggesting space missions filmed in water tanks rather than actual space. Meme implies NASA uses underwater training facilities to fake space footage. However, Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) in Houston is legitimate astronaut training facility - 40-foot-deep pool containing 6.2 million gallons used to simulate microgravity for EVA practice before actual spacewalks. Underwater training allows astronauts to experience similar weightlessness sensation and practice procedures with full-scale mockups. Trainees wear weighted suits to achieve neutral buoyancy. Safety divers prevent accidents. This is TRAINING, not filming fake space missions. Actual ISS footage shows genuine microgravity behavior - water forming perfect spheres, objects floating without buoyancy effects, hair standing straight up, all impossible to replicate underwater. Bubbles would rise in water but don't appear in space footage. Lighting, shadows, movement physics clearly different between underwater training and orbital footage0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-313","title":"Other 313","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771861_466967416836331_6935803660984393691_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-312","title":"Other 312","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771784_470962913103448_1071833718786072481_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-314","title":"Other 314","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771875_468121000054306_18914866914824211_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
