5:Ta34,One Does Not Simply Boromir meme about water sticking to spinning ball Earth. Popular internet meme format using Sean Bean as Boromir from Lord of the Rings. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER DOES NOT SIMPLY'. Image shows close-up of actor Sean Bean in character as Boromir from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has shoulder-length brown hair with some strands across face, beard stubble, weathered appearance. Wears medieval-style clothing with leather/fabric armor visible at collar. Expression shows characteristic condescending, skeptical look associated with this meme format - slightly smirking, knowing gaze, hand raised near face in contemplative gesture making circle with thumb and forefinger (OK gesture or pinching motion). Background shows warm golden-orange blurred tones suggesting firelight or torch-lit indoor setting from film. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'STICK TO A BALL SPINNING 1000 MPH'. Meme format originates from Boromir's famous line 'One does not simply walk into Mordor' - template used to express that complex tasks aren't as simple as stated. In this context, suggests water adhering to spinning spherical Earth isn't simple physics. Argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph (equatorial rotation speed), centrifugal force should fling water off surface. However, this misunderstands scale and forces involved. Earth's circumference at equator is ~24,901 miles, rotating once per 24 hours = ~1,037 mph surface speed. But rotation is smooth and constant - no acceleration felt. Centrifugal acceleration at equator only ~0.034 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s² - nearly 300 times weaker. Gravity easily overcomes tiny centrifugal effect. Water 'sticks' because gravity pulls it toward Earth's center with far greater force than outward centrifugal effect. Similar to how water in bucket doesn't fly out when bucket spun at constant speed on rope - it's pressed against bottom by centripetal force exceeding gravity. Objects only fly off if angular velocity exceeds escape velocity, which would require Earth rotating once every ~84 minutes instead of 24 hours. We don't feel 1,000 mph motion because atmosphere, oceans, everything rotates together - no relative motion. Similar to airplane passengers not feeling 500 mph flight speed. Meme format effective because Boromir's condescending expression implies obvious impossibility, but physics actually supports water adhering to spinning sphere given forces involved0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 313 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"One Does Not Simply Boromir meme about water sticking to spinning ball Earth.
