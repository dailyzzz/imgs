13:T83f,Australian surfer riding gravitational wave meme playing on upside-down Australia trope. Meme combining gravitational wave physics concept with flat Earth southern hemisphere joke. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'AUSTRALIAN MAN SURFS'. Image shows spectacular action surfing photograph taken from above showing surfer carving turn on large ocean wave. Surfer wears red wetsuit or rashguard with white/tan surfboard visible beneath feet. Wave shows beautiful turquoise-blue water with white foam spray arcing dramatically from surfer's turn creating crescent-shaped curtain of water. Surrounding ocean displays deep blue color with rippled texture. Photograph captures dynamic moment mid-maneuver showing skill and power. Foam and spray create artistic patterns in water. Lighting suggests sunny conditions with clear visibility. Perspective from directly above or slightly elevated gives bird's-eye view of surfing action. Bottom text: 'GRAVITATIONAL WAVE'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme works on multiple levels: 1) References 2016 gravitational waves detection making science news, 2) Plays on 'upside-down Australia' joke where people in southern hemisphere are allegedly upside down on globe Earth, 3) Visual pun where curved arc of water spray resembles wave/waveform in physics sense. Flat Earth context: In flat Earth model, 'down' is same direction everywhere (toward disc), so Australia isn't upside down. Globe skeptics mock idea that Australians stand upside down (misunderstanding of gravity - 'down' means toward Earth's center from any surface point). Gravitational waves reference adds physics joke since flat Earth community rejects Einstein's relativity and gravitational wave detection. Meme suggests Australian's orientation on globe requires gravitational waves to stay attached. However, gravity pulls toward planetary center regardless of surface location - no special force needed. On sphere, all surface dwellers experience 'down' as toward core. Australian surfer experiences same gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²) as surfer anywhere else14:T849,Flat Earth cosmology electromagnetic spectrum diagram with sun and moon frequencies. Educational diagram showing visible light spectrum in context of flat Earth model. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY'. Main section on black background divided into vertical colored bands representing rainbow spectrum from red to violet. Top row shows seven circles representing celestial bodies: Six labeled 'SUN' in gradually changing yellow-cream tones corresponding to color below, plus one labeled 'MOON' in white/pale yellow over purple band. Below circles, white section labeled 'FREQUENCY INTERVAL' lists specific frequencies: 480 THz (terahertz), 510 THz, 540 THz, 610 THz, 670 THz, 750 THz reading left to right under respective colors. Middle shows white waveform illustrations overlaid on spectrum demonstrating increasing frequency - waves become more compressed (shorter wavelength) moving left to right. Arrows indicate 'INCREASING ENERGY' pointing right and 'INCREASING WAVELENGTH' pointing left. Bottom dark section labeled 'WAVELENGTH INTERVAL' shows corresponding wavelengths: 635 nm (nanometers), 590 nm, 560 nm, 490 nm, 450 nm, 400 nm. Color bands progress: deep red/maroon (left), brown/orange, olive/yellow-green, bright green, cyan/turquoise, blue, deep blue/purple, violet (right). Lower beige border shows 'SPECTRUM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION'. Diagram attempts to connect sun's light to specific frequencies and wavelengths in flat Earth model, suggesting sun emits light at different frequencies that we perceive as colors. Also includes moon in spectrum implying moon generates its own light. However, scientifically: Sun emits broad continuous spectrum (blackbody radiation ~5778K) containing all visible wavelengths simultaneously, not discrete frequencies. Moon doesn't generate light - reflects sunlight. Listed frequencies/wavelengths are correct for visible spectrum (red ~700nm/430THz to violet ~400nm/750THz), but diagram misrepresents how sun and moon relate to spectrum. Real sun emits across entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays, with peak in visible range15:T84c,Morgan Freeman meme about circular reasoning and scientific authority. Popular internet meme format using actor Morgan Freeman to mock appeal to authority logical fallacy. Image shows Freeman wearing white suit jacket, white dress shirt, white tie against blurred gray-white background. He has gray hair and beard, warm friendly expression with slight smile. Both hands raised palms-up in explanatory gesture suggesting he's presenting obvious information. Background appears to be bright indoor setting possibly interview or photo shoot. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT'. Bottom text: 'PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING WHEN YOU CLAIM SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED IT'. Meme highlights circular reasoning and blind trust in scientific authority. Format plays on Freeman's authoritative voice and persona - frequently narrates documentaries giving him association with explaining facts. His calm presentation style makes absurd statements sound credible. In flat Earth context, meme criticizes mainstream acceptance of globe Earth based purely on trusting scientific consensus rather than personal investigation. Suggests people blindly believe scientific claims without examining evidence themselves. However, this creates ironic contradiction - meme itself asks people to distrust scientific method while trusting conspiracy theorists' alternative explanations. Scientific consensus on spherical Earth isn't blind faith - it's based on centuries of reproducible observations, measurements, calculations anyone can verify: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, seasons, Foucault pendulum, satellite communications requiring spherical trigonometry, circumnavigation, photographs from space. Science encourages skepticism and verification through repeatable experiments. Flat Earth claims often invoke authority of Bible, ancient texts, or charismatic YouTubers - different authority but still authority. Meme format became popular for satirizing various forms of circular reasoning and unquestioning belief9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-276","title":"Other 276","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717831_463501427182930_424940914684462304_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-275","title":"Other 275","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717757_464902123709527_7235288575083781581_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-277","title":"Other 277","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12728913_463456750520731_470438632903024065_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
