Top text reads 'WHEN YOU FINALLY MEET' and bottom text reads 'A FLAT EARTHER IN REAL LIFE'. Depicts joy and excitement of flat Earth believers encountering each other in person, suggesting rarity of such meetings. Both men appear elated with expressive body language, one gesturing enthusiastically toward the other.

Top panel shows real photograph of white SUV crashed into leaning utility pole on rural road beside green crop field under overcast sky. Utility pole tilted at extreme angle after impact. Bottom panel shows colorful desktop globe with blue oceans and multi-colored continents, with push-pin or thumbtack stuck at angle into globe surface, mimicking the leaning pole from top image. Visual joke suggests globe with angled pin resembles crashed car with leaning pole, creating humorous parallel between everyday accident scene and globe Earth model.

Blue-uniformed cheerleader in center with back to camera, hair in motion. Two labeled groups: left side shows 'GLOBE LOVER' (man in suit looking disinterested), right side shows 'FLAT EARTH PROOFS' (appears as cheerleader's label). Humorous comparison suggesting flat Earth proofs are as attractive and attention-grabbing as cheerleader performing, while globe believers sit unmoved and unimpressed.
