Shows mirror-image pair of astronauts in white spacesuits with reflective helmet visors positioned symmetrically against Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Africa, Europe, and Middle East with clouds and oceans. Background features colorful nebula with blue and orange cosmic clouds. Astronauts hold arms forward creating illusion they're reaching toward or framing Earth. Bottom text in white letters: 'NASA in HEBREW means TO DECEIVE'. Claims Hebrew etymology of NASA acronym implies deceptive intent, though actual claim is disputed linguistic interpretation. Visual suggests astronauts and space photography are part of elaborate hoax.

Top-left panel shows black and white aerial photograph of massive circular open-pit mine with terraced rings descending into Earth, captioned 'Deepest hole dug in Earth is 8 miles'. Top-right panel shows two scuba divers underwater in blue water with sunlight filtering from above, captioned 'We've only explored 5% of Earth's oceans'. Bottom panel shows Voyager space probe with large dish antenna and gold record against starry background, with Captain Picard from Star Trek face-palming in corner, captioned 'Yet... NASA claims we have Voyager 1 and 2 Space Probes billions of miles away'. Suggests contradiction: if humanity has barely explored Earth's depths and oceans, claims of spacecraft billions of miles away seem implausible.

Two vintage brass compasses shown - one near top (North), one near bottom (South) of globe.
