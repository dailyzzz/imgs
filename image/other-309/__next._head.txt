5:T9b2,Antarctic ice shelves collage with 'Why don't we fall off the edge?' question. Four-panel photographic collage showing Antarctic ice formations with flat Earth edge question. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'WHY DON'T WE FALL OFF THE EDGE?' Four panels arranged 2x2 grid showing dramatic Antarctic scenery. Top left: Aerial view of red icebreaker ship navigating through broken sea ice and dark blue-black ocean water. Ship appears small against vast seascape with white ice floes scattered across water surface. Gray overcast sky. Top right: Massive tabular iceberg floating in calm ocean - distinctive flat-topped ice formation with vertical white-cream colored walls showing horizontal stratification layers. Iceberg appears house-sized with perfectly vertical cliffs. Deep teal-blue water, lighter blue-gray sky. Bottom left: Enormous ice shelf wall viewed from water level - massive vertical cliff face of pure white glacial ice extending horizontally across frame. Perfectly flat top edge like ruler-straight line against dark gray sky. Vertical striations and texture visible in ice face. Dark navy ocean water at base. Perspective emphasizes scale and geometric flatness of ice shelf edge. Bottom right: Another tabular iceberg with steep vertical walls - irregular angular shape floating in turquoise-blue water. White-cream ice shows layered structure. Lower right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in white text. Collage uses images of Antarctic ice shelves - particularly tabular icebergs and ice shelf edges with their characteristic flat tops and vertical faces - to suggest visual metaphor for 'edge of flat Earth'. Flat-topped icebergs result from ice shelf calving where chunks break off Antarctic ice sheet floating on ocean. Flat tops represent former surface of ice sheet. However, these are simply floating ice formations, not edge of world. Images show Antarctica's coastline where continental ice meets ocean, not planetary boundary. In flat Earth model, Antarctica forms ice wall around perimeter preventing people from reaching edge. However, Antarctica is well-explored continent at Earth's South Pole, circumnavigated many times, with permanent research stations from numerous countries. Ships regularly sail around it. No ice wall exists preventing circumnavigation. Gravity prevents 'falling off' - on sphere, 'down' points toward planetary center from all surface locations, so no edge exists to fall from0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 309 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Antarctic ice shelves collage with 'Why don't we fall off the edge?' question.
