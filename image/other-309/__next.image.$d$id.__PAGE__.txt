3:T9b2,Antarctic ice shelves collage with 'Why don't we fall off the edge?' question. Four-panel photographic collage showing Antarctic ice formations with flat Earth edge question. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'WHY DON'T WE FALL OFF THE EDGE?' Four panels arranged 2x2 grid showing dramatic Antarctic scenery. Top left: Aerial view of red icebreaker ship navigating through broken sea ice and dark blue-black ocean water. Ship appears small against vast seascape with white ice floes scattered across water surface. Gray overcast sky. Top right: Massive tabular iceberg floating in calm ocean - distinctive flat-topped ice formation with vertical white-cream colored walls showing horizontal stratification layers. Iceberg appears house-sized with perfectly vertical cliffs. Deep teal-blue water, lighter blue-gray sky. Bottom left: Enormous ice shelf wall viewed from water level - massive vertical cliff face of pure white glacial ice extending horizontally across frame. Perfectly flat top edge like ruler-straight line against dark gray sky. Vertical striations and texture visible in ice face. Dark navy ocean water at base. Perspective emphasizes scale and geometric flatness of ice shelf edge. Bottom right: Another tabular iceberg with steep vertical walls - irregular angular shape floating in turquoise-blue water. White-cream ice shows layered structure. Lower right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in white text. Collage uses images of Antarctic ice shelves - particularly tabular icebergs and ice shelf edges with their characteristic flat tops and vertical faces - to suggest visual metaphor for 'edge of flat Earth'. Flat-topped icebergs result from ice shelf calving where chunks break off Antarctic ice sheet floating on ocean. Flat tops represent former surface of ice sheet. However, these are simply floating ice formations, not edge of world. Images show Antarctica's coastline where continental ice meets ocean, not planetary boundary. In flat Earth model, Antarctica forms ice wall around perimeter preventing people from reaching edge. However, Antarctica is well-explored continent at Earth's South Pole, circumnavigated many times, with permanent research stations from numerous countries. Ships regularly sail around it. No ice wall exists preventing circumnavigation. Gravity prevents 'falling off' - on sphere, 'down' points toward planetary center from all surface locations, so no edge exists to fall from4:T9df,Person in ice cave with text about water level versus convexity argument. Atmospheric photograph with philosophical text overlaid making flat Earth water level argument. Top text in white sans-serif font: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows silhouette of person standing in opening of ice cave or glacier tunnel. Person appears small against massive ice formation, positioned in center looking outward. Ice walls visible on sides - brilliant white/light blue glacial ice with textured surface showing layers, cracks, formations. Opening frames view of outside landscape visible as bright light area. Sky beyond shows gradient from white to deep blue suggesting daytime with clear conditions. Person's silhouette backlit creating dramatic contrast - appears to be standing, possibly wearing jacket or backpack. Ice formations create natural arch/tunnel framing the scene. Blue lighting dominates image with cooler tones - characteristic of glacier/ice cave photography where thick ice filters sunlight creating ethereal blue glow. Text overlay in white centered on lower portion of image: 'If the Earth is spherical then it follows that the surface of all Earth's water, including the massive oceans, must maintain a certain degree of convexity. But this is contrary to the fundamental physical nature of water to always be and remain level!' Statement makes classic flat Earth argument about water finding its level. Claims convex water surface contradicts water's nature. Core misunderstanding: 'level' doesn't mean flat in absolute sense - means perpendicular to gravitational force direction. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface. Water DOES curve following Earth's sphere while remaining 'level' locally at every point. Gravity pulls toward Earth's center, not uniformly downward in absolute sense. Every location's 'down' points toward planetary core. Therefore water surfaces curve globally while appearing level locally. Observable evidence of water curvature: ships disappearing hull-first over horizon (water curves between observer and ship), inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon distance, submarine and ship navigation using spherical trigonometry, need for locks in Panama/Suez canals accounting for different 'sea level' (both tangent to sphere but different absolute heights). Image location in ice cave/glacier ironic since glaciers flow downhill following gravity, demonstrating water responds to gravitational field consistent with spherical Earth5:T91c,Spherical trigonometry calculations chart proving Earth curvature using AutoCAD precision. Complex mathematical infographic calculating hidden heights due to Earth's curvature across various distances. Title at top: 'SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY OF A SPHERE WITH 3959 MILES RADIUS PROVING THERE IS NO 8" PER MILE SQUARED RULE FOR A BALL EARTH (USING AutoCAD 2016 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Header text 'SAR 2/' upper right. Below title shows 'Merriam-Webster Definition: Sphere' with definition text 'A solid that is bounded by a surface consisting of all points at a given distance from a point constituting its center' next to small diagram of sphere labeled 'The Imaginary Ball Earth'. Main left portion displays NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Western Hemisphere with North and South America visible, Pacific Ocean, white clouds, appearing as sphere. Overlaid on Earth image: red horizontal line labeled 'SURFACE LINE 3959 MILES RADIUS' extending across hemisphere, yellow arc labeled '$3959 MILES RADIUS' curving from center, compass rose showing cardinal directions, distance scale showing 0-1000-2000-3000-3959 miles. Right side contains extensive data table with columns labeled 'Distance in Miles', 'By Google's Calculator', 'Sagitta (Hidden Height) (Using AutoCAD)', 'By Trig Formula'. Table lists distances from 1 mile to 3170 miles with corresponding calculations showing hidden height due to curvature. Values progress from tiny amounts (1 mile = 0.67 feet hidden) to massive amounts (3170 miles = 1,286,112.00 feet hidden). Bottom shows Excel formula: 'X=3959*(COS(Sin^-1(L/3959))))' and 'The Trig ©=Sin^-1(L/R) X=R-R(Cos(©))'. Credits 'S. Valente, M. Kahnke, Z. Mrabet, jan/22/2016'. Chart demonstrates rigorous mathematical calculation of Earth's curvature using spherical geometry. Shows that for 3959-mile radius sphere (Earth's mean radius), specific amounts of height become hidden at various distances. For example, at 3 miles = 6 feet hidden, at 100 miles = 6668 feet hidden. Calculations use proper spherical trigonometry rather than simplified '8 inches per mile squared' approximation. The '8 inch rule' is rough estimate only accurate for short distances - actual curvature formula more complex. Chart proves mathematically that if Earth is sphere with ~4000 mile radius, substantial curvature exists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-309","title":"Other 309","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747902_467916246741448_492441545354721726_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-308","title":"Other 308","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747465_465960070270399_9062437940598786058_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-310","title":"Other 310","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764408_467334173466322_8797735789174496278_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
