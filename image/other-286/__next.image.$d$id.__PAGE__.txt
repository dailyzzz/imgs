3:T8d5,Numbers and geometric structures diagram showing angles in digits with Fibonacci and prime number notation. Educational mathematical diagram displaying numbers 0-9 as geometric shapes with angle counts. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on black background shows stylized digits arranged in 3x3 grid plus header circle. Top center shows white circle labeled '0 Angle' representing zero. Upper left text in red italics: 'FIBONACCI NUMBERS', upper right in blue italics: 'PRIME NUMBERS'. Grid shows numbers 1-9, each designed with straight line segments forming angles marked in different colors. Number 1 (upper left): Red vertical line with single angle marked, labeled '1 Angle'. Number 2 (upper center): Blue angular shape resembling '2' with two marked angles, labeled '2 Angles'. Number 3 (upper right): Blue curved/angular '3' with three angles marked, labeled '3 Angles'. Number 4 (middle left): White angular '4' with four angles marked, labeled '4 Angles'. Number 5 (middle center): Red angular '5' shape with blue overlapping triangular structure showing five angles marked, labeled '5 Angles'. Number 6 (middle right): White angular design with six angles marked, labeled '6 Angles'. Number 7 (lower left): Blue angular '7' with seven angles marked, labeled '7 Angles'. Number 8 (lower center): Red symmetrical design composed of two triangles forming hourglass/double pyramid with eight angles marked, labeled '8 Angles'. Number 9 (lower right): White spiral/angular '9' design with nine angles marked, labeled '9 Angles'. Blue diagonal lines connect certain numbers suggesting relationships. Fibonacci sequence (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...) where each number sum of previous two. Prime numbers (2,3,5,7,11,13...) only divisible by 1 and themselves. Bottom text on beige border: 'NUMBERS AND GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES'. Diagram attempts to show mathematical patterns in number shapes, suggesting hidden geometry in numerical symbols. Concept related to sacred geometry and numerology popular in alternative cosmology communities. However, Arabic numeral shapes (0-9) are arbitrary cultural inventions - different writing systems use different symbols. Angle counting depends entirely on how digits are drawn4:T851,DIY Hubble Space Telescope satirical assembly instructions meme. Humorous infographic mocking Hubble Space Telescope construction with everyday household items. Top banner in bright cyan blue with yellow handwritten-style text 'DO IT YOURSELF' and large white bold text 'HUBBLE TELESCOPE!' Below shows six panels with white backgrounds separated by black borders, each containing simple 3D rendered illustration of common object with label underneath. Panel 1: Washing machine drum - metallic cylindrical drum with perforated holes, labeled '1. Washing Machine Drum'. Panel 2: Aluminum foil - roll of shiny silver foil partially unrolled, labeled '2. Aluminum Foil'. Panel 3: Toilet seat lid - white oval plastic toilet seat cover, labeled '3. Toilet Seat Lid'. Panel 4: TV dish antenna - gray satellite dish on stand, labeled '4. T.V. Dish Antenna'. Panel 5: Curved lens - gray convex optical lens shown in profile, labeled '5. Curved Lens'. Panel 6: Solar panels - black rectangular photovoltaic panel array, labeled '6. Solar Panels'. Lower portion shows black background with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white at upper right. Center displays photograph of actual Hubble Space Telescope in orbit - cylindrical spacecraft with distinctive solar panel wings, metallic gold-brown thermal insulation wrapping, various instruments and antennae protruding. Large white handwritten text 'Voila!' suggests final assembled product. Bottom shows red banner 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Satirical meme suggests Hubble telescope crudely assembled from cheap household items rather than sophisticated optical instrument. Implies space telescope imagery is fake, produced by low-budget contraption. However, Hubble launched 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery, built over decade by thousands of engineers at cost of $4.7 billion (inflation-adjusted ~$10B today). Contains 2.4-meter precision mirror, advanced spectrographs, infrared/ultraviolet cameras, operates in low Earth orbit at 547 km altitude. Has captured over 1.5 million observations transforming astronomy. Meme dismisses extraordinary engineering achievement as fraudulent apparatus5:T82a,Eight major phases of the moon diagram for flat Earth cosmology. Educational astronomical diagram showing lunar phases in flat Earth context. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central illustration on solid black background displays eight circular representations of moon phases arranged in two columns of four. Each phase numbered 1-8 with descriptive label below. Left column top to bottom: Phase 1 (NEW MOON): Completely dark circle appearing black/dark gray representing moon's dark side facing Earth. Phase 2 (WAXING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white illuminated on right side, rest dark, showing moon 12.5% illuminated. Phase 3 (FIRST QUARTER): Exactly half moon illuminated - right half cream-white, left half dark, 50% illuminated at right angle to sun. Phase 4 (WAXING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on left, 75% illuminated approaching full. Right column: Phase 5 (FULL MOON): Completely illuminated cream-white circle showing moon's fully lit face, 100% illuminated opposite sun. Phase 6 (WANING GIBBOUS): More than half illuminated - mostly cream-white with dark crescent on right side, 75% illuminated after full moon. Phase 7 (LAST QUARTER): Exactly half illuminated - left half cream-white, right half dark, 50% illuminated moving toward new moon. Phase 8 (WANING CRESCENT): Small crescent of cream-white on left side, rest dark, 12.5% illuminated approaching new moon. Phases arranged symmetrically showing progression through ~29.5-day lunar cycle. Bottom text on beige border: '8 MAJOR PHASES OF THE MOON'. Diagram accurately depicts phases as seen from Earth. However, flat Earth models struggle to explain lunar phases. Standard model: moon orbits Earth reflecting sunlight, different positions create phases. Flat Earth models propose various mechanisms: moon generates own light that turns on/off, transparent rotating moon, or localized spotlight sun. None adequately explain why same phase visible globally simultaneously or why phases correlate with moon's position relative to sun0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-286","title":"Other 286","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734152_464902100376196_1665637751964474831_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-285","title":"Other 285","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734022_464930290373377_7244195183032635053_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-287","title":"Other 287","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12734218_464902177042855_2692853735329290339_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
