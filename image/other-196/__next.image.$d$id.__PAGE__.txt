Bottom left corner watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Image argues that public education systems indoctrinate students with globe Earth model through repetition and authority rather than independent investigation. Cites Orwell (author of 1984) to suggest mainstream education is propaganda apparatus suppressing truth. Implies questioning institutional knowledge leads to social ostracism. Globe in graduate's hands symbolizes educational system literally putting worldview into students' possession without critical examination. Common flat Earth argument that people believe in globe Earth not because they've personally verified it, but because teachers, textbooks, and authority figures repeated it throughout childhood when critical thinking skills were undeveloped4:T4d7,European Space Agency Rosetta mission infographic with timeline and key moments.

Shows iconic Apollo mission imagery against pure black space background. Top third displays large white bold text: 'GOT STARS?' Center shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph - blue and white Earth partially visible rising above lunar horizon, showing cloud patterns, blue oceans, white swirls of atmosphere.

LM has distinctive gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, angular geometric shape with four landing legs/struts visible. American flag planted in lunar soil left of LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit visible near module. Scientific instruments and equipment scattered on gray regolith. Surface shows typical lunar dust, craters, rocks. Bottom left watermark: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Moon landing skeptics frequently point to complete absence of stars in Apollo photographs as evidence of studio fakery. Argue space should show millions of stars against black void, but photos show pure black sky. NASA explains this as camera exposure settings - bright sunlight reflecting off lunar surface and spacesuits required fast shutter speeds and small apertures, making dim stars invisible just as stars aren't visible in daytime Earth photography0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-196","title":"Other 196","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12565438_459893394210400_9196660274753455592_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-195","title":"Other 195","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552861_455841464615593_7783021761301399950_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-197","title":"Other 197","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12565566_456985911167815_7506546729553344199_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
