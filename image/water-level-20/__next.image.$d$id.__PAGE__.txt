3:T4e0,Screenshot of Wikipedia article on 'Fluid statics' with key passage highlighted. Header shows 'Fluid statics' with 'Main article: Fluid statics' link below. Article text reads: 'Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest. It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium; and is contrasted with fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red underlines emphasize final phrase 'the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red boxes also highlight 'Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics'. Uses mainstream scientific source (Wikipedia article on fluid statics/hydrostatics) to support flat Earth argument by citing established physics principle that water surface is always level and horizontal regardless of container shape. Argues this accepted scientific fact contradicts spherical Earth model where water must conform to curved surface4:T44e,Five-panel collage demonstrating water's level surface at multiple scales. Header text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with subtext 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTHS SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND'. Top panel shows stunning infinity pool overlooking turquoise ocean with tropical island and palm trees in distance, person relaxing in pool. Middle row shows three panels: left - glass with ice and beverage with visible level surface labeled 'FLAT', center - luxury infinity pool with ocean view and wooden deck labeled 'FLAT', right - aerial view of boat on turquoise water labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows large red banner stating 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. All water examples demonstrate perfectly horizontal level surfaces regardless of container size or location. Argues that observable property of water maintaining level surface in all containers (glass, pool, ocean) combined with Earth being 71% water proves planet must be flat plane. Uses progression from small scale (drinking glass) to large scale (ocean) to demonstrate consistency of water's levelness, concluding this proves Earth cannot be curved sphere5:T468,Five-panel meme demonstrating water's level property at all scales with Dr. Evil reference. Top row shows glass of clear water with reflection on left, and luxury modern bathtub with white towel on right. Middle section displays large text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with yellow spirit level tool (bubble level) showing centered bubble proving levelness. Fourth panel shows stunning tropical infinity pool with overwater bungalows, wooden deck with lounge chairs, crystal clear turquoise water merging seamlessly with ocean horizon. Bottom panel shows Dr. Evil character (Mike Myers from Austin Powers) in gray outfit with pinkie finger raised to mouth making exaggerated expression, with quote '"CONSPIRACY THEORY"' in white text. Watermark 'FLAT EARTH LUNACY'. Meme argues that water's observable level property in all containers (glass, bathtub, infinity pool, ocean) is established physics, using spirit level as proof. Bottom panel sarcastically suggests calling water's levelness a 'conspiracy theory' is absurd when it's demonstrable fact, implying those who deny observable water levelness are the real conspiracy theorists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-20","title":"Water Level 20","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53403647_3121354081223608_5848837827483140096_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-19","title":"Water Level 19","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/50654736_174771240171720_3295504646461718528_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-21","title":"Water Level 21","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53450783_2169586853100741_162883413475328000_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
