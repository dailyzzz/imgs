3:T4ce,Shel Silverstein 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' book cover with flat Earth edge imagery. Cream/beige aged paper background. Top text in serif font: 'the poems and drawings of Shel Silverstein'. Classic black ink line drawing shows whimsical scene of child and dog at literal edge of sidewalk/world. Left side has wooden signpost reading 'EDGE KEEP OFF'. Girl with pigtails wearing dress sits on edge of flat surface/cliff holding rope or leash. Small scruffy dog dangles over edge holding onto rope with mouth. Various small objects (shoes, items) fall into void below. Empty white space below represents drop-off into nothingness. Right side shows scraggly vegetation/grass. Bottom shows large black serif text: 'Where the Sidewalk Ends'. Famous 1974 children's poetry collection by Shel Silverstein. Original book about imagination and adventure where normal world ends. Flat Earth proponents use this imagery literally - suggesting Silverstein illustrated actual Earth's edge where civilization (sidewalk) meets boundary (ice wall/Antarctica). Child's innocent perspective represents truth hidden in plain sight in children's literature. Argues mainstream culture subconsciously knows Earth is flat, embedded in cultural touchstones4:T4aa,R.E.M. song lyric meme about paradigm shift acceptance. Dramatic CGI image of Earth experiencing catastrophic destruction. Shows spherical globe Earth split/cracking with bright orange-yellow flames and explosions erupting from surface. Left side appears mostly intact showing blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents. Right side consumed by fire with massive plumes of orange flames and smoke. Bright yellow-white explosion/sunburst effect on right edge. Black starry space background with scattered stars and subtle nebula clouds visible. Top banner in gray serif font: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center shows large black serif text: 'IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL FINE'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. References R.E.M.'s 1987 song 'It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)' about accepting major changes. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests discovering Earth is flat means end of mainstream worldview but person feels liberated rather than distressed. Uses apocalyptic imagery of Earth's destruction to represent shattering of globe Earth paradigm. Argues flat Earth awakening destroys old belief system but brings peace through truth rather than fear5:T462,Massive tabular iceberg in Antarctic waters showing ice wall concept. Photograph shows enormous flat-topped iceberg with perfectly level horizontal surface. Ice formation appears bright white with subtle blue tints. Top surface remarkably flat and smooth like tabletop extending across width of image. Vertical ice cliff face shows horizontal stratification layers from snow/ice compression over millennia. Face appears sheer and perpendicular to water surface. Small chunks of broken ice visible at waterline. Dark gray-blue ocean water in foreground shows gentle waves and ripples. Overcast gray sky creates moody atmosphere. Background shows more ice formations fading into atmospheric haze. Tabular icebergs form when large sections break off Antarctic ice shelf. This type commonly cited by flat Earth proponents as evidence of ice wall surrounding Earth's edge. Argues Antarctica isn't continent at bottom of globe but circular ice wall encircling flat Earth plane, preventing water from flowing off edges and keeping civilizations contained in center disk. Perfectly flat top surface reinforces flat plane cosmology0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-185","title":"Other 185","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525377_455802321286174_1896089488163690549_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-184","title":"Other 184","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525328_460139877519085_6793993696164180013_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-186","title":"Other 186","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525409_461770357356037_945031612290821477_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
