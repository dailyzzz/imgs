5:T4ce,Shel Silverstein 'Where the Sidewalk Ends' book cover with flat Earth edge imagery. Cream/beige aged paper background. Top text in serif font: 'the poems and drawings of Shel Silverstein'. Classic black ink line drawing shows whimsical scene of child and dog at literal edge of sidewalk/world. Left side has wooden signpost reading 'EDGE KEEP OFF'. Girl with pigtails wearing dress sits on edge of flat surface/cliff holding rope or leash. Small scruffy dog dangles over edge holding onto rope with mouth. Various small objects (shoes, items) fall into void below. Empty white space below represents drop-off into nothingness. Right side shows scraggly vegetation/grass. Bottom shows large black serif text: 'Where the Sidewalk Ends'. Famous 1974 children's poetry collection by Shel Silverstein. Original book about imagination and adventure where normal world ends. Flat Earth proponents use this imagery literally - suggesting Silverstein illustrated actual Earth's edge where civilization (sidewalk) meets boundary (ice wall/Antarctica). Child's innocent perspective represents truth hidden in plain sight in children's literature.
