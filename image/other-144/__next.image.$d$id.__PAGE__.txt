3:T491,Historical black and white photograph from 1955 showing Admiral Richard E. Byrd in television interview setting. Two men seated in dark leather chairs - left figure (civilian) wearing dark suit, glasses, and bow tie holds notepad, appears to be interviewer. Right figure (Admiral Byrd) wears light-colored military dress uniform with rank insignia, medals and decorations visible on chest. Behind them on wall is large azimuthal equidistant map projection showing flat Earth model with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map clearly visible above 'ATLANTIC OCEAN' text. Bottom text overlay: 'ADMIRAL BYRD IN FRONT OF AN AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT MAP - 1955'. Getty Images watermark 'NBC NewsWire' visible. Bottom corner shows '1450110923' and 'memes.com'. Admiral Byrd was famous polar explorer who led expeditions to Antarctica. Flat Earth proponents cite his use of azimuthal equidistant projection as evidence he knew true shape of Earth. However, this map projection is standard for polar navigation/aviation regardless of belief in spherical Earth. Image suggests official military/government use of flat Earth map model in 1950s television broadcasts4:T4d4,Portrait photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with quote overlay. Shows Einstein in his later years with characteristic wild white hair, gray mustache and goatee, deep facial wrinkles showing age and wisdom. Wearing dark gray suit jacket and light blue collared shirt. Hands clasped together in contemplative gesture near face. Warm brown/sepia background gives thoughtful atmosphere. Einstein gazes slightly off-camera with gentle, knowing expression. Top right watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo. White text overlay at bottom reads: '"I have come to believe that the motion of the Earth cannot be detected by any optical experiment."— Albert Einstein'. Quote taken from Einstein's work on relativity, suggesting Earth's motion through space is undetectable through direct observation. Flat Earth proponents use this quote to argue if motion cannot be detected, perhaps Earth is stationary rather than moving through space. Context: Einstein's actual point was about relative motion and frames of reference in special/general relativity, not Earth being stationary. Quote mined to support flat Earth perspective by implying scientific authority (Einstein) acknowledged problems with Earth's supposed motion5:T465,Black background with white text quote and azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map icon. Left side shows white-bordered square containing high-contrast black and white flat Earth map projection with North Pole at center, continents visible in black silhouettes against white background. Bottom left text reads 'Investigate flat earth.' in gray sans-serif font. Right side displays white text quote: 'There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation.' Attribution below: '(Herbert Spencer)' in parentheses. Bottom right shows 'JM' logo in gray. Quote from philosopher Herbert Spencer argues that dismissing ideas without investigation ensures ignorance. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests people reject flat Earth theory due to prejudice rather than genuine examination of evidence. Argues mainstream dismissal of flat Earth is emotional/social conformity rather than rational scientific evaluation. Calls for open-minded investigation before forming conclusions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-144","title":"Other 144","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439062_453778468155226_3501745846254491879_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-143","title":"Other 143","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12417925_454408474758892_8393684562037468442_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-145","title":"Other 145","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12439156_451896538343419_2749766266179285728_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
