5:T491,Historical black and white photograph from 1955 showing Admiral Richard E. Byrd in television interview setting. Two men seated in dark leather chairs - left figure (civilian) wearing dark suit, glasses, and bow tie holds notepad, appears to be interviewer. Right figure (Admiral Byrd) wears light-colored military dress uniform with rank insignia, medals and decorations visible on chest. Behind them on wall is large azimuthal equidistant map projection showing flat Earth model with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map clearly visible above 'ATLANTIC OCEAN' text. Bottom text overlay: 'ADMIRAL BYRD IN FRONT OF AN AZIMUTHAL EQUIDISTANT MAP - 1955'. Getty Images watermark 'NBC NewsWire' visible. Bottom corner shows '1450110923' and 'memes.com'. Admiral Byrd was famous polar explorer who led expeditions to Antarctica. Flat Earth proponents cite his use of azimuthal equidistant projection as evidence he knew true shape of Earth. However, this map projection is standard for polar navigation/aviation regardless of belief in spherical Earth. Image suggests official military/government use of flat Earth map model in 1950s television broadcasts0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 144 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical black and white photograph from 1955 showing Admiral Richard E.
