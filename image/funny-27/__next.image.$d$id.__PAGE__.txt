Background shows 'March 7-16 Austin 2014' and 'Music Film Interactive' conference signage. Large yellow text overlay reads 'That stuff is FLAT!' in bold letters. Humorous out-of-context quote suggesting famous science communicator is admitting Earth is flat, though likely referring to something else entirely.
