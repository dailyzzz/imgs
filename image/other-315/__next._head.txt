5:Tafd,Apollo moon landing versus film studio set comparison suggesting moon missions were faked. Two-panel comparison photograph implying moon landings were filmed on Earth rather than lunar surface. Left panel shows iconic Apollo moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit standing on lunar surface beside Lunar Module descent stage. Astronaut salutes American flag planted in gray lunar soil. Flag appears to wave despite no atmosphere. Golden-foil wrapped LM visible with ladder, landing legs, various equipment. Surface shows gray regolith (moon dust/rock), bootprints visible. Harsh shadows suggest single light source (sun). Black sky with no visible stars. Scene lit with high contrast typical of lunar photography. Right panel shows film studio or production stage - large indoor facility with high ceilings, industrial lighting rigs visible overhead. Set dressed to resemble lunar surface with gray artificial terrain/sand. Full-scale mockup of Lunar Module visible - gold foil wrapped descent stage identical to real LM. Astronaut in white spacesuit (or costume) standing on set. American flag planted in fake regolith. Large green screen visible in background for chroma key compositing. Studio floor, lighting equipment, scaffolding, crew/equipment visible around edges showing clearly artificial environment. Multiple overhead lights creating studio lighting setup. Bottom text spans both panels in large bold white letters on black background: 'YOU CAN FOOL ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME IF YOUR EFFECTS BUDGET IS LARGE ENOUGH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Quote plays on Abraham Lincoln's famous saying 'You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.' Meme argues moon landings were elaborate hoax using Hollywood special effects. Right panel shows genuine film set or museum exhibit recreating moon landing for educational/entertainment purposes - common for documentaries, movies, museums to build replicas. However, comparing training mockup or film recreation to actual moon landing photos doesn't prove hoax. Apollo missions produced 8,400+ photos, 7 hours of video, 842 pounds of lunar samples (returned by 6 different missions), retroreflectors still used today for laser ranging experiments, testimony from 400,000+ NASA employees/contractors, independent verification by Soviet Union (Cold War adversary who tracked missions), ongoing satellite imagery showing landing sites with equipment still visible, and technological impossibility of faking continuous live TV broadcasts with 1960s effects technology. Studio photo shows what WOULD be needed to fake it - but such sets used for training, education, or recreation of historical events, not original footage0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 315 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo moon landing versus film studio set comparison suggesting moon missions were faked.
