Implies he applies gravity as universal explanation for all phenomena regardless of validity, referencing perception that gravity is invoked to explain away contradictions in heliocentric model. Mocking tone suggests scientific establishment uses gravity as catch-all excuse rather than legitimate force"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-12","title":"Gravity 12","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/31502608_531645823897605_1534112449265926144_n.jpeg","description":"Viral 'Side-Eye Chloe' meme format featuring young blonde girl (Chloe Clem) with long hair sitting in car seat with skeptical sideways glance expression. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'SO YOU'RE SAYING'. Bottom text with rainbow gradient: 'SOMETIMES GRAVITY MAKES THINGS STICK TO STUFF, AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT ORBIT AROUND STUFF?' Questions inconsistency in gravity explanation - why does gravity make objects stick to Earth's surface (downward attraction) but make moon orbit around Earth (sideways motion) rather than crashing into it. Child's skeptical expression emphasizes perceived absurdity of gravity simultaneously causing adhesion and orbital motion. Popular meme format repurposed to highlight flat Earth argument that gravity theory contains logical contradictions"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-14","title":"Gravity 14","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/34510275_2219864411361686_7769784632341430272_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme mocking Einstein gravity demonstration. Top panel shows people around blue fabric trampoline/rubber sheet with balls demonstrating spacetime curvature, captioned 'When your Einstein theory of Gravity experiment demonstrates mass warping space-time'. Trampoline shows yellow tennis ball creating depression with smaller balls (representing planets) rolling toward center, meant to visualize how massive objects curve spacetime. Bottom panel shows two people (one wearing blue, one in pink) saluting with exaggerated expressions, captioned 'And then ALL the planets Crash into each other at the center! LOOK AT YOUR PRECIOUS GRAVITY' and 'LOOK AT IT!!' Satirizes common physics demonstration arguing that if gravity worked as shown (objects rolling into depression), all planets would spiral into sun rather than maintain stable orbits. Questions why visual demonstration shows objects falling together while actual solar system remains stable, suggesting gravity model is flawed"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
