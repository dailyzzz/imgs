3:T7d1,Pop art comic style meme about silence proving Earth not spinning. Retro comic book panel format mocking expectation of hearing Earth's rotation. Top text in large bold white letters: 'SHH.... DO YOU HEAR THAT?' Image shows classic pop art illustration in Roy Lichtenstein style. Man on left with black hair in blue shirt/collar leans toward woman on right whispering with hand cupped near mouth in secretive gesture. Man has dramatic expression with one eye closed, thin mustache, angular features typical of comic art. Woman on right has blonde short hair, defined features, bright blue eyes with long lashes, red lipstick, purple/lavender clothing or earring visible. Both drawn in bold black outlines with Ben-Day dots halftone pattern. Background bright yellow with black polka dot screen print texture characteristic of 1960s comic books and pop art. Lower right shows 'JM' artist signature. Small rectangular overlay shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom text in bold white letters with black outline: 'THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE EARTH NOT SPINNING'. Meme suggests we should hear Earth's rotation if planet were spinning - since we hear silence, Earth must be stationary. Classic flat Earth argument about lacking perception of motion. However, argument ignores physics of reference frames and inertial motion. We don't 'hear' Earth's rotation because: 1) Atmosphere rotates with surface (no wind rushing past), 2) We're in same reference frame as everything around us (constant velocity produces no sensation), 3) Sound requires medium vibration - smooth rotation doesn't create sound. Similar to how airplane passengers don't 'hear' plane moving at 500 mph through cabin - only turbulence or acceleration creates sensation. Earth's rotation is smooth, constant. We DO feel it indirectly through: Coriolis effect on weather patterns, Foucault pendulum rotation, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, day/night cycle. Silence proves smooth motion, not stationary position4:T82f,Father and son beach scene gravitational waves versus ocean waves joke meme. Humorous photograph playing on confusion between gravitational waves and ocean waves. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'DADDY ARE THOSE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES?' Image shows father and young son standing on beach looking at ocean. Father (adult male) on right wears gray zip-up hoodie, blue jeans, baseball cap, has dark facial hair. He points toward ocean with right arm extended. Son (young boy, appears 6-8 years old) stands to father's left wearing dark jacket or hoodie, baseball cap, light colored pants. Boy looks up at father with curious expression. Background shows peaceful beach scene with calm ocean water extending to horizon line - gentle waves visible on surface. Sky above shows partly cloudy conditions with white and gray clouds scattered across light blue-gray sky. Beach sand appears light tan/beige in foreground. Ocean appears gray-blue. Lighting suggests overcast day or early morning/late afternoon. Scene captures teaching moment between parent and child. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'NO SON, THOSE WAVES ARE REAL'. Lower left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Meme jokes about difference between visible ocean waves (mechanical disturbances in water) versus invisible gravitational waves (ripples in spacetime fabric). Gravitational waves can't be seen with naked eye - require sophisticated interferometers like LIGO to detect. Child's innocent question treats term literally, thinking gravitational waves look like water waves. Father's response implies gravitational waves aren't 'real' in observable sense. Flat Earth context: community skeptical of gravitational waves detection, viewing it as unprovable abstract concept unlike tangible ocean waves. However, gravitational waves are real - detected multiple times since 2015 by LIGO and Virgo observatories from merging black holes and neutron stars, confirming Einstein's predictions. Just because phenomenon isn't visible doesn't mean it's not real - similar to radio waves, magnetic fields, or atoms5:T7ac,Flat Earth map showing analemma sun path and flight routes diagram. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with flight paths and solar patterns labeled as analemma. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central circular map on black background shows continents in bright green. North Pole at center with landmasses radiating outward: North America on right side, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia across top and upper left, Australia lower left. Black ocean areas surround green continents. Outer edge shows thick light blue/white ring representing ice wall or Antarctic barrier. Multiple concentric circular lines in different colors overlay map representing climate zones, tropics, or sun paths: Outermost white/light blue ring (Antarctic Circle), red circle (Tropic of Capricorn area), yellow/orange circle (Tropic of Cancer area), smaller circles toward center. Several curved dotted lines trace across map appearing to show flight paths or sun's analemma pattern - lines curve in arcs connecting different locations. White dashed line curves from near Africa across Pacific toward South America. Red dashed line arcs from Asia area. Yellow/orange curved line near center. Labels partially visible reading 'IS CANCERI...' (likely Tropic of Cancer), 'ANTARCTIC...' (Antarctic Circle), other geographic markers. Bottom text on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Analemma typically refers to figure-8 pattern sun traces in sky over year when photographed from same location at same time daily - results from Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit. This diagram attempts to show analemma on flat Earth map, but unclear how flat Earth model would produce this pattern. Lines might also represent claimed airline flight paths that allegedly make more sense on flat map than globe (though this is projection distortion illusion - routes are actually great circles on sphere). Map uses vintage aesthetic with beige border0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-290","title":"Other 290","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742357_466263566906716_2768320922267363826_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-289","title":"Other 289","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742034_464257780440628_8646076977378045823_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-291","title":"Other 291","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742400_464902280376178_8340434939850423488_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
