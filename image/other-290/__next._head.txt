5:T7d1,Pop art comic style meme about silence proving Earth not spinning. Retro comic book panel format mocking expectation of hearing Earth's rotation. Top text in large bold white letters: 'SHH.... DO YOU HEAR THAT?' Image shows classic pop art illustration in Roy Lichtenstein style. Man on left with black hair in blue shirt/collar leans toward woman on right whispering with hand cupped near mouth in secretive gesture. Man has dramatic expression with one eye closed, thin mustache, angular features typical of comic art. Woman on right has blonde short hair, defined features, bright blue eyes with long lashes, red lipstick, purple/lavender clothing or earring visible. Both drawn in bold black outlines with Ben-Day dots halftone pattern. Background bright yellow with black polka dot screen print texture characteristic of 1960s comic books and pop art. Lower right shows 'JM' artist signature. Small rectangular overlay shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text. Bottom text in bold white letters with black outline: 'THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE EARTH NOT SPINNING'. Meme suggests we should hear Earth's rotation if planet were spinning - since we hear silence, Earth must be stationary. Classic flat Earth argument about lacking perception of motion. However, argument ignores physics of reference frames and inertial motion. We don't 'hear' Earth's rotation because: 1) Atmosphere rotates with surface (no wind rushing past), 2) We're in same reference frame as everything around us (constant velocity produces no sensation), 3) Sound requires medium vibration - smooth rotation doesn't create sound. Similar to how airplane passengers don't 'hear' plane moving at 500 mph through cabin - only turbulence or acceleration creates sensation. Earth's rotation is smooth, constant. We DO feel it indirectly through: Coriolis effect on weather patterns, Foucault pendulum rotation, different stars visible from different latitudes, time zones, day/night cycle. Silence proves smooth motion, not stationary position0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 290 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Pop art comic style meme about silence proving Earth not spinning.
