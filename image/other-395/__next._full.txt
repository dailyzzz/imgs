13:T1c37,Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming "Pilots never account for curvature." Flat Earth meme using aviation imagery to argue pilots don't adjust for Earth's curve during flight, presented as evidence that Earth is flat. IMAGE: Professional photograph taken from inside commercial aircraft cockpit during flight, showing both pilots, instrument panels, and view through windscreen. COCKPIT ENVIRONMENT: Modern commercial aircraft flight deck - appears to be Boeing 777 or similar wide-body aircraft based on instrument layout. Glass cockpit with multiple digital displays (Primary Flight Display, Navigation Display, Engine instruments). Overhead panel visible at top of frame showing numerous switches, buttons, and controls - typical of commercial aircraft systems (hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical, lighting). Green backlighting on overhead panel labels - standard for aircraft instrument lighting. Center pedestal between pilots with throttle quadrant, radio panels, and flight management system controls. PILOTS: Two pilots visible from behind - Captain (left seat) and First Officer (right seat). Both wearing white uniform shirts with epaulettes indicating rank. Seated in flight deck seats with headrests visible. Hands on controls - one pilot's hand visible on control yoke. Professional commercial pilots operating aircraft in cruise flight. VIEW THROUGH WINDSCREEN: High-altitude view showing: Horizon line where sky meets earth/clouds below. Beautiful gradient sky - deep blue at top transitioning to lighter blue, then orange/pink near horizon suggesting sunrise or sunset timing. Cloud layer visible below aircraft altitude. Horizon appears straight/flat across windscreen (expected visual appearance at any altitude - curvature is too gradual to perceive from aircraft windows). Earth's surface or lower clouds visible below with various colors and textures. TEXT OVERLAY: Bottom text (white Impact font): "PILOTS NEVER ACCOUNT FOR CURVATURE" - Makes claim about aviation procedures. "fb.com/fematters" attribution at top. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO CURVATURE ADJUSTMENT: Flat Earthers claim pilots don't adjust aircraft pitch/attitude to follow Earth's curve. On spherical Earth, plane would have to constantly nose down to maintain altitude as Earth curves away beneath it. Since pilots don't do this, Earth must be flat. 2) FLAT HORIZON: Horizon visible through cockpit appears flat/straight. If Earth were curved, horizon should appear curved from altitude. Since it looks flat, Earth is flat. 3) PILOT TESTIMONY: Some flat Earthers claim pilots privately admit they don't account for curvature. Training doesn't include curvature corrections. Navigation uses flat maps. If Earth were sphere, aviation would be impossible or radically different. 4) GYROSCOPE ARGUMENT: Aircraft attitude indicators (artificial horizons) are gyroscopic - they maintain orientation in space. If Earth curved, gyroscope would show nose-up attitude change over long flights. Since gyros don't show this, Earth isn't curving. WHY THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG: 1) GRAVITY DOES THE WORK: Aircraft in flight experiences gravity pulling toward Earth's center. "Level flight" means flying perpendicular to gravity - which automatically follows Earth's curve. Pilots don't manually adjust because gravity/physics handle it. It's like asking why you don't "adjust" while walking to keep your feet on the ground - gravity does it automatically. No pilot "accounts for" gravity consciously - they just maintain altitude. 2) WHAT "LEVEL" MEANS: In aviation, "level" means maintaining constant altitude above mean sea level (MSL). Altimeters measure pressure, which changes with altitude. Flying "level" according to altimeter automatically follows Earth's curve. Maintaining 35,000 feet MSL means staying same distance from Earth's surface, which curves. Pilots DO "account for curvature" - it's built into what "level flight" means. 3) ARTIFICIAL HORIZON PHYSICS: Aircraft attitude indicators are gravity-referenced, not space-referenced. They show pitch relative to local gravity vector, not absolute orientation in space. As Earth curves, local "down" direction changes - but this happens to both aircraft AND instrument. Gyros are designed with "erection mechanisms" that align them with local gravity over time. This is deliberate engineering because "level" must mean level relative to Earth, not space. 4) VISIBLE CURVATURE: From commercial aircraft cruise altitude (35,000-45,000 feet), Earth's curvature IS visible but subtle. Field of view through cockpit windows is too narrow to easily perceive curvature. Wide-angle photographs from aircraft DO show slight horizon curve. Curvature becomes obvious at higher altitudes (space, very high altitude aircraft). 5) NAVIGATION PROVES SPHERICAL EARTH: Flight routes calculated using great circle navigation (shortest paths on sphere). Flight times match spherical Earth distances, not flat Earth distances. Transoceanic flights would take dramatically different times on flat vs spherical Earth. GPS navigation works by triangulating from satellites orbiting spherical Earth. All international aviation operates on spherical Earth model because it works. 6) PILOT TRAINING REALITY: Pilots are trained in physics, aerodynamics, navigation - all based on spherical Earth model. Navigation charts use projections that account for Earth's shape. Time zone changes, day/night patterns, seasonal variations all match spherical Earth predictions. No pilot reports surprise at flight times being wrong - they're calculated accurately using spherical geometry. COCKPIT IMAGE ANALYSIS: What image actually shows: Normal commercial flight operations. Horizon appearing straight (expected - too distant to see curvature clearly). Professional pilots using instruments designed for spherical Earth. Level flight maintained by constant altitude, which automatically follows Earth's curve. Nothing in image contradicts spherical Earth - image shows exactly what you'd expect on spherical Earth. APPEAL OF THIS ARGUMENT: Argument is effective because: Aviation seems technical and authoritative. Most people don't understand flight physics. "Pilots don't adjust for curvature" sounds like damning evidence. Creates impression that spherical Earth should require constant obvious adjustment. Misunderstands how gravity and altitude work together. PILOT RESPONSES: Professional pilots regularly debunk this claim: Explain that level flight by definition follows Earth's curve. Note that navigation software assumes spherical Earth and works perfectly. Point out that flight routes match great circle paths on sphere. Describe how international flights would be impossible if Earth were flat. Flat Earth flight route predictions don't match actual flight times. VISUAL RHETORIC: Cockpit imagery is impressive and technical. Suggests insider/expert knowledge about aviation. Sunset lighting creates beautiful, engaging photograph. Professional pilots visible suggests credibility. Simple text claim allows viewers to accept without questioning. Works if viewer doesn't understand that "maintaining altitude" automatically accounts for curvature.14:T1967,Earth from space against starfield with text claiming "It's 2016 and we still don't have any video footage of the whole Earth spinning from space." Flat Earth meme demanding continuous full-Earth rotation video as proof of spherical spinning planet, arguing absence of such footage proves Earth doesn't spin or isn't sphere. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Classic "Earth from space" photograph showing full disk of planet against black star-filled background with flat Earth argument text overlay. EARTH IMAGE: Full disk photograph of Earth showing planet as complete sphere. Blue oceans dominate visible hemisphere. White cloud formations swirling across surface - weather patterns visible. Continental landmasses visible - appears to show Western Hemisphere (Americas) or view including North America. Atmospheric haze visible at edges creating soft limb against black space. Terminator line (day/night boundary) may be visible depending on sun angle. Classic "Blue Marble" style photograph. SPACE BACKGROUND: Black space surrounding Earth. Stars visible as white points of light scattered across background. Colorful nebula-like formations visible - purple, blue, green cosmic clouds. This artistic starfield background suggests image may be composite or enhanced for visual appeal. Authentic space photos typically show fewer visible stars due to camera exposure settings optimized for bright Earth. LIGHTING: Earth illuminated by sun from one side. Shadows and highlights show three-dimensional spherical shape. Cloud formations cast shadows on surface below. Consistent lighting across image suggests single light source (sun). TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "IT'S 2016" and "AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY VIDEO FOOTAGE" - Establishes time frame and makes claim about missing evidence. BOTTOM TEXT: "OF THE WHOLE EARTH SPINNING FROM SPACE" - Specifies what evidence flat Earthers claim is lacking. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO SPINNING EARTH VIDEO: Flat Earthers claim there's no continuous video showing Earth as complete sphere rotating over 24-hour period. If Earth really spins, why can't we see video of it spinning? NASA should easily be able to provide this "obvious" proof. Absence of such video is presented as evidence that Earth doesn't spin or isn't spherical. 2) ALL IMAGES ARE COMPOSITES/CGI: Flat Earthers argue NASA Earth images are: Computer generated (CGI). Composites stitched from multiple photos. Artistic renderings, not photographs. None show "real" continuous spinning because it doesn't happen. 3) SATELLITE LIMITATIONS: Claim that satellites capable of filming whole Earth don't exist. Geostationary satellites are too close to see whole planet. Deep space probes are conveniently positioned where they can't film Earth spinning. 4) PROOF SHOULD BE EASY: With modern technology, continuous Earth rotation video should be trivial to obtain. The fact that NASA doesn't provide it suggests it's impossible because Earth doesn't actually spin. WHY THIS ARGUMENT IS WRONG: 1) SUCH FOOTAGE EXISTS: DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) satellite at L1 Lagrange point provides daily images of full Earth disk. EPIC camera on DSCOVR captures Earth every 1-2 hours showing rotation. Himawari-8 Japanese weather satellite provides full-disk images every 10 minutes. GOES weather satellites provide continuous Western/Eastern hemisphere views. Time-lapse compilations of these images clearly show Earth rotation. 2) PHYSICS OF ORBITAL OBSERVATION: Low Earth orbit satellites (ISS, most imaging satellites) orbit at 250-500 miles altitude - too close to see full disk. They see curved horizon, not complete sphere. Geostationary satellites at 22,236 miles see full disk but of one hemisphere (they're "stationary" relative to Earth's rotation). To see Earth spin, you need camera far from Earth that isn't orbiting (like DSCOVR at L1 point, 1 million miles away). 3) CAMERA EXPOSURE CHALLENGES: Earth is very bright compared to stars. Camera exposure settings that properly expose Earth make stars invisible. Camera settings that show stars overexpose Earth into white blob. This is basic photography - not evidence of fakery. Space photos with visible stars AND properly exposed Earth are composites (honestly labeled as such). 4) DSCOVR/EPIC SPECIFICALLY: DSCOVR satellite launched 2015 specifically provides full-disk Earth images. Located at L1 Lagrange point, 1 million miles from Earth toward Sun. EPIC camera captures full Earth every 1-2 hours. Images clearly show: Earth rotating (continents move across disk). Day/night terminator progressing. Moon passing between satellite and Earth (transit events). Weather systems developing and moving. All publicly available at NASA EPIC website. 5) TIME-LAPSE VIDEOS: Multiple time-lapse videos compiled from satellite imagery show Earth spinning. Japanese Himawari-8 footage particularly impressive - full disk every 10 minutes since 2015. Weather channel and others regularly broadcast this footage. "No video exists" claim is simply false - it's easily findable online. 2016 CONTEXT: Image dated 2016 based on text. DSCOVR launched February 2015, EPIC images available from mid-2015. By 2016, full-disk spinning Earth footage was already publicly available. Claim was already outdated when image was created. Either creator was unaware of DSCOVR/Himawari footage, or deliberately ignored it. MOVING GOALPOSTS: When confronted with DSCOVR/Himawari footage, flat Earthers typically: Claim footage is CGI (unfalsifiable). Claim footage doesn't show "real" spinning (special pleading). Demand different specific footage (moving goalposts). Claim source is untrustworthy (genetic fallacy). No footage would satisfy because conclusion (flat Earth) is predetermined. VISUAL RHETORIC: Beautiful Earth image creates emotional engagement. Starfield background is aesthetically pleasing. Text makes claim seem reasonable without providing evidence it's true. "It's 2016" framing suggests technological capability that should make proof easy. Question format invites viewer to wonder "yeah, why DON'T we have that?" Works if viewer unaware that such footage exists and is publicly available. IRONY: Image literally shows spherical Earth while claiming lack of evidence for spherical Earth. Uses NASA-style Earth imagery to argue NASA doesn't provide real Earth imagery. Makes easily disprovable claim about non-existence of footage that exists. Demonstrates flat Earth community's failure to research before making claims.15:T1a00,NASA Earth photograph against black background with wordplay text: "I used to think NASA's pictures of Earth were unbelievable... Turns out, I was right." Flat Earth meme using double meaning of "unbelievable" - initially suggesting amazement, then revealing meaning as literally not to be believed (fake). Clever rhetorical device making conspiracy claim through linguistic twist. IMAGE: High-quality photograph of Earth from space showing full disk of planet against black background. Classic "Blue Marble" style image showing Earth as sphere. EARTH IMAGE DETAILS: Full disk Earth photograph - entire visible hemisphere shown. Asia-Pacific region prominently displayed - Australia visible in lower portion. China, Southeast Asia, Indonesia archipelago visible. Cloud formations swirling across surface - white against blue oceans and brown/green landmasses. Indian Ocean visible on left side. Pacific Ocean visible on right side. Arctic ice cap visible at top (northern regions). Clear atmospheric limb at edges - thin haze showing atmosphere. Three-dimensional appearance from lighting - sun illuminating from one side creating shadows and depth. "JM" text visible on image - possibly watermark or identifier. BACKGROUND: Pure black space background surrounding Earth. No stars visible - typical of properly exposed Earth photographs (camera settings optimize for bright Earth, making dim stars invisible). Clean, high-contrast image. IMAGE QUALITY: Sharp, detailed photograph. Professional quality - likely from NASA or similar space agency. Shows continental details, cloud structures, ocean colors. Appears to be genuine satellite or deep space photograph (possibly from DSCOVR, Apollo, or similar mission). TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "I USED TO THINK NASA'S PICTURES OF EARTH WERE UNBELIEVABLE" - Sets up expectation that speaker initially found images amazing/impressive. BOTTOM TEXT: "TURNS OUT, I WAS RIGHT" - Twist reveals "unbelievable" meant literally - not worthy of belief, fake. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. RHETORICAL ANALYSIS: This meme uses classic comedic misdirection: 1) SETUP: "Unbelievable" typically used as positive descriptor meaning "amazing, incredible, impressive." Reader assumes speaker was awed by beautiful Earth photos. 2) PUNCHLINE: "I was right" reveals speaker meant literal definition of "unbelievable" - something that should not be believed, something fake/false. What seemed like compliment is revealed as accusation of fakery. 3) LINGUISTIC CLEVERNESS: Uses ambiguity of English word to deliver conspiracy message through humor. More memorable and shareable than straightforward claim. Creates "aha moment" that feels like insight rather than assertion. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NASA IMAGES ARE FAKE: Core claim is that NASA photographs of Earth are fabricated - computer generated, composited, or otherwise not genuine photographs of real spherical Earth. 2) TOO PERFECT: Implicit argument that NASA images look "too good to be true" - therefore they must be fake. Beauty itself becomes evidence of fabrication. 3) DISTRUST OF NASA: Assumes NASA lies routinely about space, Earth's shape, and imagery. Part of broader flat Earth narrative that space agencies worldwide deceive public. 4) ALL EARTH PHOTOS FAKE: By extension, all "Earth from space" imagery from any source is similarly fabricated to maintain globe Earth deception. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT SOURCES: Earth images come from: NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CNSA (China), ISRO (India), Roscosmos (Russia), private companies, amateur satellite operators. Would require unprecedented global conspiracy among rivals to all produce consistent "fake" spherical Earth. 2) TECHNICAL VERIFICATION: Professional photographers, imaging scientists, can analyze photos for authenticity. Lighting, shadows, atmospheric effects all consistent with genuine space photography. No evidence of CGI artifacts in properly examined images. 3) YOU CAN VERIFY: High-altitude balloon cameras (anyone can launch) show curved horizon. Amateur astronomers photograph ISS, Moon, planets. Private spaceflight participants have seen Earth. Pilots see curvature at altitude. Independent verification doesn't require trusting NASA. 4) HISTORICAL CONSISTENCY: Earth photos from 1960s Apollo missions, 1970s-2020s satellites, all show consistent spherical Earth. Pre-CGI photographs show same sphere. Would require 60+ years of consistent fakery across multiple technological eras. 5) PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY: Creating fake Earth imagery that perfectly matches: Real-time weather patterns worldwide. Seasonal changes. Day/night patterns. Ship/aircraft positions visible from space. Would be vastly harder than actually photographing real spherical Earth. IRONY OF THIS SPECIFIC IMAGE: Meme uses what appears to be genuine NASA photograph to claim NASA photos are fake. Image shows beautiful, detailed Earth - exactly what you'd expect if Earth is spherical and NASA photographs it. Using real evidence against itself doesn't disprove the evidence. APPEAL OF WORDPLAY FORMAT: 1) SHAREABILITY: Clever twist makes meme memorable and shareable. People share "clever" content more than straightforward claims. 2) HUMOR AS TROJAN HORSE: Joke format sneaks conspiracy claim past critical thinking. Laughing at punchline creates positive association with message. 3) PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY: "It's just a joke" if challenged. Can be passed off as humor rather than serious claim. 4) COMMUNITY BONDING: Inside joke format creates in-group feeling. Those who "get it" feel part of enlightened community. EFFECTIVENESS: Works because: Doesn't require viewer to understand any evidence. Appeals through cleverness rather than logic. Creates emotional response (amusement) that bypasses rational evaluation. Memorable format that stays in mind. Positions flat Earther as witty/intelligent. WEAKNESS: Only persuades those already sympathetic or unfamiliar with evidence. Anyone who knows: Earth photos come from multiple independent sources. Photos can be verified through various methods. Conspiracy of this scale is implausibly large. ...will recognize meme as unsupported assertion wrapped in wordplay. Cleverness of delivery doesn't make underlying claim true. IMAGE SOURCE: Photograph appears to be legitimate NASA Earth image - possibly DSCOVR EPIC, Blue Marble series, or similar. High quality suggests official space agency source. Flat Earth community frequently uses authentic NASA images in propaganda - using real images to claim images aren't real is standard approach. Ironic that evidence of spherical Earth is used to argue against spherical Earth.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-395","title":"Other 395","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12983872_489419371257802_7738578639032275865_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-394","title":"Other 394","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12983414_487024348163971_3915253100816557183_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-396","title":"Other 396","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12984047_491345597731846_543373257235704240_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]

Navigation charts use projections that account for Earth's shape. Time zone changes, day/night patterns, seasonal variations all match spherical Earth predictions. No pilot reports surprise at flight times being wrong - they're calculated accurately using spherical geometry. COCKPIT IMAGE ANALYSIS: What image actually shows: Normal commercial flight operations. Horizon appearing straight (expected - too distant to see curvature clearly). Professional pilots using instruments designed for spherical Earth. Level flight maintained by constant altitude, which automatically follows Earth's curve. Nothing in image contradicts spherical Earth - image shows exactly what you'd expect on spherical Earth. APPEAL OF THIS ARGUMENT: Argument is effective because: Aviation seems technical and authoritative. Most people don't understand flight physics. "Pilots don't adjust for curvature" sounds like damning evidence. Creates impression that spherical Earth should require constant obvious adjustment. Misunderstands how gravity and altitude work together. PILOT RESPONSES: Professional pilots regularly debunk this claim: Explain that level flight by definition follows Earth's curve. Note that navigation software assumes spherical Earth and works perfectly. Point out that flight routes match great circle paths on sphere. Describe how international flights would be impossible if Earth were flat. Flat Earth flight route predictions don't match actual flight times. VISUAL RHETORIC: Cockpit imagery is impressive and technical. Suggests insider/expert knowledge about aviation. Sunset lighting creates beautiful, engaging photograph. Professional pilots visible suggests credibility. Simple text claim allows viewers to accept without questioning. Works if viewer doesn't understand that "maintaining altitude" automatically accounts for curvature.10:[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 395 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming \"Pilots never account for curvature.\" Flat Earth meme using..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 395"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming \"Pilots never account for curvature.\" Flat Earth meme using..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12983872_489419371257802_7738578639032275865_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$16"}],"$L17","$L18","$L19","$L1a","$L1b"]
