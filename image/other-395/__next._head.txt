5:T1c37,Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming "Pilots never account for curvature." Flat Earth meme using aviation imagery to argue pilots don't adjust for Earth's curve during flight, presented as evidence that Earth is flat. IMAGE: Professional photograph taken from inside commercial aircraft cockpit during flight, showing both pilots, instrument panels, and view through windscreen. COCKPIT ENVIRONMENT: Modern commercial aircraft flight deck - appears to be Boeing 777 or similar wide-body aircraft based on instrument layout. Glass cockpit with multiple digital displays (Primary Flight Display, Navigation Display, Engine instruments). Overhead panel visible at top of frame showing numerous switches, buttons, and controls - typical of commercial aircraft systems (hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical, lighting). Green backlighting on overhead panel labels - standard for aircraft instrument lighting. Center pedestal between pilots with throttle quadrant, radio panels, and flight management system controls. PILOTS: Two pilots visible from behind - Captain (left seat) and First Officer (right seat). Both wearing white uniform shirts with epaulettes indicating rank. Seated in flight deck seats with headrests visible. Hands on controls - one pilot's hand visible on control yoke. Professional commercial pilots operating aircraft in cruise flight. VIEW THROUGH WINDSCREEN: High-altitude view showing: Horizon line where sky meets earth/clouds below. Beautiful gradient sky - deep blue at top transitioning to lighter blue, then orange/pink near horizon suggesting sunrise or sunset timing. Cloud layer visible below aircraft altitude. Horizon appears straight/flat across windscreen (expected visual appearance at any altitude - curvature is too gradual to perceive from aircraft windows). Earth's surface or lower clouds visible below with various colors and textures. TEXT OVERLAY: Bottom text (white Impact font): "PILOTS NEVER ACCOUNT FOR CURVATURE" - Makes claim about aviation procedures. "fb.com/fematters" attribution at top. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) NO CURVATURE ADJUSTMENT: Flat Earthers claim pilots don't adjust aircraft pitch/attitude to follow Earth's curve. On spherical Earth, plane would have to constantly nose down to maintain altitude as Earth curves away beneath it. Since pilots don't do this, Earth must be flat. 2) FLAT HORIZON: Horizon visible through cockpit appears flat/straight. If Earth were curved, horizon should appear curved from altitude. Since it looks flat, Earth is flat. 3) PILOT TESTIMONY: Some flat Earthers claim pilots privately admit they don't account for curvature. Training doesn't include curvature corrections. Navigation uses flat maps. If Earth were sphere, aviation would be impossible or radically different. 4) GYROSCOPE ARGUMENT: Aircraft attitude indicators (artificial horizons) are gyroscopic - they maintain orientation in space. If Earth curved, gyroscope would show nose-up attitude change over long flights. Since gyros don't show this, Earth isn't curving. WHY THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG: 1) GRAVITY DOES THE WORK: Aircraft in flight experiences gravity pulling toward Earth's center. "Level flight" means flying perpendicular to gravity - which automatically follows Earth's curve. Pilots don't manually adjust because gravity/physics handle it. It's like asking why you don't "adjust" while walking to keep your feet on the ground - gravity does it automatically. No pilot "accounts for" gravity consciously - they just maintain altitude. 2) WHAT "LEVEL" MEANS: In aviation, "level" means maintaining constant altitude above mean sea level (MSL). Altimeters measure pressure, which changes with altitude. Flying "level" according to altimeter automatically follows Earth's curve. Maintaining 35,000 feet MSL means staying same distance from Earth's surface, which curves. Pilots DO "account for curvature" - it's built into what "level flight" means. 3) ARTIFICIAL HORIZON PHYSICS: Aircraft attitude indicators are gravity-referenced, not space-referenced. They show pitch relative to local gravity vector, not absolute orientation in space. As Earth curves, local "down" direction changes - but this happens to both aircraft AND instrument. Gyros are designed with "erection mechanisms" that align them with local gravity over time. This is deliberate engineering because "level" must mean level relative to Earth, not space. 4) VISIBLE CURVATURE: From commercial aircraft cruise altitude (35,000-45,000 feet), Earth's curvature IS visible but subtle. Field of view through cockpit windows is too narrow to easily perceive curvature. Wide-angle photographs from aircraft DO show slight horizon curve. Curvature becomes obvious at higher altitudes (space, very high altitude aircraft). 5) NAVIGATION PROVES SPHERICAL EARTH: Flight routes calculated using great circle navigation (shortest paths on sphere). Flight times match spherical Earth distances, not flat Earth distances. Transoceanic flights would take dramatically different times on flat vs spherical Earth. GPS navigation works by triangulating from satellites orbiting spherical Earth. All international aviation operates on spherical Earth model because it works. 6) PILOT TRAINING REALITY: Pilots are trained in physics, aerodynamics, navigation - all based on spherical Earth model. Navigation charts use projections that account for Earth's shape. Time zone changes, day/night patterns, seasonal variations all match spherical Earth predictions. No pilot reports surprise at flight times being wrong - they're calculated accurately using spherical geometry. COCKPIT IMAGE ANALYSIS: What image actually shows: Normal commercial flight operations. Horizon appearing straight (expected - too distant to see curvature clearly). Professional pilots using instruments designed for spherical Earth. Level flight maintained by constant altitude, which automatically follows Earth's curve. Nothing in image contradicts spherical Earth - image shows exactly what you'd expect on spherical Earth. APPEAL OF THIS ARGUMENT: Argument is effective because: Aviation seems technical and authoritative. Most people don't understand flight physics. "Pilots don't adjust for curvature" sounds like damning evidence. Creates impression that spherical Earth should require constant obvious adjustment. Misunderstands how gravity and altitude work together. PILOT RESPONSES: Professional pilots regularly debunk this claim: Explain that level flight by definition follows Earth's curve. Note that navigation software assumes spherical Earth and works perfectly. Point out that flight routes match great circle paths on sphere. Describe how international flights would be impossible if Earth were flat. Flat Earth flight route predictions don't match actual flight times. VISUAL RHETORIC: Cockpit imagery is impressive and technical. Suggests insider/expert knowledge about aviation. Sunset lighting creates beautiful, engaging photograph. Professional pilots visible suggests credibility. Simple text claim allows viewers to accept without questioning. Works if viewer doesn't understand that "maintaining altitude" automatically accounts for curvature.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 395 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming \"Pilots never account for curvature.\" Flat Earth meme using..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 395"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Commercial airplane cockpit view at high altitude showing horizon and instrument panels, claiming \"Pilots never account for curvature.\" Flat Earth meme using..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12983872_489419371257802_7738578639032275865_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
