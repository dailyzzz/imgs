5:T91c,Spherical trigonometry calculations chart proving Earth curvature using AutoCAD precision. Complex mathematical infographic calculating hidden heights due to Earth's curvature across various distances. Title at top: 'SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY OF A SPHERE WITH 3959 MILES RADIUS PROVING THERE IS NO 8" PER MILE SQUARED RULE FOR A BALL EARTH (USING AutoCAD 2016 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Header text 'SAR 2/' upper right. Below title shows 'Merriam-Webster Definition: Sphere' with definition text 'A solid that is bounded by a surface consisting of all points at a given distance from a point constituting its center' next to small diagram of sphere labeled 'The Imaginary Ball Earth'. Main left portion displays NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Western Hemisphere with North and South America visible, Pacific Ocean, white clouds, appearing as sphere. Overlaid on Earth image: red horizontal line labeled 'SURFACE LINE 3959 MILES RADIUS' extending across hemisphere, yellow arc labeled '$3959 MILES RADIUS' curving from center, compass rose showing cardinal directions, distance scale showing 0-1000-2000-3000-3959 miles. Right side contains extensive data table with columns labeled 'Distance in Miles', 'By Google's Calculator', 'Sagitta (Hidden Height) (Using AutoCAD)', 'By Trig Formula'. Table lists distances from 1 mile to 3170 miles with corresponding calculations showing hidden height due to curvature. Values progress from tiny amounts (1 mile = 0.67 feet hidden) to massive amounts (3170 miles = 1,286,112.00 feet hidden). Bottom shows Excel formula: 'X=3959*(COS(Sin^-1(L/3959))))' and 'The Trig ©=Sin^-1(L/R) X=R-R(Cos(©))'. Credits 'S. Valente, M. Kahnke, Z. Mrabet, jan/22/2016'. Chart demonstrates rigorous mathematical calculation of Earth's curvature using spherical geometry. Shows that for 3959-mile radius sphere (Earth's mean radius), specific amounts of height become hidden at various distances. For example, at 3 miles = 6 feet hidden, at 100 miles = 6668 feet hidden. Calculations use proper spherical trigonometry rather than simplified '8 inches per mile squared' approximation. The '8 inch rule' is rough estimate only accurate for short distances - actual curvature formula more complex. Chart proves mathematically that if Earth is sphere with ~4000 mile radius, substantial curvature exists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 310 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Spherical trigonometry calculations chart proving Earth curvature using AutoCAD precision.
