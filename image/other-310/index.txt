13:T91c,Spherical trigonometry calculations chart proving Earth curvature using AutoCAD precision. Complex mathematical infographic calculating hidden heights due to Earth's curvature across various distances. Title at top: 'SPHERICAL TRIGONOMETRY OF A SPHERE WITH 3959 MILES RADIUS PROVING THERE IS NO 8" PER MILE SQUARED RULE FOR A BALL EARTH (USING AutoCAD 2016 WITH 15-DIGIT PRECISION)'. Header text 'SAR 2/' upper right. Below title shows 'Merriam-Webster Definition: Sphere' with definition text 'A solid that is bounded by a surface consisting of all points at a given distance from a point constituting its center' next to small diagram of sphere labeled 'The Imaginary Ball Earth'. Main left portion displays NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph showing Western Hemisphere with North and South America visible, Pacific Ocean, white clouds, appearing as sphere. Overlaid on Earth image: red horizontal line labeled 'SURFACE LINE 3959 MILES RADIUS' extending across hemisphere, yellow arc labeled '$3959 MILES RADIUS' curving from center, compass rose showing cardinal directions, distance scale showing 0-1000-2000-3000-3959 miles. Right side contains extensive data table with columns labeled 'Distance in Miles', 'By Google's Calculator', 'Sagitta (Hidden Height) (Using AutoCAD)', 'By Trig Formula'. Table lists distances from 1 mile to 3170 miles with corresponding calculations showing hidden height due to curvature. Values progress from tiny amounts (1 mile = 0.67 feet hidden) to massive amounts (3170 miles = 1,286,112.00 feet hidden). Bottom shows Excel formula: 'X=3959*(COS(Sin^-1(L/3959))))' and 'The Trig ©=Sin^-1(L/R) X=R-R(Cos(©))'. Credits 'S. Valente, M. Kahnke, Z. Mrabet, jan/22/2016'. Chart demonstrates rigorous mathematical calculation of Earth's curvature using spherical geometry. Shows that for 3959-mile radius sphere (Earth's mean radius), specific amounts of height become hidden at various distances. For example, at 3 miles = 6 feet hidden, at 100 miles = 6668 feet hidden. Calculations use proper spherical trigonometry rather than simplified '8 inches per mile squared' approximation. The '8 inch rule' is rough estimate only accurate for short distances - actual curvature formula more complex. Chart proves mathematically that if Earth is sphere with ~4000 mile radius, substantial curvature exists14:T9b2,Antarctic ice shelves collage with 'Why don't we fall off the edge?' question. Four-panel photographic collage showing Antarctic ice formations with flat Earth edge question. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline spans entire width: 'WHY DON'T WE FALL OFF THE EDGE?' Four panels arranged 2x2 grid showing dramatic Antarctic scenery. Top left: Aerial view of red icebreaker ship navigating through broken sea ice and dark blue-black ocean water. Ship appears small against vast seascape with white ice floes scattered across water surface. Gray overcast sky. Top right: Massive tabular iceberg floating in calm ocean - distinctive flat-topped ice formation with vertical white-cream colored walls showing horizontal stratification layers. Iceberg appears house-sized with perfectly vertical cliffs. Deep teal-blue water, lighter blue-gray sky. Bottom left: Enormous ice shelf wall viewed from water level - massive vertical cliff face of pure white glacial ice extending horizontally across frame. Perfectly flat top edge like ruler-straight line against dark gray sky. Vertical striations and texture visible in ice face. Dark navy ocean water at base. Perspective emphasizes scale and geometric flatness of ice shelf edge. Bottom right: Another tabular iceberg with steep vertical walls - irregular angular shape floating in turquoise-blue water. White-cream ice shows layered structure. Lower right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in white text. Collage uses images of Antarctic ice shelves - particularly tabular icebergs and ice shelf edges with their characteristic flat tops and vertical faces - to suggest visual metaphor for 'edge of flat Earth'. Flat-topped icebergs result from ice shelf calving where chunks break off Antarctic ice sheet floating on ocean. Flat tops represent former surface of ice sheet. However, these are simply floating ice formations, not edge of world. Images show Antarctica's coastline where continental ice meets ocean, not planetary boundary. In flat Earth model, Antarctica forms ice wall around perimeter preventing people from reaching edge. However, Antarctica is well-explored continent at Earth's South Pole, circumnavigated many times, with permanent research stations from numerous countries. Ships regularly sail around it. No ice wall exists preventing circumnavigation. Gravity prevents 'falling off' - on sphere, 'down' points toward planetary center from all surface locations, so no edge exists to fall from15:T9fc,Bruce Lee water philosophy meme adapted for flat Earth argument about water taking container shape. Black and white photograph of martial arts legend Bruce Lee with modified version of his famous 'be like water' philosophy applied to flat Earth claims. Top text in large white letters with gray outline: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows professional studio portrait of Bruce Lee - young Asian man with distinctive short dark hair, intense focused gaze, strong features, wearing light colored button-up collared shirt and dark striped tie. High contrast black and white photography creates dramatic effect emphasizing his serious, contemplative expression. Background plain gray. Text overlay on right side in white with gray outline: 'If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.' Line break, then: 'You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. You put water on a ball, it falls off.' Quote modifies Bruce Lee's iconic philosophy from interview/documentary where he described adaptability using water metaphor: 'Be water, my friend.' Original quote explained water's ability to conform to any container, flow around obstacles, crash through barriers - representing martial arts philosophy of adaptation and formlessness. This version adds final line 'You put water on a ball, it falls off' to suggest water cannot conform to spherical surface, therefore Earth cannot be sphere. Classic flat Earth argument about water adhering to curves. However, modification misunderstands both Bruce Lee's philosophy and physics. Water DOES conform to spherical surfaces when gravity acts toward center. On Earth-sized sphere, gravity pulls water molecules toward core creating curved ocean surface that appears locally level. Water in cup/bottle/teapot conforms due to gravity pulling down plus container walls constraining laterally. On sphere, water conforms due to gravity pulling radially inward toward center - no container walls needed. Small amounts of water on basketball-sized ball fall off due to surface tension being too weak to overcome gravity pulling straight down, but on planetary scale, gravity's radial pull toward center keeps oceans attached. Water on Earth curves following spherical surface - demonstrated by ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon. Misappropriating Bruce Lee's philosophy for flat Earth argument contradicts his actual message about adaptation, flexibility, understanding nature's principles9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-310","title":"Other 310","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764408_467334173466322_8797735789174496278_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-309","title":"Other 309","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12747902_467916246741448_492441545354721726_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-311","title":"Other 311","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764808_467925800073826_2315618439056180762_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
