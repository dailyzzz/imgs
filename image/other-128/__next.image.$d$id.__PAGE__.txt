Dark teal or blue-green hardcover book with gold embossed lettering. Title reads 'IS THE BIBLE FROM HEAVEN?' at top. Center shows geometric diagram/symbol resembling flat Earth model or cosmology chart with dome and circular design. Below diagram asks 'IS THE EARTH A GLOBE?' Book appears worn with age, showing vintage binding. Questioning rhetorical titles imply both questions have same answer - suggesting Bible's cosmology describes flat stationary Earth rather than spinning globe. Historical flat Earth literature from religious perspective. Book likely from late 1800s or early 1900s when flat Earth movement had religious following. Argues biblical cosmology contradicts heliocentric globe model, presenting dichotomy between scriptural authority and modern astronomy"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-127","title":"Other 127","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12310715_440635202802886_373327189041559097_n.jpg","description":"Contemplative silhouetted photograph with 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in bold white letters at top. Shows lone person standing on dark rocky coastal outcrop at sunset or sunrise. Person appears as complete silhouette in profile facing right, looking out over ocean. Sky features beautiful gradient transitioning from deep blue at top through lighter blue-purple in middle to warm orange-pink-peach tones near horizon. Scattered wispy clouds visible in upper sky. Ocean water shows subtle wave motion with white foam. Rocky formation in foreground appears dark brown-black, rugged and textured. Horizon line between ocean and sky appears perfectly flat and level, stretching across entire width of image. Composition creates contemplative, philosophical mood suggesting person pondering nature of reality and Earth's true shape. Silhouette format emphasizes universal human search for truth. Peaceful natural setting contrasts with controversial subject matter"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-129","title":"Other 129","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12316390_439178006281939_392989869745422685_n.jpg","description":"Stunning aerial sunset photograph taken from airplane window showing view over engine nacelle/cowling. 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in large bold white letters at top. White curved airplane engine cowling visible in lower left foreground. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level extending across entire width of image where dark ocean or land meets sky. Sky shows spectacular gradient from deep blue-purple at top transitioning through lighter blue in middle to brilliant orange-yellow-red sunset colors at horizon. Thin bright orange-red band marks exact horizon line. Colors create natural ombre effect. Ocean or landscape below appears as dark blue-gray mass. Image taken at high altitude (30,000+ feet). Despite high altitude view, horizon appears completely flat with no visible curvature, which flat Earth proponents use as evidence against spherical Earth. Argues human eye should detect curvature at commercial flight altitudes if Earth were globe. Beautiful natural colors contrast with controversial message"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
