White coffee mug on left, tablet device with 'JM' logo on right. Flat Earth globe icon visible in background. White text reads 'RESEARCH WHAT I POST'. Bottom left shows 'fb.com/fematters' watermark. Encourages independent verification of flat Earth claims rather than blind acceptance, promoting critical thinking and personal research. Contrasts blind faith (top blindfolded figure) with studious investigation (bottom studying figure).

Another man in dark suit visible in background also laughing in elegant restaurant/dining setting with warm lighting and curtains. Bottom text: 'SOMEONE TELLS YOU NASA WENT TO THE MOON'. Watermark 'fb.com/fematters' in bottom left. Classic meme format expressing incredulous disbelief, suggesting moon landing claims are laughably absurd.
