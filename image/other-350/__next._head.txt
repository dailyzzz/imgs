5:T156e,Burj Khalifa curvature comparison meme questioning visibility of Earth's curve at 2,722 feet altitude. Three-panel infographic arguing Earth's curvature should be visible from Burj Khalifa if MythBusters' claims about curvature visibility are accurate. Layout presents evidence comparison suggesting contradiction. Top section split into two side-by-side panels showing airplane window views from high altitude. Left panel: photograph through aircraft window showing airplane wing in lower right corner, horizon line cutting across center, curved Earth horizon visible with thin blue atmospheric band separating Earth's surface from black space above. Overlay text "@67,400 FT" indicates altitude. Right panel: similar airplane window photograph showing wing, horizon with visible curvature, atmospheric glow. Overlay text "@70,000 FT" indicates altitude. Both images show characteristic high-altitude views - dark sky above transitioning through atmospheric gradient to Earth surface below. Curvature appears as gentle arc across horizon. Middle section shows text on light blue background in dark gray/black font: "According to Mythbusters, we should be able to see a curve going up a mere 2500 feet." Word "2500 feet" appears in red for emphasis. Statement references MythBusters TV show episode examining Earth curvature visibility. Bottom section shows large aerial photograph taken from extreme height looking down at urban/suburban landscape. Image displays bird's-eye view of developed area with buildings, roads, infrastructure creating geometric patterns. Straight red line drawn horizontally across image at midpoint representing horizon line or reference level. Perspective shows landscape extending to horizon in all directions. Text overlay at bottom in white letters: "This photo is from the top of the Burj Khalifa." Second line: "It measures 2722 feet high." emphasizing altitude. Number "2722" appears in red matching emphasis color. Third line poses rhetorical question: "Where's the curvature?" - suggesting curvature should be visible but isn't. Lower left shows "fb.com/oierreeplana" attribution. Burj Khalifa in Dubai is world's tallest building at 2,722 feet (829.8 meters) to architectural top. Meme's argument: MythBusters claimed curvature visible at 2,500 feet altitude, Burj Khalifa exceeds that at 2,722 feet, yet photograph from top shows flat horizon, therefore either MythBusters wrong or Earth is flat. However, argument contains fundamental misunderstanding of scale and geometry. Scientific reality: Earth's curvature at 2,500-2,700 feet altitude is geometrically minuscule - horizon drops approximately 0.5 degrees over visible distance. At this altitude, observer's horizon extends roughly 64 miles, and Earth's curvature over that distance creates drop of approximately 2,700 feet (equal to observer altitude) - but this is spread across 64-mile circle, creating extremely gentle arc imperceptible to human eye as distinct curve. Visible "horizon line" appears straight because field of view captures small arc segment. MythBusters episode (if accurately referenced) likely discussed curvature becoming theoretically measurable at certain altitudes with precise instruments, not necessarily visible to naked eye as obvious curve. Human eye perception of curvature requires either: 1) Very wide field of view capturing significant arc portion (fish-eye lens effect), 2) Higher altitude where arc becomes more pronounced (typically 35,000+ feet for subtle perception, 60,000+ feet for clear perception). Airplane window photos at 67,000-70,000 feet show curvature because altitude is 25-30x higher than Burj Khalifa, greatly increasing visible arc. Additionally, those photos may use wide-angle lenses naturally showing more curvature. Calculation: At 2,722 feet altitude, horizon distance = √(2 × radius × height) = √(2 × 3,959 miles × 0.515 miles) = √4,077 = 64 miles. Over 64-mile radius circle, Earth curves such that far side of visible circle is ~2,722 feet lower than observer (equal to altitude), but this creates gentle arc not straight drop. Angular subtense of this curvature across observer's field of view (typically 60-90 degrees) is fraction of degree - below threshold for perception as curved line versus straight line. Red line drawn across bottom photograph is itself suspicious - appears to be added digitally to emphasize "straight" horizon, but such lines can create illusion of flatness even on gently curved surface by averaging across arc. Meme selectively compares incomparable conditions: ultra-high altitude airplane views showing curvature to much lower building view where curvature is geometrically negligible. This is false equivalency fallacy. Proper comparison would be: Burj Khalifa view vs airplane at equivalent 2,700 feet altitude (also showing apparently flat horizon), or high-altitude airplane vs spacecraft at similar altitude both showing curvature. MythBusters reference may be misquoted or taken out of context. Show known for rigorous testing and explaining scientific principles accurately. If they discussed 2,500 feet, likely referred to theoretical measurability with instruments, not obvious visibility. Meme's rhetorical strategy exploits scale misunderstanding to create apparent contradiction where none exists. Effective propaganda because requires understanding of geometry, perspective, and scale to debunk - casual viewer sees "simple" contradiction suggesting conspiracy or error.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 350 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Burj Khalifa curvature comparison meme questioning visibility of Earth's curve at 2,722 feet altitude.
