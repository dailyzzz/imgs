5:T894,The Seven Luminaries flat Earth cosmology diagram. Artistic illustration showing flat Earth model with seven celestial bodies labeled as 'luminaries'. Black background with dark gray double-border frame. Upper portion shows circular flat Earth disc viewed from above - blue oceans surrounding green continents arranged around central white Arctic/North Pole. North America visible on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia top and left, Australia lower left. Outer ring shows thick white/gray ice barrier representing Antarctica. Central area displays photorealistic continents with natural coloring. Below Earth disc arranged in two rows: planetary bodies shown as spheres with labels. Top row left to right: Mars (small reddish-orange sphere labeled 'MARS'), Venus (pale cream sphere labeled 'VENUS'), Jupiter (large tan sphere with bands labeled 'JUPITER'), Mercury (small gray-tan sphere labeled 'MERCURY'), Saturn (pale yellow sphere with distinctive ring system labeled 'SATURN'). Bottom row: Sun (bright orange-yellow glowing sphere labeled 'SUN'), white triangular mountain peak (labeled 'HOLY MOUNTAIN'), Moon (gray cratered sphere labeled 'MOON'). Holy Mountain positioned centrally between sun and moon. All celestial objects rendered with realistic textures - Mars shows red surface, Jupiter shows swirling bands, Saturn's rings detailed, Moon shows craters, Sun has glowing corona effect. Bottom text in italics: 'THE 7 LUMINARIES'. Diagram represents esoteric flat Earth cosmology combining seven classical 'wandering stars' (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) with biblical/ancient cosmology. In ancient astronomy, these seven celestial bodies were 'luminaries' or 'wanderers' distinguishable from fixed stars. Inclusion of 'Holy Mountain' references various mythological cosmologies placing sacred mountain at world's center (Mount Meru in Hindu/Buddhist, Mount Olympus in Greek, Zion in Abrahamic traditions). However, modern astronomy understands Sun as star, Moon as natural satellite, five planets as worlds orbiting Sun. Saturn's rings, Jupiter's atmospheric bands, Mars' surface features all extensively documented by spacecraft0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 293 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"The Seven Luminaries flat Earth cosmology diagram.
