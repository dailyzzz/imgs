13:T894,The Seven Luminaries flat Earth cosmology diagram. Artistic illustration showing flat Earth model with seven celestial bodies labeled as 'luminaries'. Black background with dark gray double-border frame. Upper portion shows circular flat Earth disc viewed from above - blue oceans surrounding green continents arranged around central white Arctic/North Pole. North America visible on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia top and left, Australia lower left. Outer ring shows thick white/gray ice barrier representing Antarctica. Central area displays photorealistic continents with natural coloring. Below Earth disc arranged in two rows: planetary bodies shown as spheres with labels. Top row left to right: Mars (small reddish-orange sphere labeled 'MARS'), Venus (pale cream sphere labeled 'VENUS'), Jupiter (large tan sphere with bands labeled 'JUPITER'), Mercury (small gray-tan sphere labeled 'MERCURY'), Saturn (pale yellow sphere with distinctive ring system labeled 'SATURN'). Bottom row: Sun (bright orange-yellow glowing sphere labeled 'SUN'), white triangular mountain peak (labeled 'HOLY MOUNTAIN'), Moon (gray cratered sphere labeled 'MOON'). Holy Mountain positioned centrally between sun and moon. All celestial objects rendered with realistic textures - Mars shows red surface, Jupiter shows swirling bands, Saturn's rings detailed, Moon shows craters, Sun has glowing corona effect. Bottom text in italics: 'THE 7 LUMINARIES'. Diagram represents esoteric flat Earth cosmology combining seven classical 'wandering stars' (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) with biblical/ancient cosmology. In ancient astronomy, these seven celestial bodies were 'luminaries' or 'wanderers' distinguishable from fixed stars. Inclusion of 'Holy Mountain' references various mythological cosmologies placing sacred mountain at world's center (Mount Meru in Hindu/Buddhist, Mount Olympus in Greek, Zion in Abrahamic traditions). However, modern astronomy understands Sun as star, Moon as natural satellite, five planets as worlds orbiting Sun. Saturn's rings, Jupiter's atmospheric bands, Mars' surface features all extensively documented by spacecraft14:T8b1,Water level collage demonstrating flat horizon argument across multiple scenarios. Six-panel photographic collage showing water surfaces appearing level/flat. Top left: Tropical beach with turquoise Caribbean-blue shallow water, white sandy bottom visible through clear water, horizon line appears perfectly straight across distance where water meets sky. Light blue sky with slight clouds. Top center: Straight country road stretching into distance with green fields on sides, gray asphalt, blue sky with white clouds, power lines visible. Rural landscape. Top right: Canal or waterway with dark still water reflecting sky, straight towpath along right side, brick building visible on right, trees and vegetation, overcast sky. Surface appears perfectly flat and mirror-like. Center: Diagram showing water level demonstration with connected vessels - scientific illustration with four glass tubes/cylinders of different heights connected at bottom by clear tube creating U-shape or connected vessel system. Blue water fills tubes to same level across all containers (labeled with measurements: 1 ft, 2 ft, 3 ft, 4 ft markers) demonstrating principle that water finds same level in connected containers regardless of vessel height. Water colored blue for visibility. Bottom left: Aerial/satellite view of coastline showing tan/beige land meeting bright turquoise shallow water, deeper blue-black ocean beyond, white sandy beach or sediment visible. Shows large scale where water surface appears flat. Bottom right: Aerial view of meandering river or waterway creating S-curves through dark landscape, water appears silver-gray reflecting sky, shows natural water flow patterns. Red horizontal line drawn across top of image spanning entire width suggesting level measurement or horizon reference. Collage argues water always finds level, never curves - therefore large bodies of water prove flat Earth. Classic flat Earth claim. However, 'level' means perpendicular to gravity direction, which points toward Earth's center. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface - creates curved surface globally while appearing flat locally. Water DOES curve with Earth - ships disappear hull-first over horizon15:T80a,Pool balls on felt table sarcastic sphere logic meme. Satirical photograph mocking flawed reasoning about spheres and surfaces. Top text in large bold white letters: 'THESE POOL BALLS ARE SPHERES'. Image shows pool/billiards table with bright turquoise-blue felt surface. Cluster of standard pool balls (numbered 1-15) arranged in breaking formation - triangular rack pattern with balls touching. Balls show various solid and striped colors: white cue ball separate at left, yellow (1), blue (2), red (3), purple (4), orange (5), green (6), maroon/burgundy (7), black (8), yellow striped (9), blue striped (10), red striped (11), purple striped (12), orange striped (13), green striped (14), maroon striped (15). Balls highly polished with visible reflections and highlights showing spherical shape. Wooden cue stick visible at top right edge with brass ferrule and white tip. Lower right shows 'Flat Earth Matters' attribution in white text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'THIS TABLE MUST BE A SPHERE TOO'. Meme sarcastically mocks logical fallacy in flat Earth arguments. Format follows reductio ad absurdum - if pool balls being spheres means table must be spherical, then absurd conclusion reveals flawed logic. Parodies flat Earth reasoning patterns that make non-sequitur connections. However, meme actually strawmans globe Earth position - nobody claims Earth is sphere BECAUSE objects on it are spherical. Earth's sphericity determined by: measurements of curvature (ships disappearing hull-first), circumnavigation, satellite imagery, varying star visibility with latitude, Foucault pendulum, Eratosthenes' shadow measurements (240 BC), lunar eclipse shadows showing round Earth, physics of planetary formation (gravity pulls matter into spheres above certain mass). Objects' shapes don't determine surface shape - spherical objects rest on flat tables, flat papers rest on spherical Earth. Both work fine. Meme creates false equivalence between scale (small objects vs 12,742 km diameter planet) and misrepresents scientific reasoning9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-293","title":"Other 293","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742666_464902050376201_1952265792957127379_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-292","title":"Other 292","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742578_464246053775134_5958850086261502289_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-294","title":"Other 294","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742737_468137263386013_8988751100282107941_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
