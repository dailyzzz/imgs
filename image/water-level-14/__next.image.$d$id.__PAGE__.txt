3:T40a,Dramatic sunset meme showing water wave with sun reflection. Left side displays ocean wave with water droplets splashing upward, creating curved water surface. Sunset visible in background with golden sun low on horizon creating golden-orange reflection path across water. Sky shows orange and dark blue gradient. Large white text at top reads 'WHEN WATER CURVES' and bottom text states 'SO DOES THE SUNS REFLECTION'. Watermark 'mematic.net' at bottom right. Argues that when water surface curves (as in wave), sun's reflection follows that curve, creating distorted reflection path. Implies that if oceans curved over spherical Earth, sun reflections should appear distorted or impossible, but straight reflection paths observed suggest flat water surfaces. Uses wave photography to demonstrate principle that water's shape determines reflection geometry, questioning why ocean reflections appear straight if water curves over globe. Presents observable optics of curved water surfaces as evidence against large-scale ocean curvature4:T428,Three-panel soccer ball meme demonstrating water retention on different surfaces. Top panel shows inflated white soccer ball with classic black pentagon pattern on grass, labeled 'BALL DOESN'T HOLD WATER'. Middle panel shows same ball completely deflated and collapsed inward, wrinkled white leather with black patches visible, labeled 'BUT A FLAT BALL DOES'. Bottom panel shows completely flattened deflated ball pressed flat on dark surface, black panels spread out in irregular pattern. Humorous analogy arguing that spherical surfaces don't retain water (water runs off curved ball), but flat surfaces do hold water (deflated flat ball could theoretically hold water like shallow dish). Applies this observation to Earth: if Earth were spherical like inflated ball, oceans should run off curved surface, but since water stays in place, Earth must be flat like deflated ball. Uses everyday object (soccer ball) to make intuitive argument about water behavior on curved versus flat surfaces, suggesting flat Earth better explains water retention than globe model5:T45b,Stunning photograph of Bolivian Salt Flats (Salar de Uyuni) with header 'THE BOLIVIAN SALT FLATS'. Shows perfectly still water creating flawless mirror reflection of dramatic sunset sky. Sky displays layers of golden-orange, pink, and blue clouds illuminated by setting sun on horizon. Water surface appears as perfect mirror, reflecting entire sky scene with such clarity that horizon line between sky and reflection is barely distinguishable. Creates symmetrical composition where top half (actual sky) mirrors bottom half (water reflection) almost identically. Silhouette of dark landmass visible on horizon line. Bottom text states '4,086 square miles of flat water...a giant mirror reflecting the sky above. Only possible on a flat earth!' Black borders frame image. Argues that Salar de Uyuni's vast flat expanse (world's largest salt flat) creating perfect mirror reflections during rainy season demonstrates water's natural tendency to be flat/level. Claims such perfect large-scale reflections are only possible on flat surface, questioning how curved water surface could create such precise mirror effects0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-14","title":"Water Level 14","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/31779510_384281155407109_2444981764712562688_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-13","title":"Water Level 13","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/30582401_10213503635522657_7296528551136722944_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-15","title":"Water Level 15","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/36317967_10212146638813812_1886059361038499840_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
