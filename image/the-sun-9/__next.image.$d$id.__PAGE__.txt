Top row shows three images of coin on flat surface: close-up showing full circular coin (labeled '1'), medium distance showing coin appearing partially below surface edge (labeled '2'), far distance showing only top edge visible (labeled '3'). Bottom row shows three corresponding sunset photographs over water horizon: sun fully above horizon (labeled '4'), sun partially below horizon (labeled '5'), sun barely visible as sliver at horizon (labeled '6'). Bottom text reads 'THE SUN IS NOT GOING DOWN, IT IS ONLY GOING AWAY FROM YOU!' Presents perspective explanation for sunset: sun appears to descend below horizon not due to Earth's rotation but because object moving away on flat plane appears to lower and eventually disappear at vanishing point, comparing sunset to coin demonstration where distance creates appearance of descent"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-8","title":"The Sun 8","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/17190815_10208384304754946_3610927991549212014_n.jpeg","description":"Flat Earth diagram showing 'PATH of the SUN' with circular orbital pattern above flat Earth disc. Shows sun moving in concentric circular paths over flat plane, marked with 'Tropic of Cancer 23.5°N' and 'Tropic of Capricorn 23.5°S' as circles. Center marked 'North Pole' with outer ring 'ICE WALL'. Diagram indicates 'Summer in the North' with sun in outer orbit and 'Winter in the North' with sun in tighter inner circle. Labels show '24hr Daylight' and '24hr Darkness' zones. Illustrates flat Earth model of sun's annual movement creating seasons through changing circular orbit radius rather than axial tilt, with sun remaining local and close to Earth surface, circling above flat plane between tropics throughout year"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-10","title":"The Sun 10","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/18839133_10211832602962117_6547347150306283342_n.jpeg","description":"Meme titled 'HELIOCENTRIC CONTRADICTIONS' with black text on white background listing perceived inconsistencies: 'If we are enclosed in a vacuum...' followed by bullet points: '1. Why doesn't the atmosphere get sucked into it?' '2. Why don't satellites or the ISS get sucked in?' '3. Why do you say wind is caused by air pressure? Especially if space is a vacuum?' '4. If you are already in a vacuum, why do you need to escape it?' '5. When you're already supposed to be in space?' '6. Why isn't a level, level?' Questions mainstream astronomy model regarding atmosphere retention in vacuum of space, satellite mechanics, atmospheric pressure physics, and concept of escaping atmosphere when space is already vacuum. Conflates multiple scientific concepts: atmospheric retention via gravity, pressure gradients, orbital mechanics, and definition of 'space' boundary"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
