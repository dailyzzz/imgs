3:T5b9,NASA astronaut requirements satirical checklist with spacewalk background. Shows astronaut in white EVA spacesuit performing spacewalk in low Earth orbit. Astronaut's helmet reflects bright sunlight, shows gold-tinted visor, white PLSS (Portable Life Support System) backpack visible. Background shows stunning Earth view from space - curved blue planet with white cloud swirls, turquoise-blue oceans visible. Atmosphere limb glows bright blue at horizon. Dark space visible at top. Upper right shows official NASA logo (blue circle with red chevron, white letters). Foreground displays satirical document titled 'NASA Astronaut Requirements' with three items checked with blue checkmarks: 'Bachelor's degree in a Scuba diving', '33rd degree Freemason', 'Ability to lie'. Upper left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right displays 'JM' signature watermark. Satire suggests NASA astronauts are selected for conspiracy participation rather than scientific credentials. Bachelor's degree in scuba diving mocks underwater training in Neutral Buoyancy Lab where astronauts practice EVA procedures - conspiracy theorists claim spacewalk footage is filmed underwater. 33rd degree Freemason reference suggests occult secret society controls space program. Multiple astronauts have been Freemasons including Buzz Aldrin. 'Ability to lie' explicitly states astronauts are actors perpetuating hoax. Discredits astronaut testimony and space program achievements4:T59f,Dramatic ocean sunset with crepuscular rays and Leonardo da Vinci perception quote. Shows stunning natural seascape photograph at sunset or sunrise. Sky dominates upper two-thirds with dramatic cloud formations - thick gray-purple storm clouds mixed with golden-orange illuminated clouds. Sun breaking through clouds creates spectacular crepuscular rays (sun rays/god rays) - multiple distinct beams of light radiating downward and outward from cloud gap, appearing to converge at single point above horizon. Rays show various angles spreading across sky like fan. Light creates golden-orange glow on water surface where rays strike ocean. Lower portion shows dark silhouetted ocean water in deep blue-black with golden reflection path from sun. Very bottom edge shows black silhouettes of land, vegetation, or trees. Top text in white reads: 'There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown, those who do not see.' Attribution below: '- Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Crepuscular rays used as evidence for local close sun rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Flat Earth argument claims if sun were truly distant, rays should be parallel not convergent. Perspective effect causes parallel rays to appear to converge at vanishing point, same as railroad tracks. Quote implies flat Earthers are 'those who see' truth directly through observation5:T5ce,Dramatic Antarctic ice shelf wall meeting ocean from aerial perspective. Shows breathtaking aerial photograph of Antarctic ice formation from elevated viewpoint looking along ice edge. Massive tabular ice shelf dominates right side and background - perfectly flat white-gray ice surface extending to horizon creating geometric plane. Ice shows subtle surface variations, crevasses, and textural details. Most striking feature is sheer vertical ice cliff or wall where shelf meets water - clean straight edge running diagonally across image from upper left toward lower right. Ice wall appears 50-100+ feet tall with nearly vertical face showing stratified layers of compressed ice and snow in white and blue-gray bands. Face shows some irregularities, overhangs, and ice chunks that have calved off. Left side shows dark navy-blue to black ocean water with scattered ice fragments, brash ice, small icebergs floating on surface. Two small turquoise-blue ice chunks or small bergs visible in lower left. Water appears very dark creating dramatic contrast with bright white ice. Sky shows overcast gray-white conditions typical of Antarctic weather. Horizon line in far distance. No text or watermarks visible. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual representation of 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing ocean water from spilling off edges and restricting access to whatever lies beyond Antarctic perimeter0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-233","title":"Other 233","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669451_460535570812849_7178703130652227552_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-232","title":"Other 232","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662673_466884456844627_7673106619158676577_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-234","title":"Other 234","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669527_461770220689384_4205422869487854845_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
