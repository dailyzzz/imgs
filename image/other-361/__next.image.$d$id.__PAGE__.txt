3:T16fe,Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet using ironic wordplay "around the globe" about flat Earth movement. Screenshot of authentic Twitter post from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson making witty observation about flat Earth movement's growth. Image shows standard Twitter interface with white background. Top left displays Tyson's profile photo - headshot showing him in dark suit with characteristic mustache and goatee, friendly expression. Next to photo shows verified Twitter account information: "Neil deGrasse Tyson" in bold black text with blue checkmark verification badge indicating authentic account. Below name shows Twitter handle "@neiltyson" in gray text. Tweet body contains single sentence in standard Twitter font (black text on white background): "I hear that the flat-Earth movement may be gaining momentum all around the globe." Tweet intentionally uses phrase "around the globe" when discussing flat Earth movement - creates ironic wordplay since flat Earth believers claim Earth is not globe. Humor lies in contradiction: if discussing flat Earth movement, why use globe terminology? Either slip revealing Tyson's globe Earth assumption, or deliberate joke poking fun at movement. Timestamp below tweet shows "10:44 AM - 8 Mar 2016" in gray text indicating when tweet was posted. Engagement metrics displayed below in gray and black text: "10,027 RETWEETS" and "23,881 LIKES" showing tweet's popularity and viral spread. Top right shows Twitter bird logo with plus sign for following/interaction. Bottom right displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution in black text on white background, indicating screenshot shared in flat Earth community. Tweet operates on multiple levels: 1) WORDPLAY: "Around the globe" is common English idiom meaning "worldwide" or "everywhere," but literal meaning references spherical Earth. Using this phrase when discussing flat Earth movement creates humorous contradiction. 2) TYSON'S INTENT: Tweet likely intended as gentle mockery - Tyson using globe terminology sarcastically implies flat Earth believers are spreading movement across spherical Earth without realizing irony. Shows Tyson's dismissive attitude toward flat Earth claims through subtle humor rather than direct confrontation. 3) SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Tyson is prominent science communicator, astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of Cosmos reboot. He frequently addresses pseudoscience and scientific misconceptions. Flat Earth movement began gaining internet visibility around 2014-2016 through YouTube videos, social media, leading to Tyson's 2016 observation about movement's growth. 4) "GAINING MOMENTUM": Physics pun - momentum is physics term (mass × velocity), fitting for physicist discussing movement. Also means "gaining traction" or "growing in popularity." Double meaning adds layer to wordplay. Flat Earth community's reaction to tweet likely mixed: Some might appreciate being acknowledged by prominent scientist (any attention is validation). Others might cite it as evidence establishment feels threatened by flat Earth truth spreading. Screenshot shared in flat Earth communities (fb.com/fematters attribution) suggests tweet used as evidence movement is significant enough to warrant mainstream science's attention. However, Tyson's tone is clearly mocking rather than legitimizing. Tweet reflects 2016 moment when flat Earth experienced resurgence via social media after being dormant for decades. Modern flat Earth movement primarily online phenomenon, using YouTube, Facebook, Twitter to spread despite contradicting centuries of established science. Movement gained enough visibility that prominent scientists felt compelled to address it, though usually dismissively. Irony of wordplay works because "around the globe" is so embedded in common speech that even when discussing alternative Earth shapes, globe terminology naturally emerges. This linguistic habit reflects how thoroughly spherical Earth understanding is integrated into human culture and language - countless idioms, phrases, concepts built on sphericity assumption. Scientific evidence for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different star constellations visible from different hemispheres, time zones, seasons from axial tilt, Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect, satellite imagery from multiple nations, circumnavigation, GPS systems requiring orbital mechanics, lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, measurements by ancient Greeks (Eratosthenes calculating circumference 240 BCE). Tweet became popular in both mainstream and flat Earth communities - mainstream appreciates clever wordplay and Tyson's wit, flat Earth community uses it as evidence their movement is growing and gaining establishment attention. Screenshot format allows viral spread beyond Twitter, appearing on Facebook, forums, memes. Tweet exemplifies science communication challenge: how to address pseudoscience without amplifying it. Tyson chose humor/mockery approach rather than detailed rebuttal. However, research shows mockery can backfire by creating persecution complex in believers, reinforcing sense they're brave truth-seekers against hostile establishment. Alternative interpretation: Tweet could be read as Tyson acknowledging flat Earth is spreading worldwide (unintentionally giving movement credibility), but wordplay suggests dismissive rather than concerned tone. Context of Tyson's other work (numerous talks, tweets, videos defending spherical Earth, explaining basic astronomy) makes clear his position: Earth is spherical, flat Earth belief represents scientific illiteracy, movement's growth is concerning but ultimately contradicts overwhelming evidence. Tweet received significant engagement (10k retweets, 23k likes) showing topic's viral potential and public interest in flat Earth controversy as curiosity/entertainment rather than serious debate.4:T1838,Upside-down tourist at South Pole sign sarcastically asking about gravity. Humorous photograph showing person in inverted orientation next to South Pole marker with sarcastic text questioning gravity concept. Image deliberately rotated 180 degrees to make person appear upside-down, creating visual joke about gravity's effect (or lack thereof) at bottom of Earth. Main subject shows tourist/visitor in winter expedition clothing standing (appearing to stand upside-down from viewer's perspective) next to ceremonial South Pole marker sign at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica. Person wears heavy olive/green insulated parka or winter jacket suitable for extreme Antarctic cold, hood up or off, dark pants or snow pants, winter boots. Person's body orientation upside-down in frame - head at bottom, feet at top - standing on sky as if defying gravity. Person appears to be posing for photograph with arms visible, possibly in casual stance. Face visible showing tourist enjoying moment at South Pole. Prominent blue sign in image shows official Amundsen-Scott South Pole marker (ceremonial pole, not geographic pole marker). Sign is rectangular blue placard with white/silver text and official NSF (National Science Foundation) logo with gear symbol. Text on sign reads "The U.S. National Science Foundation welcomes you to Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station" followed by additional text showing coordinates and "established 1957" or similar historical information. Sign positioned vertically (but appears horizontal due to 180-degree rotation). Geographic South Pole (90°00' South latitude) marked at this research station. Background shows Antarctic environment - distinctive sky typical of polar region showing high thin clouds (cirrus or contrails) creating wispy patterns across pale blue sky. Sky takes up significant portion of frame due to image rotation - what would normally be ground now appears as sky at top. Actual ground surface (appearing at top of rotated image due to inversion) shows white snow/ice characteristic of Antarctic plateau. Some structures barely visible in far background - likely buildings of Amundsen-Scott Station including modular research facilities, fuel tanks, equipment. Station located at geographic South Pole on Antarctic plateau at elevation of approximately 9,300 feet, sitting on ~9,000 feet of ice over land. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF" setting up sarcastic question. Bottom text in enormous bold white letters with black outline: "GRAVITY?" completing phrase with emphasized word. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution. Humor/sarcasm operates on multiple levels: 1) Image mockingly references flat Earth argument that people in Southern Hemisphere, especially Antarctica, would be "upside down" on globe Earth and would fall off due to gravity pulling "down" (toward viewer's perspective). By rotating image 180 degrees so person appears upside-down, meme creates visual representation of "upside-down Australians" argument. 2) "Haven't you heard of gravity?" is sarcastic response to flat Earth claims. From mainstream science perspective, line mocks flat Earthers for not understanding gravity - gravity pulls toward Earth's center from all directions, so no one is actually "upside down." Everyone stands on ground with gravity pulling feet down, regardless of latitude. From flat Earth perspective, line could mock mainstream believers - sarcastically suggesting gravity explanation is absurd patch applied to cover problems with globe model. 3) Image deliberately creates impossible scenario (person standing inverted on sky) to visualize flat Earth concern about Southern Hemisphere. On actual globe Earth, person at South Pole stands normally with gravity pulling toward Earth's center beneath feet. "Down" is defined by gravity, not by external reference frame. Photo manipulation emphasizes absurdity of "upside down" concern. 4) South Pole location is particularly relevant - on globe, South Pole is antipodal to North Pole, representing "bottom" of Earth in common visualization. Flat Earth models typically place North Pole at center of disc and Antarctica as ice wall around perimeter, completely different arrangement. By showing South Pole, image addresses central difference between models. In reality, person photographed stood normally on Antarctic ice with gravity pulling toward Earth's center beneath feet, same sensation as standing anywhere else. Image was rotated in post-processing to create upside-down effect. Actual sensation of standing at South Pole is normal - no sense of being inverted, tilted, or defying gravity. This is because gravity defines local vertical at every location. Scientific explanation: Gravity is force of attraction between masses. Earth's mass creates gravitational field pointing toward its center. At every point on Earth's surface, gravity pulls objects toward center, defining "down." Observers at all locations feel gravity pulling them toward ground beneath feet. There is no absolute "up" or "down" in space - only directions relative to massive bodies. On spherical Earth, "down" varies with position (points toward center), but local experience is consistent everywhere. Flat Earth models typically struggle to explain: 1) Why gravity would pull uniformly "down" through flat plane rather than toward geometric center, 2) How gravity could create consistent pull on infinite plane, 3) Why Southern Hemisphere observations match antipodal relationship predicted by globe (stars, seasons, flight times, sun angles). Meme's effectiveness comes from visual humor - rotated photo creates immediately absurd-looking scenario (person standing on sky) that requires explanation. Whether viewed as mocking flat Earth or mocking globe believers, image generates engagement and discussion about gravity's nature. Irony: photograph taken at real South Pole research station confirms Antarctica is accessible continent with permanent science presence - contradicting flat Earth claims that Antarctica is forbidden ice wall that can't be explored or is patrolled by military to prevent people from reaching edge.5:T19de,Satirical fake CNN news broadcast claiming NASA discovered Earth's curvature on Mars. Photoshopped parody image mocking search for curvature on wrong planet while claiming Earth is flat. Image designed as fake breaking news broadcast screenshot in style of CNN. Background shows Mars surface photograph - reddish-orange rocky terrain characteristic of Martian landscape. Ground shows rust-colored regolith (dust/rock), scattered rocks and boulders creating rough terrain, distant hills or elevated features creating Martian topography. Lighting suggests Martian sunlight (slightly different color temperature than Earth due to thinner atmosphere, distance from sun). Sky shows peachy-orange glow typical of Mars atmosphere (thin CO2 atmosphere creates different sky color than Earth's blue). Digitally composited onto Mars landscape are two spherical Earth images showing classic "Blue Marble" style views - blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents. Larger Earth sphere positioned prominently in center showing full disk, smaller Earth sphere in upper left connected to larger one by curved red line suggesting magnification or zoom-in relationship (like "this is enlarged view of that"). Both Earth images appear as if photographed from space showing spherical planet. Earth's presence on Mars surface is obviously impossible composite - joke's central visual element. Lower portion shows multiple overlaid text banners in CNN broadcast style. Top banner: Red background with white text "BREAKING NEWS" in all caps - CNN's standard urgent news graphic format. Middle banner: White background with black text in large bold letters "NASA FINDS EARTH'S CURVATURE ON MARS" - headline parodying news format while making absurd claim. CNN logo appears on right side showing "CNN" in white letters on red square background. Right of banner shows initials "JM" possibly indicating image creator. Below that: Black banner with white text "NEW HOPE FOR GLOBE ON MARS" - secondary headline continuing joke that curvature exists but on wrong planet. Bottom banner: Black background with white text showing fake CNN quote: "WE THOUGHT WE'D NEVER FIND IT," SAYS NASA - fabricated quote suggesting NASA searched for Earth's curvature unsuccessfully on Earth but finally found it on Mars. Lower left shows "CNN.com" branding. Top left displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution indicating image circulated in flat Earth communities. Satire operates on multiple levels: 1) ABSURDIST HUMOR: Premise is deliberately ridiculous - searching for Earth's curvature on Mars (different planet) while standing on Earth. Parodies flat Earth argument that Earth curvature can't be found/observed, by suggesting it was on Mars all along. 2) MOCKING FLAT EARTHERS: From mainstream perspective, image mocks flat Earth believers for claiming Earth curvature doesn't exist when it's observable from Earth's surface (ships over horizon, high altitude views, different stars at different latitudes). Joke suggests flat Earthers look everywhere except at actual evidence in front of them. 3) ALTERNATIVE READING: From flat Earth perspective, could be read as mocking NASA/mainstream science for showing curved Earth images allegedly from space but never showing curvature from ground level on Earth itself. Suggests curvature only appears in NASA's Mars photos (and Earth photos from space) but not observable in reality. 4) "BREAKING NEWS" PARODY: Format parodies 24-hour news cycle's breathless coverage of minor stories. CNN's "breaking news" banner appears so frequently it's become subject of mockery. Using dramatic "breaking news" format for absurd non-story emphasizes ridiculousness. 5) QUOTE PARODY: Fake NASA quote "We thought we'd never find it" suggests organization desperately searching for proof of curvature, failing to find it on Earth (from flat Earth perspective - admitting curvature doesn't exist on Earth), but eventually finding it on Mars (wrong planet). However, curvature is easily observable on Earth: Ships disappear hull-first over ocean horizon (visible with binoculars from beach), horizon distance increases with observer altitude (calculate: distance = √(2 × Earth radius × height)), different star constellations visible from different latitudes (Southern Cross visible in Southern Hemisphere, Polaris visible in Northern Hemisphere), time zones result from spherical rotation, seasons result from axial tilt of sphere, Foucault pendulum demonstrates rotation, Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns. High-altitude observations show curvature: Commercial aircraft at 35,000+ feet show subtle horizon curve, high-altitude balloons at 100,000+ feet show pronounced curvature, Felix Baumgartner's 2012 Red Bull Stratos jump from 128,000 feet showed clear curvature, astronauts on ISS see obvious curvature from 250-mile altitude. Mars observations actually confirm spherical planets: Mars rovers photograph Martian horizon showing curve consistent with 2,106-mile radius sphere, Mars orbiters show planet is spherical like Earth, Phobos and Deimos (Mars moons) are visible from Mars surface behaving according to spherical planet orbital mechanics. Image's effectiveness as satire depends on viewer: Mainstream viewers see absurdist humor mocking flat Earth's denial of obvious evidence. Flat Earth believers might interpret as mocking NASA's reliance on space imagery while claiming ground observations show flatness. Photoshop quality is intentional parody - CNN broadcast graphics combined with Mars rover imagery and Earth photos creates obviously fake composite. Not attempting to deceive but rather create humorous mashup commenting on flat Earth debate. CNN logo usage is parody/satire (fair use) not actual CNN broadcast. Format became popular meme template for creating fake news screenshots on various topics. This specific version circulated in flat Earth communities as both self-deprecating humor and critique of mainstream science. Context: Mars has been subject of flat Earth speculation - some flat Earthers question whether Mars missions are real or filmed on Earth (Devon Island, Canada often cited as fake Mars location). Others accept Mars exists but debate its nature/distance. Image plays on these debates while highlighting central contradiction: if Earth photos from space show curve, why doesn't Mars? Answer: both planets are spherical, observable from space and detectable from surface observations. Satire highlights flat Earth movement's selective acceptance of evidence - accepting Mars rover photos showing Martian landscape while rejecting similar Earth photos from orbit.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-361","title":"Other 361","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12823387_472799826253090_255734087457504518_o.png","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-360","title":"Other 360","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814679_469329376600135_3968805255996839095_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-362","title":"Other 362","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12823526_474892529377153_5951790268764708560_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
