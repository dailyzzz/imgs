5:T16fe,Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet using ironic wordplay "around the globe" about flat Earth movement. Screenshot of authentic Twitter post from astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson making witty observation about flat Earth movement's growth. Image shows standard Twitter interface with white background. Top left displays Tyson's profile photo - headshot showing him in dark suit with characteristic mustache and goatee, friendly expression. Next to photo shows verified Twitter account information: "Neil deGrasse Tyson" in bold black text with blue checkmark verification badge indicating authentic account. Below name shows Twitter handle "@neiltyson" in gray text. Tweet body contains single sentence in standard Twitter font (black text on white background): "I hear that the flat-Earth movement may be gaining momentum all around the globe." Tweet intentionally uses phrase "around the globe" when discussing flat Earth movement - creates ironic wordplay since flat Earth believers claim Earth is not globe. Humor lies in contradiction: if discussing flat Earth movement, why use globe terminology? Either slip revealing Tyson's globe Earth assumption, or deliberate joke poking fun at movement. Timestamp below tweet shows "10:44 AM - 8 Mar 2016" in gray text indicating when tweet was posted. Engagement metrics displayed below in gray and black text: "10,027 RETWEETS" and "23,881 LIKES" showing tweet's popularity and viral spread. Top right shows Twitter bird logo with plus sign for following/interaction. Bottom right displays "fb.com/fematters" attribution in black text on white background, indicating screenshot shared in flat Earth community. Tweet operates on multiple levels: 1) WORDPLAY: "Around the globe" is common English idiom meaning "worldwide" or "everywhere," but literal meaning references spherical Earth. Using this phrase when discussing flat Earth movement creates humorous contradiction. 2) TYSON'S INTENT: Tweet likely intended as gentle mockery - Tyson using globe terminology sarcastically implies flat Earth believers are spreading movement across spherical Earth without realizing irony. Shows Tyson's dismissive attitude toward flat Earth claims through subtle humor rather than direct confrontation. 3) SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT: Tyson is prominent science communicator, astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of Cosmos reboot. He frequently addresses pseudoscience and scientific misconceptions. Flat Earth movement began gaining internet visibility around 2014-2016 through YouTube videos, social media, leading to Tyson's 2016 observation about movement's growth. 4) "GAINING MOMENTUM": Physics pun - momentum is physics term (mass × velocity), fitting for physicist discussing movement. Also means "gaining traction" or "growing in popularity." Double meaning adds layer to wordplay. Flat Earth community's reaction to tweet likely mixed: Some might appreciate being acknowledged by prominent scientist (any attention is validation). Others might cite it as evidence establishment feels threatened by flat Earth truth spreading. Screenshot shared in flat Earth communities (fb.com/fematters attribution) suggests tweet used as evidence movement is significant enough to warrant mainstream science's attention. However, Tyson's tone is clearly mocking rather than legitimizing. Tweet reflects 2016 moment when flat Earth experienced resurgence via social media after being dormant for decades. Modern flat Earth movement primarily online phenomenon, using YouTube, Facebook, Twitter to spread despite contradicting centuries of established science. Movement gained enough visibility that prominent scientists felt compelled to address it, though usually dismissively. Irony of wordplay works because "around the globe" is so embedded in common speech that even when discussing alternative Earth shapes, globe terminology naturally emerges. This linguistic habit reflects how thoroughly spherical Earth understanding is integrated into human culture and language - countless idioms, phrases, concepts built on sphericity assumption. Scientific evidence for spherical Earth: Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, different star constellations visible from different hemispheres, time zones, seasons from axial tilt, Foucault pendulum, Coriolis effect, satellite imagery from multiple nations, circumnavigation, GPS systems requiring orbital mechanics, lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, measurements by ancient Greeks (Eratosthenes calculating circumference 240 BCE). Tweet became popular in both mainstream and flat Earth communities - mainstream appreciates clever wordplay and Tyson's wit, flat Earth community uses it as evidence their movement is growing and gaining establishment attention. Screenshot format allows viral spread beyond Twitter, appearing on Facebook, forums, memes. Tweet exemplifies science communication challenge: how to address pseudoscience without amplifying it. Tyson chose humor/mockery approach rather than detailed rebuttal. However, research shows mockery can backfire by creating persecution complex in believers, reinforcing sense they're brave truth-seekers against hostile establishment. Alternative interpretation: Tweet could be read as Tyson acknowledging flat Earth is spreading worldwide (unintentionally giving movement credibility), but wordplay suggests dismissive rather than concerned tone. Context of Tyson's other work (numerous talks, tweets, videos defending spherical Earth, explaining basic astronomy) makes clear his position: Earth is spherical, flat Earth belief represents scientific illiteracy, movement's growth is concerning but ultimately contradicts overwhelming evidence. Tweet received significant engagement (10k retweets, 23k likes) showing topic's viral potential and public interest in flat Earth controversy as curiosity/entertainment rather than serious debate.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 361 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Neil deGrasse Tyson tweet using ironic wordplay \"around the globe\" about flat Earth movement.
