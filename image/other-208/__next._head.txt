5:T647,Leonardo da Vinci quote about perception over sunset cliff landscape. Shows dramatic scenic photograph of person standing on rocky cliff edge at golden hour sunset. Person appears as dark silhouette wearing casual clothes (jacket, pants) standing with legs apart on prominent rock outcropping left side of frame. Large rocky cliff face or boulder visible on left edge. Foreground shows brown-gray rocky terrain with some sparse vegetation (grass, small bushes). Middle-ground stretches into hazy distant valley or plains area. Sky dominates upper two-thirds showing spectacular sunset - layers of clouds in purple-gray, pink, orange, and peachy tones. Bright yellow-orange sun disk visible on horizon right of center, slightly above horizon line. Warm golden-orange glow illuminates clouds from below. Top portion shows white text: 'There are three classes of people: Those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.' Attribution below: '— Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in light gray translucent text. Quote attributed to Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci suggests hierarchy of perception and understanding. Flat Earth proponents interpret themselves as 'those who see' - able to perceive truth without being shown. Mainstream believers are 'those who see when shown' - require authority to point out reality. Globe Earth believers are 'those who do not see' - refuse truth even when presented with evidence. Inspirational framing with person gazing at horizon suggests enlightenment, truth-seeking, and seeing beyond illusions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 208 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Leonardo da Vinci quote about perception over sunset cliff landscape.
