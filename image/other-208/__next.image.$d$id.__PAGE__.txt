3:T647,Leonardo da Vinci quote about perception over sunset cliff landscape. Shows dramatic scenic photograph of person standing on rocky cliff edge at golden hour sunset. Person appears as dark silhouette wearing casual clothes (jacket, pants) standing with legs apart on prominent rock outcropping left side of frame. Large rocky cliff face or boulder visible on left edge. Foreground shows brown-gray rocky terrain with some sparse vegetation (grass, small bushes). Middle-ground stretches into hazy distant valley or plains area. Sky dominates upper two-thirds showing spectacular sunset - layers of clouds in purple-gray, pink, orange, and peachy tones. Bright yellow-orange sun disk visible on horizon right of center, slightly above horizon line. Warm golden-orange glow illuminates clouds from below. Top portion shows white text: 'There are three classes of people: Those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.' Attribution below: '— Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in light gray translucent text. Quote attributed to Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci suggests hierarchy of perception and understanding. Flat Earth proponents interpret themselves as 'those who see' - able to perceive truth without being shown. Mainstream believers are 'those who see when shown' - require authority to point out reality. Globe Earth believers are 'those who do not see' - refuse truth even when presented with evidence. Inspirational framing with person gazing at horizon suggests enlightenment, truth-seeking, and seeing beyond illusions4:T562,Brian Williams meme mocking false reporting scandal applied to moon landing. Shows Brian Williams, American news anchor, sitting at NBC Nightly News desk in professional broadcast setting. Williams wears dark navy blue suit jacket, white dress shirt, lavender/light purple tie with small pattern. Has salt-and-pepper gray-brown hair neatly styled, clean-shaven face with serious neutral news anchor expression looking directly at camera. Background shows blurred multicolored lights creating typical newsroom aesthetic - green, orange, yellow bokeh lights suggesting monitors and studio equipment. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'THE MOON LANDING WAS NOT A HOAX'. Bottom text in similar style: 'I WAS THERE'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Parodies Brian Williams' 2015 scandal where he falsely claimed to have been in helicopter hit by RPG fire in Iraq War, forcing him to suspend from NBC Nightly News. Williams was caught fabricating or embellishing multiple stories throughout his career, damaging credibility of mainstream news media. Meme applies his pattern of false claims to moon landing, sarcastically suggesting if Williams vouches for it, that itself proves it's fake. Uses Williams' discredited credibility to undermine trust in moon landing narrative and mainstream media's authority to verify historical events5:T57c,Surreal awakening imagery with opening head revealing globe Earth. Shows digitally rendered 3D figure of dark silhouetted human head tilted back with top of cranium opening like hinged lid or door. Inside opened skull cavity sits photorealistic CGI globe Earth showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (North and South America visible), white cloud patterns, atmosphere glow. Earth appears to be emerging from or stored inside the head. Figure shows defined facial features - closed eyes, nose, lips in peaceful expression. Body visible below wearing dark clothing. Background shows gradient sky from light blue-white at top to darker blue-gray at bottom suggesting dawn or dusk. Top text in large white bold letters: 'THE WORLD IS WAKING UP, DON'T STAY ASLEEP'. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Image uses awakening/enlightenment metaphor suggesting people are discovering truth about Earth's shape. Implies mainstream worldview of globe Earth is mental programming or indoctrination stored in people's minds. Opening head symbolizes breaking free from conditioning, removing implanted beliefs, achieving consciousness. 'Don't stay asleep' references Matrix red pill concept and awakening to hidden reality. Suggests flat Earth awareness is spreading and viewers should join the enlightenment movement before being left behind in ignorance0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-208","title":"Other 208","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633498_458496047683468_3694862073385235037_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-207","title":"Other 207","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12622452_455815857951487_7964728843184783428_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-209","title":"Other 209","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633665_461160384083701_2590785089438878047_o.png","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
