13:T4b4,NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph with annotations pointing out alleged copy-paste duplications. Shows classic spherical Earth image with deep blue oceans, white cloud formations, and green-brown landmass visible (appears to be Central/South America). Top text in white bold letters: 'NASA'S BLUE MARBLE EARTH IMAGE' and 'CTRL + C, CTRL + V' (keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste). Image marked with colored boxes and circles highlighting supposedly identical cloud patterns in different locations across photograph. Red rectangular boxes outline cloud formations on left side. White rectangular boxes mark patterns near bottom center. Purple circles with 'Ps' (Photoshop) indicators mark suspicious areas in upper portions. Cyan/turquoise rectangular boxes highlight patterns in middle and right sections. Yellow circles mark additional questionable areas on right side. Green rectangle marks clouds near visible landmass. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Argues NASA's iconic Blue Marble photograph contains cloned/duplicated cloud patterns, suggesting digital manipulation rather than authentic photograph. Implies Earth images are computer-generated composites rather than real photos from space9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-120","title":"Other 120","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10683691_467318053467934_3913188074027476010_o.jpg","description":"Cast Away movie meme featuring Tom Hanks with wild unkempt hair and beard, mouth wide open in excited exclamation, pointing enthusiastically at camera with index finger.
