Wet wooden planks reflect orange glowing street lamps that line both sides of walkway creating symmetrical pattern. Perspective lines of wooden railings converge toward vanishing point in distance where pier meets horizon over calm water. Large white text overlaid at bottom reads 'JUST PERSPECTIVE' with small 'Flat Earth Theorem' credit in bottom right corner. Image demonstrates linear perspective principle where parallel lines appear to converge at distance, used to argue against Earth curvature as explanation for objects appearing to sink below horizon."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Perspective 9"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Artistic photograph of wooden pier or boardwalk extending into distance during twilight or dusk with dramatic cloudy blue sky.
