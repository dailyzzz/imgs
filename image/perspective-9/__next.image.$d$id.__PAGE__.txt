Wet wooden planks reflect orange glowing street lamps that line both sides of walkway creating symmetrical pattern. Perspective lines of wooden railings converge toward vanishing point in distance where pier meets horizon over calm water. Large white text overlaid at bottom reads 'JUST PERSPECTIVE' with small 'Flat Earth Theorem' credit in bottom right corner. Image demonstrates linear perspective principle where parallel lines appear to converge at distance, used to argue against Earth curvature as explanation for objects appearing to sink below horizon."},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-8","title":"Perspective 8","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36428325_194136331289765_5129232480993280000_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel meme responding to globe Earth critique about visibility of China. Top panel with red header: '\"YOU FLAT EARTHERS ARE STUPID. IF THE EARTH IS FLAT WHY CAN'T WE SEE CHINA!\"' Below shows hazy cityscape with tall buildings barely visible in smog/pollution. Red middle banner: 'BECAUSE. MIST, DUST PARTICLES, AIR DENSITY, CONVERGENCE, VANISHING POINT & YOU ARE NOT SUPERMAN, ANY MORE QUESTIONS?' Bottom panel shows black text '(II) We have this substance around us called atmosphere. This includes fog, smog, smoke, etc.... This also limits our view and stops us seeing forever. Also there are mountains, hills valleys, just to name a few more. Look at this image and ask yourself why I can't see the end of my street.

Top text reads: 'The error in perspective, which is almost universally committed, consists in causing lines dissimilarly distant from the eye-line to converge to one and the same vanishing point. Whereas it is demonstrable that lines most distant from an eye-line must of necessity converge less rapidly, and must be carried further over the eye-line before they meet it at the angle one minute, which constitutes the vanishing point.' Below shows illustration with figure standing on left observing series of progressively shorter vertical black pillars or rectangles arranged in perspective view, converging toward horizon line (marked with yellow arrow). Yellow arrows label 'EYE LEVEL' at observer's height and 'HORIZON' at ground level where pillars meet vanishing point. Demonstrates technical principle that distant objects converge to vanishing point at different rates depending on distance from eye level."}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
