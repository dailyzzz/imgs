13:T5ce,Redditor's Wife meme about flat Earth research obsession. Classic two-panel internet meme format using 'Redditor's Wife' template showing relationship priorities versus online rabbit holes. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'HONEY ARE YOU COMING TO BED?'. Image shows woman with long blonde hair wearing blue pajamas standing behind her partner who sits at computer desk. Woman has concerned, patient expression with hand on hip. Man sits hunched forward intensely focused on computer monitor, face partially visible in profile showing concentration. Entire scene bathed in cool blue tones suggesting late night/early morning. Computer screen glow illuminates man's face. Bottom text: 'AFTER I FIGURE OUT IF THE EARTH IS REALLY FLAT'. Watermark 'JM' in bottom right. Humorous commentary on people becoming consumed by conspiracy theory research, spending excessive time investigating flat Earth claims instead of normal activities like sleep. Relatable format shows partner's frustration with obsessive online behavior. Meme reflects common pattern where individuals discover flat Earth theory and become absorbed in endless YouTube videos, forums, and 'research' trying to determine truth, often at expense of relationships and responsibilities. Blue color palette reinforces late-night internet browsing aesthetic. Template originated from stock photo and became popular for depicting situations where someone prioritizes internet activity over real-world obligations14:T706,Two-panel comparison claiming superior mirage versus flat Earth proof. Top panel shows photograph of large industrial ship or offshore platform at sea. Structure appears distorted and elevated above horizon - visible sections include white superstructure, red-brown hull sections, industrial equipment, cranes all appearing to float or hover above water line. Image shows classic superior mirage optical effect where atmospheric refraction causes distant objects to appear lifted, inverted, or distorted when cold air sits below warm air creating temperature gradient. Ship components appear segmented and disjointed. Dark blue ocean water fills lower portion. Light gray-blue sky at top. White text overlay at top reads: 'THIS IS A SUPERIOR MIRAGE'. Bottom panel shows similar ocean scene at sunset or sunrise with dramatic sky. Sky displays gradient from pale yellow-cream near horizon transitioning to peachy-orange, then pink, then deeper blue at top. Horizon line shows distant city skyline or industrial structures as small dark silhouettes against bright sky - visible towers, buildings, possibly lighthouse or communications structures. Ocean shows dark blue water. Center displays large 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in white translucent text. Bottom text in large white bold letters: 'THIS IS PROOF OF FLAT EARTH'. Lower left shows 'fb.com/fematters' credit. Lower right credits 'Joshua Nowicki'. Comparison attempts to distinguish between superior mirage (temperature inversion atmospheric refraction) and distant visibility allegedly impossible on curved Earth. However, both phenomena can occur on spherical Earth. Superior mirages are well-documented optical effects. Standard refraction calculations account for atmospheric light bending allowing visibility beyond geometric horizon15:T8a5,Neil deGrasse Tyson oblate spheroid contradiction meme challenging Earth shape claims. Composite image questioning consistency of Earth shape descriptions from mainstream science. Red banner across top in white capital letters: 'SCIENCE NOW CLAIMS THE EARTH IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID THAT LOOKS LIKE A PEAR'. Below banner shows screenshot of verified Twitter/X post from Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) with blue checkmark. Tweet reads: 'Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator'. Timestamp: '9:01 AM - 19 Sep 2014'. Middle section displays three circular objects for comparison: Left shows Earth photo from July 16, 2015 (NASA/NOAA/DSCOVR) with moon visible for scale - appears perfectly round. Center shows 'PERFECT CIRCLE' label in cyan circle on black background. Right shows Jupiter image (NASA/ESA/Goddard/UCBerkeley/JPL-Caltech/STScI) with visible bands - also appears round. Text notes: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles'. Lower section shows larger Earth image with measurement annotations: 'Equatorial diameter 12,756 km - 7926.211 miles' with left-right arrow, 'Polar diameter 12,714 km - 7900.113 miles' with up-down arrow. Red text box states: 'THIS IS AN OBLATE SPHEROID (ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUATOR AND POLES)'. Bottom text in large red letters on black background: 'SOMEONE'S CLEARLY LYING'. Small logo in bottom right corner. Flat Earth argument claims photographs show Earth as perfect circle, contradicting oblate spheroid or pear shape descriptions. Points out 42 km (26 mile) difference between equatorial and polar diameters is negligible - less than 0.3% difference, imperceptible in photos. However, Earth IS measurably oblate due to rotation causing equatorial bulge. Difference is real but too small to see in most photos without precise measurements. Oblateness = (equatorial - polar) / equatorial = 0.0033 or 1/298.257. Pear shape refers to even smaller asymmetry where southern hemisphere is slightly wider - difference of mere meters, completely invisible in photographs. Scientific descriptions refer to precise geodetic measurements, not visual appearance in photos9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-257","title":"Other 257","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705553_465968800269526_6465967269783807386_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-256","title":"Other 256","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705521_470168183182921_2282890104449616899_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-258","title":"Other 258","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705695_463942567138816_8315476017983997757_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
