3:T590,Satirical NASA parody collage with Neil deGrasse Tyson in cosmic setting. Shows complex composite image mocking space science establishment. Background displays vibrant nebula space scene with purple-pink-orange clouds, stars, galaxies. Upper left corner shows NASA logo parody - blue circular badge with red swoosh replaced by word 'LIARS' in red text. Center shows woman (likely science educator or Neil deGrasse Tyson in context) with dark curly hair, brown skin, wearing sparkly dark sleeveless vest/top, looking down at hands as if manipulating objects. Multiple celestial bodies float around her as if she's arranging props: photorealistic Earth globe showing Americas, gray Moon, tan Mars-like planet with cartoon ram/Aries symbol face and rainbow vomit, blue Neptune-like planet. Lower portion shows two astronauts in white NASA spacesuits with American flag patches and mission badges. Left astronaut holds sign reading 'It's all FAKE'. Right astronaut visible in typical EVA spacesuit. Bottom displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature. Image satirizes mainstream space science by suggesting space exploration is theatrical production with Neil deGrasse Tyson as stage manager arranging props. Astronaut's 'It's all FAKE' sign explicitly states moon landing hoax belief. Portrays cosmos as artificial set pieces that can be moved by hand rather than massive distant celestial bodies4:T57c,Surreal awakening imagery with opening head revealing globe Earth. Shows digitally rendered 3D figure of dark silhouetted human head tilted back with top of cranium opening like hinged lid or door. Inside opened skull cavity sits photorealistic CGI globe Earth showing blue oceans, green-brown continents (North and South America visible), white cloud patterns, atmosphere glow. Earth appears to be emerging from or stored inside the head. Figure shows defined facial features - closed eyes, nose, lips in peaceful expression. Body visible below wearing dark clothing. Background shows gradient sky from light blue-white at top to darker blue-gray at bottom suggesting dawn or dusk. Top text in large white bold letters: 'THE WORLD IS WAKING UP, DON'T STAY ASLEEP'. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Image uses awakening/enlightenment metaphor suggesting people are discovering truth about Earth's shape. Implies mainstream worldview of globe Earth is mental programming or indoctrination stored in people's minds. Opening head symbolizes breaking free from conditioning, removing implanted beliefs, achieving consciousness. 'Don't stay asleep' references Matrix red pill concept and awakening to hidden reality. Suggests flat Earth awareness is spreading and viewers should join the enlightenment movement before being left behind in ignorance5:T5a0,Halloween skeleton decorations meme about waiting for globe Earth proof. Shows exterior daytime photograph of gray-blue house with white trim. Wooden steps/stairs leading up to doorway entrance with screen door. Multiple plastic Halloween skeleton decorations arranged on and around stairs in various waiting poses. Approximately 8-10 realistic-looking beige-white skeleton figures positioned as if sitting, standing, leaning against railings and walls in patient, bored poses. One skeleton sits hunched over on steps, another stands with arms raised, several lean against white wooden railing and siding. Green foliage/trees visible left side. Top text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'FLATEARTHERS WAITING FOR PROOF'. Center shows small 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text: 'THAT WE LIVE ON A SPINNING BALL'. Bottom right corner displays 'JM' watermark. Self-aware humor from flat Earth community acknowledging mainstream perception that they're stubbornly waiting for impossible proof. Skeleton imagery suggests they've been waiting so long they've died and decomposed - represents endless wait. Ironically reverses burden of proof argument - while mainstream science has provided extensive evidence for spherical rotating Earth, flat Earthers claim they're still waiting for satisfactory proof. Suggests no amount of evidence will convince them. Humor disarms criticism by embracing the waiting skeleton metaphor0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-210","title":"Other 210","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633729_458255607707512_7478934796738001520_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-209","title":"Other 209","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633665_461160384083701_2590785089438878047_o.png","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-211","title":"Other 211","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12633746_460550940811312_5807645605894336062_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
