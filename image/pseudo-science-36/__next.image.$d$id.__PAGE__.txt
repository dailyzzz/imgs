3:T5b3,Meme featuring iconic black and white close-up photograph of elderly Albert Einstein with characteristic wild white hair, mustache, and beard, wearing tweed jacket, looking directly at camera with penetrating gaze and slight expression. Top text in large white letters with black outline: 'I CONCLUDED THE MOVEMENT OF THE EARTH COULD NOT BE DETECTED BY ANY OPTICAL EXPERIMENT.' Bottom text: 'BUT JUST IGNORE THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO USE MY OTHER THEORIES TO PROVE THE GLOBE' with 'mematic.net' watermark. Quote references Einstein's discussion of principle of relativity - that uniform motion cannot be detected through optical experiments conducted within moving reference frame (basis of special relativity). Meme presents this as contradiction: if Einstein admitted Earth's motion cannot be optically detected, how can his other theories (general relativity, spacetime curvature) prove spherical Earth? Misrepresents Einstein's work: inability to detect absolute motion doesn't mean Earth is stationary, rather that all inertial reference frames are equivalent and motion is relative. Einstein fully accepted heliocentric model and Earth's spherical shape; his relativity theories explain why uniform motion is undetectable while maintaining Earth orbits Sun. Selective quote mining to create false inconsistency in Einstein's work, ignoring that relativity theory reconciles experimental results with Earth's motion through relative reference frames concept.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-36","title":"Pseudo Science 36","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/quote-einstein-s-relativity-work-is-a-magnificent-mathematical-garb-which-fascinates-dazzles-nikola-tesla-59-14-10.jpeg","description":"Black and white photo of Nikola Tesla with quote 'Einstein's relativity work is a magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors.
