Left panel shows actual Pluto image with characteristic heart-shaped lighter region (Tombaugh Regio) and darker reddish-brown surface against black space. Right panel shows same Pluto image with cartoon dog silhouette howling overlaid on surface, creating illusion that Pluto the Disney character is visible on Pluto the planet. Visual pun playing on shared name between celestial body and famous cartoon dog. Humorous take on NASA imagery, possibly suggesting pareidolia or questioning authenticity of space photographs"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-39","title":"Funny 39","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/FERRARI.jpeg","description":"Red Ferrari meme showing obviously fake or poorly photoshopped bright red sports car awkwardly placed on residential street among parked regular vehicles. Ferrari appears disproportionate with unrealistic lighting and shadows. Top text reads 'YOU CAN TELL IT'S A REAL FERRARI, BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO FAKE'. Bottom text shows 'ELON MUSK'. Satirical comparison between obviously fake Ferrari photo and Elon Musk's SpaceX imagery, particularly the Roadster in space footage which flat Earth community considers poor CGI. Suggests space imagery looks as unconvincing as this badly photoshopped car"},"nextImage":{"id":"funny-41","title":"Funny 41","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/a20e00812949af796c96944ade6cd88c.png","description":"Gray cat at laptop meme showing Scottish Fold or similar breed cat with distinctive rounded ears sitting at computer on beige carpeted floor. Cat has contemplative expression looking upward with wide eyes. Top text reads 'When you were looking for a recipe, but ended up browsing for 7 hours, and now the earth is definitely flat.' Watermark shows 'fb.com/fematters'. Humorous take on internet rabbit hole experience where casual browsing leads to discovering flat Earth content and becoming convinced. Relatable meme about how online research can lead to unexpected conclusions or conspiracy theories. Cat's bewildered expression suggests confusion or revelation"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
