River meandering through mixed green and golden landscape with 'AFW' watermark, 8. River through lush green forest, 9. Wide brown river with green banks, 10. River bend through green landscape. Below images, list details: '1. The Nile River in Northeast Africa, which is 4,132 miles long. 2. The Amazon River in South America, which is 4,000 miles long. 3. The Yangtze River in China, which is 3,917 miles long. 4. The Mississippi/Missouri River in the United States, which is 3,902 miles long. 5. The Yenisey-Angara-Selenga River in Mongolia and Russia, which is 3,445 miles long. 6. The Yellow River in China, which is 3,398 miles long. 7. The Ob - Irtysh River, which runs through Russia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia. It is 3,365 miles long. 8. The Congo - Chambeshi River in Central Africa, which is 2,922 miles long. 9.

Used in flat Earth arguments to demonstrate water flowing thousands of miles horizontally, questioning how rivers can flow such distances over supposed curved Earth surface14:T430,Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at viewer. Top text reads 'POUR WATER INTO A CUP IT BECOMES THE CUP. POUR IT INTO A TEAPOT IT BECOMES THE TEAPOT.' Bottom text states 'POUR WATER ONTO A BALL....IT FALLS OFF.' References Bruce Lee's famous philosophical quote 'Be like water, my friend' about water's adaptability taking shape of its container. Original quote celebrates water's flexibility and formlessness. Meme adds humorous/argumentative twist by extending analogy to spherical Earth: while water adapts to shape of containers (cup, teapot), it cannot remain on curved surface of ball due to gravity causing it to fall off. Argues this observable property of water (runs off curved surfaces) contradicts spherical Earth model where oceans supposedly adhere to curved planet. Uses Bruce Lee's water philosophy ironically to support flat Earth argument - water's tendency to seek level and flow downward means it cannot stick to outside of spinning ball9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-23","title":"Water Level 23","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/image-64.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-22","title":"Water Level 22","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53723677_10156623770049807_1899431273563160576_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":null}]
