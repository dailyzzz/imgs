5:T4c2,Breathtaking photograph of Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia with water level message. Shows world's largest salt flat during rainy season when thin layer of water creates perfect mirror effect. Lone person wearing dark clothing and backpack stands in center, body and reflection creating symmetrical composition. Person appears as silhouette with perfect mirror image below. Sky shows brilliant blue with scattered white puffy clouds that reflect identically in water below, creating surreal effect where sky and ground are indistinguishable. Horizon line between sky and water reflection is nearly invisible. Clouds appear both above and below central figure. Water surface appears absolutely flat and level like perfect mirror. Top text in bold white outlined letters: 'WATER ALWAYS FINDS'. Bottom text: 'ITS LEVEL'. Bottom right shows 'JM' watermark. Uses one of nature's most spectacular mirror phenomena to argue water's fundamental property is seeking perfectly level surface. Salar de Uyuni's mirror effect demonstrates water's levelness over vast distance (10,000+ square kilometers). Argues if Earth were curved sphere, water couldn't create such perfect flat mirror extending to horizon in all directions0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 162 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Breathtaking photograph of Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia with water level message.
