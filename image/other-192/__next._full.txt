13:T526,Historical azimuthal equidistant map with ornate decorative elements. Shows antique Dutch cartographic artifact titled 'AERDSCHE' (partially visible at top) meaning 'Earthly' in Dutch. Large circular map projection with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map shows Americas on left in pink/red, Europe top-center in gray, Asia right side in yellow-tan, Africa lower center, Australia bottom-right in green. Grid lines create latitude/longitude network. Outer ring decorated with gold/yellow ornamental border with black markings. Corners adorned with elaborate allegorical illustrations - cherubs, angels, mythological figures representing four winds or seasons in baroque style with flowing robes, clouds. Upper corners show figures in blue/gold/red classical dress. Lower corners feature figures in green/brown/red garments. Figures hold various objects (flags, instruments, scrolls). Map center shows compass rose with radiating lines. Geographic features labeled in Latin/Dutch. Bottom banner: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text. Historical azimuthal equidistant projections were standard for polar navigation before modern era. Flat Earth proponents cite these historical maps as evidence cartographers knew true Earth shape, though projection is geometrically valid for spherical Earth navigation14:T4bd,Leonardo DiCaprio laughing meme mocking Eratosthenes experiment. Shows scene from Django Unchained (2012) with Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie character in period costume. DiCaprio wears cream/beige suit jacket, white dress shirt, dark bow tie or cravat. Sits at table with wine glass visible. Background shows blurred figure (Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen) in dark suit. DiCaprio's face shows intense laughter - mouth wide open showing teeth, eyes squinting, leaning back in chair. Warm amber lighting suggests candlelit interior. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'WHEN SOMEONE SAYS'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center-bottom shows 'JM' logo. Bottom text: 'WE HAVE BEEN PROVING THE EARTH IS ROUND WITH STICKS IN THE SAND SINCE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION.' Mocks Eratosthenes' famous experiment (circa 240 BCE) measuring Earth's circumference using shadows cast by sticks in different cities. Flat Earth proponents argue this experiment only proves sun is close and local, not that Earth is sphere. Points out same shadow length differences occur with nearby light source over flat plane. Uses DiCaprio's condescending laughter to suggest belief in ancient stick experiment is naive15:T4a3,Brian Cox tweet defending moon landing overlaid on Apollo photograph. Background shows famous moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit planting American flag on lunar surface, gray rocky moon terrain, black space sky. Foreground shows Twitter interface screenshot of verified tweet from Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox), British physicist and TV presenter. Profile picture shows Cox's face. Blue verified checkmark next to name. Gear icon and 'Follow' button visible. Tweet text reads: 'I've said it before and I'll say it again - if you don't think Apollo 11 landed on Moon you are a colossal nob end & should get a new brain'. Bottom shows engagement metrics: '18,106 RETWEETS' and '5,483 FAVORITES' (old Twitter interface). Row of small profile pictures showing people who engaged with tweet. Cox's aggressive dismissive tone ('colossal nob end' - British insult) represents mainstream scientific community's contempt for moon landing skeptics. Tweet suggests questioning official narrative warrants ridicule rather than rational debate. Flat Earth/moon landing skeptics use this as example of argument from authority and ad hominem attacks instead of evidence-based discussion9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-192","title":"Other 192","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12549026_455543561312050_8252161165943916382_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-191","title":"Other 191","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12540859_457952671071139_8379451833016280622_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-193","title":"Other 193","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552561_457569974442742_6404651084500412606_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
