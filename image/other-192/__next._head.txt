5:T526,Historical azimuthal equidistant map with ornate decorative elements. Shows antique Dutch cartographic artifact titled 'AERDSCHE' (partially visible at top) meaning 'Earthly' in Dutch. Large circular map projection with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Map shows Americas on left in pink/red, Europe top-center in gray, Asia right side in yellow-tan, Africa lower center, Australia bottom-right in green. Grid lines create latitude/longitude network. Outer ring decorated with gold/yellow ornamental border with black markings. Corners adorned with elaborate allegorical illustrations - cherubs, angels, mythological figures representing four winds or seasons in baroque style with flowing robes, clouds. Upper corners show figures in blue/gold/red classical dress. Lower corners feature figures in green/brown/red garments. Figures hold various objects (flags, instruments, scrolls). Map center shows compass rose with radiating lines. Geographic features labeled in Latin/Dutch. Bottom banner: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in gray text. Historical azimuthal equidistant projections were standard for polar navigation before modern era. Flat Earth proponents cite these historical maps as evidence cartographers knew true Earth shape, though projection is geometrically valid for spherical Earth navigation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 192 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical azimuthal equidistant map with ornate decorative elements.
