Top text in bold white and orange: 'WHEN METAL IS HEATED IT LOSES ITS MAGNETIC PROPERTIES' with Discovery News logo. Center shows Blue Marble Earth photo and cutaway diagram of Earth's interior layers (crust, mantle, outer core in red/orange, inner core in yellow) with glowing heated appearance. Bottom text in white: 'GRAVITY DEPENDS ON THE THEORY OF MAGNETISM GENERATED BY A SUPER HEATED MOLTEN METAL INNER CORE.' with 'edgp.com' watermark. Argues logical contradiction: if heated metal loses magnetism (Curie point), Earth's molten metal core cannot generate magnetic field, yet gravity theory supposedly depends on Earth's magnetic core. Actually conflates two separate phenomena - gravity (mass attraction) and magnetism (electromagnetic field) - which mainstream science treats as distinct forces"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-18","title":"Gravity 18","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/39515128_10215594010460573_3870648428648202240_n.jpeg","description":"Satirical portrait meme featuring classical oil painting of Isaac Newton with long wavy brown hair against dark background. Black background with white text: 'Sorry folks but I didn't know a DAMN THING about electromagnetic influences when hypothesizing the far fetched concept of gravity which \"I my self\" personally never tested or shared with anyone while I was still alive.' Below in large elegant script: 'Sincerely yours, the cherry picked Jesuit fraud: Sir Isaac Newton' with hashtag '#VaticanFraudInc'. Alleges Newton was Jesuit agent who fraudulently invented gravity concept without understanding electromagnetism (discovered later) or conducting experiments. Claims Newton's work was selectively promoted by Vatican to advance false cosmology. Conspiracy theory positioning Newton as religious operative rather than legitimate scientist"},"nextImage":{"id":"gravity-20","title":"Gravity 20","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/43155466_2137461599618691_7730291390147461120_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel meme criticizing gravitational wave detection.
