3:T401,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Earth's orbital motion. Top panel shows person driving Toyota car from interior view with hands on steering wheel, blurred motion through windshield, dashboard visible. White text reads 'WHEN A CAR SHIFTS IN ACCELERATION YOU FEEL IT'. Bottom panel shows diagram of Earth's elliptical orbit around sun with cyan/blue background. Shows sun (yellow circle) at center with Earth at two positions: 'Aphelion July 4' at 152,500,000 km (94,500,000 mi) on left, and 'Perihelion January 3' at 147,500,000 km (91,500,000 mi) on right. White text asks 'WHY DONT YOU FEEL IT WHEN THE EARTH SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN???' Argues that if Earth accelerates and decelerates during elliptical orbit (moving faster at perihelion, slower at aphelion per Kepler's laws), humans should feel this acceleration like in car. Ignores that orbital changes are extremely gradual over months with negligible acceleration compared to human perception threshold, and that we're in Earth's reference frame moving with it0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-23","title":"The Sun 23","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/30688896_1654674597914841_8775100974411808768_n.jpeg","description":"Spectacular sunset photograph over ocean beach showing dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through cloud gap.

Bright golden-yellow sun rays (crepuscular rays) burst dramatically through gaps in dark gray cloud layers, creating spectacular light beams radiating downward and across scene. Multiple layers of clouds at different altitudes show varying illumination: some backlit with golden edges, others appearing dark gray in silhouette. Upper atmosphere shows mixture of gold and dark tones with clouds breaking apart. Lower portion shows golden rays reflecting off ocean surface creating shimmering path. Sky displays dramatic color gradient from bright golden-yellow where sun breaks through to darker gray-brown in shadowed areas.
