Bright yellow-orange sun sits just above horizon partially obscured by dark gray cloud bank, with multiple distinct light beams radiating upward through clear blue sky above clouds in fan pattern. Golden sunset light illuminates lower clouds and ocean surface. Beach with sandy shore and small waves visible in foreground. Sky shows beautiful gradient from deep blue at top through lighter blue to golden orange near horizon. Milky Way galaxy faintly visible in upper center of darkening sky. Classic example of anticrepuscular and crepuscular rays where parallel sunlight creates appearance of diverging beams due to perspective, demonstrating same optical principle as converging railroad tracks.
