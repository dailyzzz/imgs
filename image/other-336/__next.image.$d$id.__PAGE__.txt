3:T11ed,Spectacular ocean sunset photograph with flat Earth watermark suggesting flat horizon proves flat Earth. Breathtaking seascape showing sun touching horizon during golden hour sunset over ocean/sea. Sun appears as bright yellow-white orb positioned exactly at horizon line in center of frame creating dramatic focal point. Sky dominates upper two-thirds of image showing layered cloud formations in stunning gradient of warm colors. Directly above horizon, sky glows intense yellow-orange gradually transitioning upward through deeper orange, red-orange, amber, and dark orange-red tones. Upper sky transitions to darker tones - russet, brown, gray, purple-gray as altitude increases. Cloud layer consists of altocumulus or stratocumulus formations creating textured ceiling across entire frame. Clouds appear as individual puffy masses separated by darker gaps, creating mottled appearance with three-dimensional depth. Underside of clouds illuminated brilliant gold-orange by setting sun, while top edges appear darker creating chiaroscuro effect. Cloud bases create horizontal striations across sky. Light rays (crepuscular rays) visible as subtle radial patterns emanating from sun position, though somewhat obscured by clouds. Lower third shows ocean water surface appearing dark blue-black or deep purple-gray in contrast to bright sky. Water reflects setting sun creating vertical columnar reflection - bright yellow-orange streak extending from sun down to bottom frame edge. Reflection column shows rippled pattern from gentle wave action on water surface, creating broken sparkling effect rather than perfect mirror. Reflection demonstrates specular reflection on textured surface. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level stretching horizontally across frame dividing brilliant sky from dark water - this flat appearance of horizon is key visual element referenced by watermark. Water surface in foreground shows gentle rolling wave with white foam crest creating light colored line parallel to shore. Wave creates slight texture breaking up otherwise smooth water surface. Sandy beach or wet shoreline visible in immediate foreground bottom edge appearing as darkest element in frame. Lower left corner contains text overlay in light gray sans-serif font: "Flat Earth Matters" - flat Earth movement slogan/hashtag. Image represents common flat Earth visual argument: horizon appears perfectly flat and level from observer's ground-level vantage point, suggesting Earth's surface must be flat plane rather than curved sphere. However, this interpretation fundamentally misunderstands scale and perspective. Scientific explanation: From sea level, human observer can see to horizon approximately 3 miles away (distance depends on observer height - 6 feet tall person sees to 3 miles, standing on 10-foot platform extends to 3.9 miles). At these short distances on planet with 7,917-mile diameter, curvature is geometrically negligible - approximately 6 feet of drop over 3-mile distance. Human eye cannot resolve such subtle curvature, especially when viewing horizon as thin line between contrasting elements (bright sky, dark water). Horizon appearing flat at human scale says nothing about Earth's overall shape - same principle as tabletop appearing flat despite Earth's curvature, or calm lake appearing flat despite planet's sphericity. Earth's curvature becomes visible only from higher altitudes: commercial aircraft at 35,000-40,000 feet show subtle curvature when horizon spans wider field of view, while curvature becomes obvious from 100,000+ feet (high-altitude balloons, spacecraft). Bedford Level experiment demonstrated in 1838 that distant objects on long waterway appear to drop below line of sight consistent with Earth's curvature, contradicting flat Earth expectations. Columnar sun reflection on water occurs identically on spherical Earth as it would on flat plane - only requires locally smooth surface within visible range. Photograph's beauty makes it effective propaganda piece - emotionally compelling sunset scene attached to flat Earth message creates positive association, while horizon's apparent flatness serves as "evidence" requiring no technical knowledge to interpret. However, same image actually demonstrates atmospheric refraction (sun's oval shape, color changes from atmospheric scattering), sunset mechanics that work identically on spherical Earth, and horizon geometry consistent with large spherical planet viewed from ground level. Attribution should credit original photographer, though source unclear from watermark alone.4:Te8e,"Not bad" meme format mocking Barack Obama, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson using pear-shaped Earth reference. Two-panel vertical meme using popular Obama "not bad" reaction image format. Top panel shows President Barack Obama in dark suit with presidential seal visible on left edge, American flag in background. Obama holds left hand up in dismissive stopping gesture near face, expression showing skepticism or rejection. Gray/neutral background. Text overlay at top in large bold white letters with black outline: "DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY" - suggesting Obama dismissed or ignored flat Earth believers as unworthy of attention. Bottom panel shows casual photograph of three prominent science communicators at what appears to be social event or gathering. Left: Bill Nye (Science Guy) with reddish-brown hair and bow tie (signature look), broad smile showing teeth. Center: Barack Obama in lighter colored suit (gray or tan), white dress shirt, smiling warmly at camera showing characteristic wide grin. Right: Neil deGrasse Tyson (astrophysicist/science educator) with distinctive mustache, showing partial smile. All three men appear happy and friendly, captured in close selfie-style photograph suggesting camaraderie. Warm indoor lighting, yellowish/beige background. Text overlay at bottom in matching large bold white letters: "BUT HAS TIME FOR THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY" - mocking reference to Neil deGrasse Tyson's scientific statement that Earth is slightly pear-shaped (oblate spheroid with Southern Hemisphere slightly wider than Northern). Lower right corner shows "Nick Havok" photographer credit. Meme employs hypocrisy accusation format suggesting: 1) Obama won't acknowledge flat Earth believers, 2) But associates with scientists (Nye/Tyson) who make "absurd" claims about pear-shaped Earth, 3) Implying mainstream scientists are equally ridiculous as flat Earthers but receive different treatment. Rhetorical strategy attempts to create false equivalency between scientifically accurate statement (Earth is oblate spheroid) and pseudoscience (flat Earth), suggesting both are equally "crazy" but one receives establishment endorsement while other is marginalized. Context: Tyson's "pear-shaped" comment refers to precise satellite measurements showing Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - Southern Hemisphere bulge ~20 meters wider than Northern Hemisphere bulge. This 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid is measured by GRACE satellites and is scientifically accurate, though term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle asymmetry imperceptible to naked eye. Obama has publicly praised science education and supported NASA, appearing with science communicators like Nye and Tyson to promote STEM education and climate change awareness. Bill Nye is mechanical engineer and science educator known for PBS show "Bill Nye the Science Guy" targeting children. Neil deGrasse Tyson is astrophysicist, director of Hayden Planetarium, host of "Cosmos" reboot. Both are prominent science advocates often targeted by conspiracy theorists for defending mainstream scientific consensus. Meme's humor (from flat Earth perspective) relies on: 1) Obama's dismissive hand gesture reused for opposite meaning, 2) Ironic juxtaposition of rejecting "obviously correct" flat Earth while accepting "absurd" pear Earth, 3) Suggestion that scientific establishment is hypocritical social club rather than evidence-based institution. However, fundamental difference: flat Earth contradicted by millennia of evidence, while Earth's oblate shape with asymmetric bulge is precisely measured fact confirmed by multiple independent observations.5:Te2f,"Sheeple" meme showing sheep watching globe Earth on television, suggesting blind acceptance of mainstream narratives. Black and white photograph creating stark visual metaphor. Right side shows sheep's head in profile facing left toward television screen - wool appears textured and light-colored in monochrome, face shows typical ovine features with curved nose, visible eye, ears positioned back. Sheep positioned as attentive viewer, head tilted slightly toward screen suggesting focused attention. Left side displays vintage box television set (likely 1960s-1970s style) with rounded screen, antenna protruding from top, control knobs visible on side panel. TV sits on what appears to be barrel or cylindrical platform. Screen displays iconic "Blue Marble" photograph of Earth from space - full disk of Earth showing blue oceans, white cloud swirls, green-brown continents visible, particularly recognizable landmass shapes. Earth image appears as bright glowing sphere against TV's dark background. Composition creates direct visual line between sheep and globe Earth image, suggesting sheep is receiving information/programming from television. Dark background isolates subjects creating dramatic lighting focused on sheep's illuminated face and glowing TV screen. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Image serves as visual metaphor employing term "sheeple" (portmanteau of "sheep" + "people") commonly used in conspiracy theory communities to describe general population who supposedly follow mainstream narratives without critical thinking or questioning. Message suggests: 1) People are like sheep - docile, herd-following animals who blindly accept what they're told, 2) Television/media acts as programming device feeding population false information, 3) Globe Earth model is lie perpetuated through media repetition rather than empirical truth, 4) Those who believe Earth is spherical do so because they've been "programmed" by television/education rather than personal investigation. Meme implies flat Earth believers have awakened from programming while masses remain asleep, accepting globe Earth because "TV said so." This rhetoric positions flat Earth belief as independent thinking versus mainstream "sheep-like" acceptance. However, argument is logically flawed: 1) Globe Earth predates television by millennia - ancient Greeks calculated Earth's circumference around 240 BCE, 2) Evidence for spherical Earth comes from direct observations available to anyone (ship hulls disappearing over horizon first, different star constellations in different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, lunar eclipses showing round Earth shadow, etc.), not just media, 3) Dismissing opposing views as "programmed" is ad hominem fallacy avoiding engagement with actual evidence, 4) "Sheeple" accusation assumes disagreement stems from gullibility rather than evaluation of evidence. Ironically, flat Earth belief often spreads through social media echo chambers where believers reinforce each other's views without rigorous testing - exhibiting herd behavior the meme criticizes. Scientific consensus on spherical Earth based on thousands of years of accumulated observations, measurements, and experiments by independent researchers across all cultures and time periods, not television programming. Photograph's black-and-white aesthetic adds gravitas and artistic quality to message, making it more shareable and memorable in flat Earth communities. Format is concise visual argument requiring no complex explanation - immediately communicates idea that accepting globe Earth equals being mindless sheep.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-336","title":"Other 336","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801193_468490566684016_7036204766816387195_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-335","title":"Other 335","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801147_468509303348809_6666016191156905904_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-337","title":"Other 337","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12801418_469038806629192_3289755197121663397_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
