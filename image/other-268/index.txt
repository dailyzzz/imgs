13:T858,Robert Simmon quote about photoshopped Earth images from NASA. Infographic featuring NASA Earth photograph with controversial quote about image processing. Top text in light blue on black background: 'The Only People Who Are Mad At You For Speaking The Truth Are Those Who Are Living A Lie'. Center shows famous NASA Earth photograph - Blue Marble-style image of Earth from space showing North America continent prominently. Image displays spherical Earth with deep blue oceans, white swirling cloud formations, brown-tan-green landmasses showing southwestern USA, Mexico, Central America. White polar ice/clouds visible at top. Pacific Ocean on left, Atlantic on right. Photorealistic appearance with cloud shadows, atmospheric glow at edges. Across center of Earth image, large bold white text overlaid: 'YOUR WORLD IS PHOTOSHOPPED'. Below Earth photo, explanatory quote box: '"It is photoshopped but it has to be" says Data Visualizer and designer Robert Simmon, "Mr Blue Marble" (NASA)'. Bottom displays 'Flat Earth Matters' in large blue text on black background. Quote refers to Robert Simmon's explanation that NASA Earth images are composite images created from multiple satellite passes, stitched together and color-corrected. This is standard practice because: 1) Satellites orbit at 400-36,000 km altitude, too close to photograph entire Earth hemisphere in single frame, 2) Different sensors capture different wavelengths requiring processing to create true-color images, 3) Multiple orbital passes needed to compile cloud-free views, 4) Image processing enhances features for public/scientific use. 'Photoshopped' doesn't mean fake - means processed/composited. Similar to how smartphone photos are processed. Flat Earth community presents this as admission of fraud, but Simmon explained it's necessary technical process to create usable images from raw satellite data. Thousands of Earth photos exist from various sources (Apollo missions, ISS, DSCOVR satellite, astronauts, weather satellites) all showing spherical Earth. Quote taken out of context to suggest deception when actually describes standard image processing14:T7f7,Dubai skyline aerial photograph with flat Earth claim. Aerial/elevated photograph of Dubai, United Arab Emirates showing expansive cityscape. Center-left features iconic Burj Khalifa - world's tallest building at 828 meters (2,717 feet) appearing as distinctive tall spire with tapering design rising dramatically above surrounding buildings. Dense cluster of modern skyscrapers surrounds Burj Khalifa forming downtown Dubai skyline. Multiple high-rise towers visible showing glass, steel, concrete construction. Buildings decrease in height moving away from center creating skyline profile. Foreground shows lower-rise development with visible street grid pattern, some greenspace, residential areas. Middle ground shows more urban development, roads, infrastructure spreading outward. Background extends to distant horizon showing flat desert landscape fading into atmospheric haze. Sky occupies upper half - gradient from darker blue-gray at top to lighter white-gray near horizon suggesting either early morning/late afternoon lighting or atmospheric dust/pollution. Haze creates layers of decreasing visibility with distance. Lower right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT AND THAT IS THAT'. Photograph appears to be taken from aircraft, tall building, or drone at significant elevation (possibly 1000+ feet) looking toward downtown Dubai from northeast or east direction. Flat Earth argument uses long-distance visibility as 'proof' - claims visible horizon distance would be limited by curvature on sphere. However, from elevation of ~1000 feet, geometric horizon is approximately 39 miles away. Atmospheric refraction extends this further. Dubai skyline and desert landscape visible within this range. Earth's curvature of 8 inches per mile squared only becomes visually apparent at much greater distances or altitudes. Photograph actually demonstrates atmospheric perspective (things become hazier with distance) rather than proving flat Earth15:T7d2,High altitude curved horizon photograph conversion story meme. Two-panel meme describing flat Earth conversion moment. Top text in large bold white letters: 'HOW DID I BECOME A FLAT EARTHER?'. Main image shows spectacular high-altitude photograph taken from aircraft or weather balloon. View looks across curved horizon showing Earth's curvature. Upper portion displays dark gradient sky transitioning from nearly black space at top through deep blue, then lighter blue closer to horizon. Stars visible as white specks in darkest regions suggesting very high altitude (possibly 60,000+ feet or lower stratosphere). Horizon shows subtle but definite curve spanning width of image. Below horizon line visible cloud formations or terrain features - lighter tan/beige coloring with blue-gray atmospheric layers. Reflection or bright area visible on surface possibly from sun glare on water or clouds. Right side shows slight pinkish-purple atmospheric glow. Lower portion shows more cloud coverage in lighter tones. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'I TRIED DEBUNKING THE FLAT EARTH'. Lower right corner shows 'Nick Havok' signature/watermark. Meme describes common flat Earth conversion narrative where skeptics claim they initially set out to disprove flat Earth theory but became convinced by their research. Ironically, image actually shows Earth's curvature - gentle arc of horizon visible across frame. However, some flat Earthers claim this curvature is fisheye lens distortion from camera. At very high altitudes (above 50,000 feet), Earth's curvature becomes clearly visible to human eye and cameras with wide-angle lenses. Standard windows and cameras can show curvature from commercial flight altitudes (~35,000 feet) though more subtle. Image demonstrates exactly what debunking flat Earth would show - observable curvature. Common psychological phenomenon where confirmation bias leads people to interpret evidence supporting preexisting beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-268","title":"Other 268","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717195_464587673740972_8818418021323406562_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-267","title":"Other 267","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716330_462744343925305_5487955060240283810_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-269","title":"Other 269","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12717444_466164306916642_6606864137146950786_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
