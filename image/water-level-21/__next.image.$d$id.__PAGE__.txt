3:T468,Five-panel meme demonstrating water's level property at all scales with Dr. Evil reference. Top row shows glass of clear water with reflection on left, and luxury modern bathtub with white towel on right. Middle section displays large text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with yellow spirit level tool (bubble level) showing centered bubble proving levelness. Fourth panel shows stunning tropical infinity pool with overwater bungalows, wooden deck with lounge chairs, crystal clear turquoise water merging seamlessly with ocean horizon. Bottom panel shows Dr. Evil character (Mike Myers from Austin Powers) in gray outfit with pinkie finger raised to mouth making exaggerated expression, with quote '"CONSPIRACY THEORY"' in white text. Watermark 'FLAT EARTH LUNACY'. Meme argues that water's observable level property in all containers (glass, bathtub, infinity pool, ocean) is established physics, using spirit level as proof. Bottom panel sarcastically suggests calling water's levelness a 'conspiracy theory' is absurd when it's demonstrable fact, implying those who deny observable water levelness are the real conspiracy theorists4:T4e0,Screenshot of Wikipedia article on 'Fluid statics' with key passage highlighted. Header shows 'Fluid statics' with 'Main article: Fluid statics' link below. Article text reads: 'Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest. It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium; and is contrasted with fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red underlines emphasize final phrase 'the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red boxes also highlight 'Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics'. Uses mainstream scientific source (Wikipedia article on fluid statics/hydrostatics) to support flat Earth argument by citing established physics principle that water surface is always level and horizontal regardless of container shape. Argues this accepted scientific fact contradicts spherical Earth model where water must conform to curved surface5:T430,Bruce Lee meme with black and white artistic portrait illustration showing martial artist with intense focused expression, dark hair, looking directly at viewer. Top text reads 'POUR WATER INTO A CUP IT BECOMES THE CUP. POUR IT INTO A TEAPOT IT BECOMES THE TEAPOT.' Bottom text states 'POUR WATER ONTO A BALL....IT FALLS OFF.' References Bruce Lee's famous philosophical quote 'Be like water, my friend' about water's adaptability taking shape of its container. Original quote celebrates water's flexibility and formlessness. Meme adds humorous/argumentative twist by extending analogy to spherical Earth: while water adapts to shape of containers (cup, teapot), it cannot remain on curved surface of ball due to gravity causing it to fall off. Argues this observable property of water (runs off curved surfaces) contradicts spherical Earth model where oceans supposedly adhere to curved planet. Uses Bruce Lee's water philosophy ironically to support flat Earth argument - water's tendency to seek level and flow downward means it cannot stick to outside of spinning ball0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-21","title":"Water Level 21","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53450783_2169586853100741_162883413475328000_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-20","title":"Water Level 20","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53403647_3121354081223608_5848837827483140096_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-22","title":"Water Level 22","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53723677_10156623770049807_1899431273563160576_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
