5:T468,Five-panel meme demonstrating water's level property at all scales with Dr. Evil reference. Top row shows glass of clear water with reflection on left, and luxury modern bathtub with white towel on right. Middle section displays large text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with yellow spirit level tool (bubble level) showing centered bubble proving levelness. Fourth panel shows stunning tropical infinity pool with overwater bungalows, wooden deck with lounge chairs, crystal clear turquoise water merging seamlessly with ocean horizon. Bottom panel shows Dr. Evil character (Mike Myers from Austin Powers) in gray outfit with pinkie finger raised to mouth making exaggerated expression, with quote '"CONSPIRACY THEORY"' in white text. Watermark 'FLAT EARTH LUNACY'. Meme argues that water's observable level property in all containers (glass, bathtub, infinity pool, ocean) is established physics, using spirit level as proof. Bottom panel sarcastically suggests calling water's levelness a 'conspiracy theory' is absurd when it's demonstrable fact, implying those who deny observable water levelness are the real conspiracy theorists0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 21 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Five-panel meme demonstrating water's level property at all scales with Dr. Evil reference.
