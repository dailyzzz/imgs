13:T14ce,Neil deGrasse Tyson pear-shaped Earth visual pun meme with actual pears. Professional portrait photograph of astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson modified with text to mock his statement about Earth being pear-shaped. Image shows formal studio portrait with clean gradient background - teal-green-blue gradient fading from darker at edges to lighter in center creating professional headshot aesthetic. Tyson sits facing camera in relaxed but dignified pose - body slightly turned, upper body and hands visible. He wears formal business attire: dark navy blue three-piece suit (jacket, vest, trousers) with crisp white dress shirt and distinctive necktie featuring space/astronomy theme - tie shows dark blue background with nebula patterns, stars, cosmic imagery appropriate for renowned astrophysicist. Suit fits well showing professional tailoring. Tyson's hands positioned holding white dinner plate at waist/chest level presenting contents toward camera. On plate sit three green pears - Bartlett or Anjou pears with characteristic pyriform (pear) shape, green-yellow skin showing natural coloring and subtle brown spotting, stems still attached pointing upward. Pears arranged artfully on plate creating still-life composition. Tyson's facial expression shows slight knowing smile with raised eyebrows suggesting amusement or playfulness - expression could be interpreted as presenting something significant or offering pears literally. His distinctive features visible: mustache, goatee, characteristic friendly demeanor. Professional studio lighting illuminates subject evenly with soft shadows. Text overlay at top in large sans-serif font: "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" in light gray or white letters creating title/context. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Visual pun operates on multiple levels: 1) Tyson famously stated Earth is "pear-shaped" referring to scientific fact that Earth is oblate spheroid (flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation) with additional asymmetry where Southern Hemisphere's equatorial bulge is slightly larger than Northern Hemisphere's (measured difference of ~20 meters). Term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid. 2) Meme takes Tyson's technical statement literally by showing him holding actual pears - visual joke suggesting if Earth is "pear-shaped" according to scientist, here are pears to represent it. Mockery suggests claim is absurd by literalizing metaphor. 3) Flat Earth community frequently targets Tyson (along with Bill Nye) as prominent science communicators defending mainstream cosmology. His pear-Earth statement became focal point for mockery because awkward phrasing made accurate science sound ridiculous to lay audience. Presenting actual pears frames scientific statement as nonsensical. However, Tyson's statement was scientifically accurate: precise measurements from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites show Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - equatorial radius at Southern Hemisphere approximately 20 meters greater than Northern Hemisphere at equatorial plane. This deviation from perfect oblate spheroid creates very slight "pear" asymmetry. Difference is real, measurable, and scientifically significant for understanding Earth's mass distribution and gravitational field variations, though imperceptible to naked eye from space. Earth's oblateness itself (polar vs equatorial diameter difference of 43 km out of 12,742 km diameter = 0.33%) results from centrifugal force due to rotation - fundamental physics principle. Tyson's use of "pear-shaped" was popularization attempt to explain technical concept to general audience, but backfired by creating misleading mental image. Better description: "very slightly asymmetric oblate spheroid." Meme's humor exploits communication failure - technically correct statement that sounds absurd when taken literally. Photograph appears to be manipulated - Tyson likely photographed for different purpose, pears digitally added or composite created. His expression and body language suggest formal portrait rather than deliberately posing with pears. Professional photography quality and composition indicate stock portrait or publicity photo. Effectiveness in flat Earth communities stems from: 1) Ridiculing prominent science advocate, 2) Suggesting mainstream scientists make obviously ridiculous claims, 3) Implies globe Earth model is inconsistent ("first it's sphere, then oblate spheroid, now pear-shaped - make up your mind"), 4) Visual humor makes message shareable and memorable. Irony: meme mocks accurate science by presenting literal interpretation of metaphor, while flat Earth model contradicts overwhelming evidence from navigation, astronomy, physics. Tyson has addressed pear-Earth controversy multiple times, clarifying measurement precision and explaining why Earth's shape deviates slightly from perfect sphere while emphasizing overall sphericity. Scientific understanding requires precision - Earth is sphere to first approximation, oblate spheroid to second approximation, asymmetric oblate spheroid to third approximation. Each refinement represents increased measurement precision, not contradiction of previous understanding.14:T1362,Leonardo DiCaprio meme holding blank "proof list" suggesting no evidence exists for globe Earth. Photograph of actor Leonardo DiCaprio at formal event modified with text overlay to mock evidence for spherical Earth. DiCaprio stands in professional setting facing camera in three-quarter view, body slightly angled left, head turned toward camera with serious contemplative expression. He wears formal attire: black suit jacket, white dress shirt with collar open (no tie), creating semi-formal appearance. Dark blonde hair styled back in signature swept style. Facial hair shows light beard and mustache. Age appears late 30s to early 40s (photo likely from 2010s). Hands positioned holding large rectangular white paper/poster board at chest level - paper approximately 18"x24" size held portrait orientation. Background shows official/diplomatic setting: dark purple-blue backdrop with visible UN (United Nations) flag on right side - light blue flag showing UN emblem (world map surrounded by olive branches). Purple-blue curtains/drapes frame scene suggesting press conference or official UN event. Professional lighting illuminates subject evenly. DiCaprio is prominent climate change activist and UN Messenger of Peace, frequently speaks at UN climate conferences, making this appear to be authentic UN appearance photograph. White paper/board DiCaprio holds contains text in black sans-serif font centered near top: "HERE IS A LIST OF PROOFS FOR THE GLOBE" - title suggests comprehensive evidence catalog will follow. However, rest of paper is COMPLETELY BLANK - intentionally empty white space occupying ~80% of visible paper. Blank space is the joke's punchline: alleged "list of proofs" contains nothing, suggesting zero valid evidence exists for spherical Earth. Lower left corner shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme format uses blank list/empty page template to suggest something widely accepted has no supporting evidence - common rhetorical device in conspiracy communities. Applied to flat Earth specifically: mainstream claims Earth is sphere but supposedly cannot provide proof, leaving list empty. Intended message: despite widespread acceptance, scientific establishment has no actual evidence for globe Earth model. All supposed "proofs" are either misinterpreted observations, assumptions, or lies. Blank paper represents absence of genuine evidence. Using DiCaprio is strategic choice: 1) Celebrity known for passionate advocacy of scientific consensus on climate change, 2) Frequently appears at UN representing scientific community's positions, 3) His serious expression and formal setting add gravitas to joke, 4) Creates ironic contrast - voice of scientific establishment holding proof list with nothing on it. However, meme's premise is demonstrably false. Evidence for spherical Earth is extensive, ancient, and directly observable: 1) Ships disappear hull-first over horizon (visible to anyone at coast with binoculars), 2) Different star constellations visible from different hemispheres (try seeing Southern Cross from Canada), 3) Time zones exist because Earth rotates (sun can't be overhead everywhere simultaneously on flat plane), 4) Lunar eclipses show round Earth shadow on moon (only sphere casts round shadow from all angles), 5) Circumnavigation possible - travel continuously east or west and return to start, 6) Satellite imagery from multiple nations showing spherical Earth, 7) Photos from ISS (visible to naked eye crossing sky), 8) Gravity measurements consistent with spherical mass distribution, 9) Foucault pendulum demonstrates Earth's rotation, 10) Coriolis effect visible in weather patterns, ocean currents, 11) Eratosthenes calculated Earth's circumference in 240 BCE using stick shadows at different latitudes, 12) Modern GPS requires accounting for Earth's curvature - wouldn't work on flat plane, 13) Airplane flight paths and times make sense on globe but not flat map, 14) Seasons caused by Earth's axial tilt relative to sun, 15) Antarctic expeditions by multiple nations confirming continent isn't ice wall, 16) Amateur high-altitude balloon launches showing curvature at 100,000+ feet, 17) Horizon dip angle increases with altitude predictably for sphere. Evidence is not only abundant but replicable - anyone can personally verify many observations. Scientific consensus isn't maintained by absence of evidence but by overwhelming consistency of observations across all fields: astronomy, navigation, physics, geology, meteorology. Blank paper represents not absence of evidence, but flat Earthers' refusal to accept evidence. Psychological phenomenon: when beliefs are identity-based rather than evidence-based, contrary evidence gets dismissed or reinterpreted. Blank list meme allows believers to feel intellectually superior - "mainstream has nothing" - while avoiding engagement with actual extensive evidence. Format is rhetorical propaganda rather than logical argument.15:T156e,Burj Khalifa curvature comparison meme questioning visibility of Earth's curve at 2,722 feet altitude. Three-panel infographic arguing Earth's curvature should be visible from Burj Khalifa if MythBusters' claims about curvature visibility are accurate. Layout presents evidence comparison suggesting contradiction. Top section split into two side-by-side panels showing airplane window views from high altitude. Left panel: photograph through aircraft window showing airplane wing in lower right corner, horizon line cutting across center, curved Earth horizon visible with thin blue atmospheric band separating Earth's surface from black space above. Overlay text "@67,400 FT" indicates altitude. Right panel: similar airplane window photograph showing wing, horizon with visible curvature, atmospheric glow. Overlay text "@70,000 FT" indicates altitude. Both images show characteristic high-altitude views - dark sky above transitioning through atmospheric gradient to Earth surface below. Curvature appears as gentle arc across horizon. Middle section shows text on light blue background in dark gray/black font: "According to Mythbusters, we should be able to see a curve going up a mere 2500 feet." Word "2500 feet" appears in red for emphasis. Statement references MythBusters TV show episode examining Earth curvature visibility. Bottom section shows large aerial photograph taken from extreme height looking down at urban/suburban landscape. Image displays bird's-eye view of developed area with buildings, roads, infrastructure creating geometric patterns. Straight red line drawn horizontally across image at midpoint representing horizon line or reference level. Perspective shows landscape extending to horizon in all directions. Text overlay at bottom in white letters: "This photo is from the top of the Burj Khalifa." Second line: "It measures 2722 feet high." emphasizing altitude. Number "2722" appears in red matching emphasis color. Third line poses rhetorical question: "Where's the curvature?" - suggesting curvature should be visible but isn't. Lower left shows "fb.com/oierreeplana" attribution. Burj Khalifa in Dubai is world's tallest building at 2,722 feet (829.8 meters) to architectural top. Meme's argument: MythBusters claimed curvature visible at 2,500 feet altitude, Burj Khalifa exceeds that at 2,722 feet, yet photograph from top shows flat horizon, therefore either MythBusters wrong or Earth is flat. However, argument contains fundamental misunderstanding of scale and geometry. Scientific reality: Earth's curvature at 2,500-2,700 feet altitude is geometrically minuscule - horizon drops approximately 0.5 degrees over visible distance. At this altitude, observer's horizon extends roughly 64 miles, and Earth's curvature over that distance creates drop of approximately 2,700 feet (equal to observer altitude) - but this is spread across 64-mile circle, creating extremely gentle arc imperceptible to human eye as distinct curve. Visible "horizon line" appears straight because field of view captures small arc segment. MythBusters episode (if accurately referenced) likely discussed curvature becoming theoretically measurable at certain altitudes with precise instruments, not necessarily visible to naked eye as obvious curve. Human eye perception of curvature requires either: 1) Very wide field of view capturing significant arc portion (fish-eye lens effect), 2) Higher altitude where arc becomes more pronounced (typically 35,000+ feet for subtle perception, 60,000+ feet for clear perception). Airplane window photos at 67,000-70,000 feet show curvature because altitude is 25-30x higher than Burj Khalifa, greatly increasing visible arc. Additionally, those photos may use wide-angle lenses naturally showing more curvature. Calculation: At 2,722 feet altitude, horizon distance = √(2 × radius × height) = √(2 × 3,959 miles × 0.515 miles) = √4,077 = 64 miles. Over 64-mile radius circle, Earth curves such that far side of visible circle is ~2,722 feet lower than observer (equal to altitude), but this creates gentle arc not straight drop. Angular subtense of this curvature across observer's field of view (typically 60-90 degrees) is fraction of degree - below threshold for perception as curved line versus straight line. Red line drawn across bottom photograph is itself suspicious - appears to be added digitally to emphasize "straight" horizon, but such lines can create illusion of flatness even on gently curved surface by averaging across arc. Meme selectively compares incomparable conditions: ultra-high altitude airplane views showing curvature to much lower building view where curvature is geometrically negligible. This is false equivalency fallacy. Proper comparison would be: Burj Khalifa view vs airplane at equivalent 2,700 feet altitude (also showing apparently flat horizon), or high-altitude airplane vs spacecraft at similar altitude both showing curvature. MythBusters reference may be misquoted or taken out of context. Show known for rigorous testing and explaining scientific principles accurately. If they discussed 2,500 feet, likely referred to theoretical measurability with instruments, not obvious visibility. Meme's rhetorical strategy exploits scale misunderstanding to create apparent contradiction where none exists. Effective propaganda because requires understanding of geometry, perspective, and scale to debunk - casual viewer sees "simple" contradiction suggesting conspiracy or error.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-349","title":"Other 349","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806013_470535606479512_6280776372523264957_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-348","title":"Other 348","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12805916_471298773069862_3171689689267286590_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-350","title":"Other 350","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12806165_472737672925972_4414938429678510550_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
