5:T14ce,Neil deGrasse Tyson pear-shaped Earth visual pun meme with actual pears. Professional portrait photograph of astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson modified with text to mock his statement about Earth being pear-shaped. Image shows formal studio portrait with clean gradient background - teal-green-blue gradient fading from darker at edges to lighter in center creating professional headshot aesthetic. Tyson sits facing camera in relaxed but dignified pose - body slightly turned, upper body and hands visible. He wears formal business attire: dark navy blue three-piece suit (jacket, vest, trousers) with crisp white dress shirt and distinctive necktie featuring space/astronomy theme - tie shows dark blue background with nebula patterns, stars, cosmic imagery appropriate for renowned astrophysicist. Suit fits well showing professional tailoring. Tyson's hands positioned holding white dinner plate at waist/chest level presenting contents toward camera. On plate sit three green pears - Bartlett or Anjou pears with characteristic pyriform (pear) shape, green-yellow skin showing natural coloring and subtle brown spotting, stems still attached pointing upward. Pears arranged artfully on plate creating still-life composition. Tyson's facial expression shows slight knowing smile with raised eyebrows suggesting amusement or playfulness - expression could be interpreted as presenting something significant or offering pears literally. His distinctive features visible: mustache, goatee, characteristic friendly demeanor. Professional studio lighting illuminates subject evenly with soft shadows. Text overlay at top in large sans-serif font: "FLAT EARTH MATTERS" in light gray or white letters creating title/context. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Visual pun operates on multiple levels: 1) Tyson famously stated Earth is "pear-shaped" referring to scientific fact that Earth is oblate spheroid (flattened at poles, bulging at equator due to rotation) with additional asymmetry where Southern Hemisphere's equatorial bulge is slightly larger than Northern Hemisphere's (measured difference of ~20 meters). Term "pear-shaped" caused public confusion suggesting dramatic fruit-like shape rather than subtle 0.000003% deviation from perfect oblate spheroid. 2) Meme takes Tyson's technical statement literally by showing him holding actual pears - visual joke suggesting if Earth is "pear-shaped" according to scientist, here are pears to represent it. Mockery suggests claim is absurd by literalizing metaphor. 3) Flat Earth community frequently targets Tyson (along with Bill Nye) as prominent science communicators defending mainstream cosmology. His pear-Earth statement became focal point for mockery because awkward phrasing made accurate science sound ridiculous to lay audience. Presenting actual pears frames scientific statement as nonsensical. However, Tyson's statement was scientifically accurate: precise measurements from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites show Earth's equatorial bulge is asymmetric - equatorial radius at Southern Hemisphere approximately 20 meters greater than Northern Hemisphere at equatorial plane. This deviation from perfect oblate spheroid creates very slight "pear" asymmetry. Difference is real, measurable, and scientifically significant for understanding Earth's mass distribution and gravitational field variations, though imperceptible to naked eye from space. Earth's oblateness itself (polar vs equatorial diameter difference of 43 km out of 12,742 km diameter = 0.33%) results from centrifugal force due to rotation - fundamental physics principle. Tyson's use of "pear-shaped" was popularization attempt to explain technical concept to general audience, but backfired by creating misleading mental image. Better description: "very slightly asymmetric oblate spheroid." Meme's humor exploits communication failure - technically correct statement that sounds absurd when taken literally. Photograph appears to be manipulated - Tyson likely photographed for different purpose, pears digitally added or composite created. His expression and body language suggest formal portrait rather than deliberately posing with pears. Professional photography quality and composition indicate stock portrait or publicity photo. Effectiveness in flat Earth communities stems from: 1) Ridiculing prominent science advocate, 2) Suggesting mainstream scientists make obviously ridiculous claims, 3) Implies globe Earth model is inconsistent ("first it's sphere, then oblate spheroid, now pear-shaped - make up your mind"), 4) Visual humor makes message shareable and memorable. Irony: meme mocks accurate science by presenting literal interpretation of metaphor, while flat Earth model contradicts overwhelming evidence from navigation, astronomy, physics. Tyson has addressed pear-Earth controversy multiple times, clarifying measurement precision and explaining why Earth's shape deviates slightly from perfect sphere while emphasizing overall sphericity. Scientific understanding requires precision - Earth is sphere to first approximation, oblate spheroid to second approximation, asymmetric oblate spheroid to third approximation. Each refinement represents increased measurement precision, not contradiction of previous understanding.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 349 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Neil deGrasse Tyson pear-shaped Earth visual pun meme with actual pears.
