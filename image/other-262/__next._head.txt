5:T6a5,Sea level versus sea curve meme arguing oceans appear flat. Two-panel comparison photograph claiming water surfaces show no curvature. Top panel shows ocean scene with text 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in large black sans-serif font. Image displays expansive ocean view with dark blue water in foreground showing gentle wave texture and ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level across middle of frame. Small two-masted sailboat visible as dark silhouette on horizon slightly left of center - boat appears upright with both masts visible. Sky above shows light blue color near horizon transitioning to brighter turquoise-cyan at top with wispy white clouds. Water surface appears flat and level extending to horizon. Bottom panel shows identical or very similar photograph with text 'NOT SEA CURVE' in same black font. Image nearly identical to top - same dark blue rippled ocean water, same straight horizon line, same small sailboat in same position, same light blue sky with clouds. Panels demonstrate that from observer's perspective on beach or ship, horizon appears straight and flat, not curved. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with 8 inches per mile squared curvature, curve should be visible across ocean. However, on sphere with 12,742 km diameter, curvature is imperceptible at human scale. To see 8 inches of drop, must observe over 1 mile distance. To see noticeable curve, need hundreds of miles of view from significant altitude. At sea level looking at horizon 3-5 miles away, curvature is too subtle for human eye. Horizon always appears level because it represents circle of equal distance around observer - even on sphere, local horizon appears as straight line0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 262 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Sea level versus sea curve meme arguing oceans appear flat.
