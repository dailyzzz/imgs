3:T6a5,Sea level versus sea curve meme arguing oceans appear flat. Two-panel comparison photograph claiming water surfaces show no curvature. Top panel shows ocean scene with text 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in large black sans-serif font. Image displays expansive ocean view with dark blue water in foreground showing gentle wave texture and ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level across middle of frame. Small two-masted sailboat visible as dark silhouette on horizon slightly left of center - boat appears upright with both masts visible. Sky above shows light blue color near horizon transitioning to brighter turquoise-cyan at top with wispy white clouds. Water surface appears flat and level extending to horizon. Bottom panel shows identical or very similar photograph with text 'NOT SEA CURVE' in same black font. Image nearly identical to top - same dark blue rippled ocean water, same straight horizon line, same small sailboat in same position, same light blue sky with clouds. Panels demonstrate that from observer's perspective on beach or ship, horizon appears straight and flat, not curved. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with 8 inches per mile squared curvature, curve should be visible across ocean. However, on sphere with 12,742 km diameter, curvature is imperceptible at human scale. To see 8 inches of drop, must observe over 1 mile distance. To see noticeable curve, need hundreds of miles of view from significant altitude. At sea level looking at horizon 3-5 miles away, curvature is too subtle for human eye. Horizon always appears level because it represents circle of equal distance around observer - even on sphere, local horizon appears as straight line4:T5ea,Aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting ocean water. Shows striking natural boundary between ice and sea in polar region. Left side of image displays dark navy-blue ocean water with slightly rippled surface showing wave texture and occasional white specks suggesting floating ice fragments, sea foam, or atmospheric particles. Water appears deep and cold. Center features dramatic irregular ice edge - thick white and light blue glacial ice forming natural cliff or wall where ice shelf meets ocean. Edge shows jagged, uneven formation with vertical face where ice has broken or calved. Ice surface appears textured with rough, crystalline structure. Transition zone between ice and water shows light blue-white coloring where ice meets sea. Right side shows ice shelf surface extending into distance - bright white snow and ice covering with pale gray-blue sky above. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations. Sky shows overcast or hazy conditions typical of polar environments. Photograph likely taken from aircraft or drone looking down at approximately 30-45 degree angle. Image captures stark beauty of Antarctic landscape and ongoing process of ice shelf dynamics where glacial ice continuously breaks off into ocean. No text visible. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter, though this shows typical ice shelf calving process occurring throughout Antarctic coastline. Image demonstrates natural glacial processes at edge of continent5:T78d,Science versus pseudoscience comparison chart from Flat Earth Matters. Educational infographic contrasting scientific method with pseudoscientific approaches on black background. Title at top in large white and cyan text: 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Two columns separated by vertical line - left column labeled 'SCIENCE' in white, right column labeled 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' in italicized cyan. Nine bullet points in each column using triangular bullet markers. SCIENCE column (white text): 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. PSEUDOSCIENCE column (cyan text): 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm.', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence.', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence.', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic.', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'Flat Earth Matters' in large white text. Ironic that Flat Earth community shares this chart claiming mainstream science exhibits pseudoscience characteristics while their approach follows true science. However, flat Earth methodology demonstrates classic pseudoscience: starts with conclusion (Earth is flat), hostile to criticism, cherry-picks evidence (ignoring ships disappearing over horizon, satellite communications, circumnavigation), uses flawed experiments, works in isolation from scientific community, dogmatic refusal to accept contradictory evidence. Chart accurately describes scientific method versus conspiracy theory thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-262","title":"Other 262","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12715417_465950130271393_8854944052571313820_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-261","title":"Other 261","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12710947_461770347356038_3681852479021078351_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-263","title":"Other 263","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12715437_462310933968646_1713054839718788751_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
