5:T1b22,Four-panel collage showing tall buildings and antenna towers asking "What if satellites are really ground based?" Flat Earth meme suggesting all communications attributed to satellites actually come from ground-based infrastructure like cell towers, skyscrapers, and transmission antennas. IMAGE LAYOUT: Four photographs arranged in 2x2 grid showing various tall structures with telecommunications equipment on top. TOP LEFT PANEL: Burj Khalifa in Dubai - world's tallest building (828m/2,717ft). Distinctive tapered spire design visible. Silver/gray metallic exterior reflecting sunlight. Communication antenna visible at top of spire. Building extends dramatically upward against blue sky with scattered clouds. City skyline visible in background. TOP RIGHT PANEL: One World Trade Center in New York City (Freedom Tower). Distinctive angular glass facade reflecting blue sky. Communication spire/antenna at top. Modern skyscraper architecture against blue sky with white clouds. Upper portion of building visible showing glass curtain wall construction. BOTTOM LEFT PANEL: Person (appears to be urban explorer/photographer) sitting on top of extremely tall structure - possibly skyscraper or industrial tower. Urban cityscape visible far below creating dramatic height perspective. Person casually sitting on edge demonstrating extreme altitude. City extends to horizon in all directions. Dusty/hazy atmospheric conditions. Middle Eastern city based on architecture - possibly Dubai. BOTTOM RIGHT PANEL: Rooftop cellular/telecommunications installation on commercial building. Multiple antenna arrays visible - various shapes and configurations. Cylindrical antennas and panel arrays typical of cell tower equipment. Building rooftop with HVAC equipment and antenna mounting structures. Urban setting with other buildings visible in background. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text (white Impact font): "WHAT IF SATELLITES" - Sets up provocative question. Bottom text (white Impact font): "ARE REALLY GROUND BASED?" - Completes question suggesting satellites don't exist and ground infrastructure does their job. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible in bottom left. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SATELLITES DON'T EXIST: In flat Earth model, space is fake and satellites cannot exist. All communications, GPS, TV, internet attributed to "satellites" actually come from ground-based infrastructure. 2) TOWERS DO THE WORK: Tall buildings and transmission towers provide line-of-sight coverage. Network of ground stations connected by cables and relays explains all "satellite" services. Cell towers, radio towers, undersea cables handle all communications without need for orbital infrastructure. 3) GPS FROM GROUND: GPS supposedly works through triangulation from ground towers, not orbital satellites. Military LORAN system (ground-based) proves ground navigation is possible. "Satellite" GPS is just rebranded ground system. 4) HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: Image suggests truth is obvious - look at all these towers and antennas! Why so much ground infrastructure if satellites do the work? Answer: Satellites don't exist; towers are the real system. TECHNICAL REALITY: 1) DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES: Just like with broadcast towers, satellites and ground infrastructure serve complementary purposes - not competing ones. Cell towers: Short-range local coverage. Fiber optic cables: Long-distance high-bandwidth connections. Radio towers: Local broadcast transmission. Satellites: Global coverage, GPS, weather, remote area communication. All are needed because each excels at different applications. 2) GPS REQUIRES SATELLITES: GPS mathematically requires multiple simultaneous signals from known positions to triangulate location. Ground-based systems cannot provide global coverage - Earth's curvature blocks line-of-sight from ground stations beyond horizon. LORAN (ground-based) had limited range and accuracy compared to satellite GPS. GPS satellites orbit at 20,200 km altitude - visible from large portions of Earth simultaneously. 3) SATELLITE TV DISHES PROVE SATELLITES: Satellite TV dishes point at specific positions in sky - geostationary satellites at ~35,786 km altitude. Dishes must be precisely aimed at correct satellite position. Position changes by location on Earth - different aiming for different latitudes/longitudes. If signals came from ground towers, dishes would point at horizon, not sky. You can verify satellite positions with tracking apps and see dishes worldwide pointing at same orbital slots. 4) AMATEUR RADIO SATELLITE CONTACTS: Ham radio operators bounce signals off satellites routinely. Track satellite passes and make contacts during brief overhead windows. Timing matches orbital predictions exactly - satellites move across sky in predictable paths. Anyone with amateur radio license can verify satellites exist through direct personal experience. 5) VISUAL SATELLITE TRACKING: ISS visible to naked eye crossing night sky. Hundreds of satellites visible with binoculars. Starlink satellite trains visible as strings of lights crossing sky. Movement matches predicted orbital paths precisely. You can predict when satellites will be visible and watch them pass exactly as calculated. GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSE: Images show legitimate ground infrastructure that DOES handle much communication: Burj Khalifa: Has cellular antennas for local coverage - building's occupants and nearby area. One World Trade Center: Broadcasting antennas serve local TV/radio - not replacing satellites. Rooftop antennas: Cell tower serving few-mile radius - cannot reach satellites' global coverage. These exist BECAUSE satellites cannot provide localized cellular service effectively. Different tools for different jobs. FALSE DICHOTOMY: Meme presents false either/or choice: Either satellites exist OR ground infrastructure exists. Reality: Both exist, serving different complementary purposes. Ground infrastructure's existence doesn't disprove satellites any more than existence of roads disproves airplanes. VISUAL RHETORIC: Impressive tall buildings and dramatic heights create engaging imagery. Tower-top antennas visible in all photos (even if serving different purposes). Question format invites viewer to "discover" hidden truth. Assumes viewer doesn't understand telecommunications infrastructure. Works for audiences already primed to distrust official explanations. WEAKNESS: Anyone in telecommunications industry immediately recognizes different equipment types serving different purposes. Satellite dishes visible on same buildings point at sky, not ground towers. Personal experience with GPS, satellite TV, satellite internet contradicts "ground-based" claim. Images don't show evidence satellites are fake - just show ground infrastructure exists (which nobody disputes). False premise: Nobody claims ground infrastructure doesn't exist - question is whether satellites ALSO exist (which they demonstrably do).0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 391 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Four-panel collage showing tall buildings and antenna towers asking \"What if satellites are really ground based?\" Flat Earth meme suggesting all communicatio..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Other 391"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Four-panel collage showing tall buildings and antenna towers asking \"What if satellites are really ground based?\" Flat Earth meme suggesting all communicatio..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/other/12967556_486258038240602_8871969624288831214_o.jpg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],"$L6","$L7","$L8","$L9","$La"]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
