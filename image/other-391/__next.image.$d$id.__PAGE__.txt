3:T1b22,Four-panel collage showing tall buildings and antenna towers asking "What if satellites are really ground based?" Flat Earth meme suggesting all communications attributed to satellites actually come from ground-based infrastructure like cell towers, skyscrapers, and transmission antennas. IMAGE LAYOUT: Four photographs arranged in 2x2 grid showing various tall structures with telecommunications equipment on top. TOP LEFT PANEL: Burj Khalifa in Dubai - world's tallest building (828m/2,717ft). Distinctive tapered spire design visible. Silver/gray metallic exterior reflecting sunlight. Communication antenna visible at top of spire. Building extends dramatically upward against blue sky with scattered clouds. City skyline visible in background. TOP RIGHT PANEL: One World Trade Center in New York City (Freedom Tower). Distinctive angular glass facade reflecting blue sky. Communication spire/antenna at top. Modern skyscraper architecture against blue sky with white clouds. Upper portion of building visible showing glass curtain wall construction. BOTTOM LEFT PANEL: Person (appears to be urban explorer/photographer) sitting on top of extremely tall structure - possibly skyscraper or industrial tower. Urban cityscape visible far below creating dramatic height perspective. Person casually sitting on edge demonstrating extreme altitude. City extends to horizon in all directions. Dusty/hazy atmospheric conditions. Middle Eastern city based on architecture - possibly Dubai. BOTTOM RIGHT PANEL: Rooftop cellular/telecommunications installation on commercial building. Multiple antenna arrays visible - various shapes and configurations. Cylindrical antennas and panel arrays typical of cell tower equipment. Building rooftop with HVAC equipment and antenna mounting structures. Urban setting with other buildings visible in background. TEXT OVERLAY: Top text (white Impact font): "WHAT IF SATELLITES" - Sets up provocative question. Bottom text (white Impact font): "ARE REALLY GROUND BASED?" - Completes question suggesting satellites don't exist and ground infrastructure does their job. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible in bottom left. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SATELLITES DON'T EXIST: In flat Earth model, space is fake and satellites cannot exist. All communications, GPS, TV, internet attributed to "satellites" actually come from ground-based infrastructure. 2) TOWERS DO THE WORK: Tall buildings and transmission towers provide line-of-sight coverage. Network of ground stations connected by cables and relays explains all "satellite" services. Cell towers, radio towers, undersea cables handle all communications without need for orbital infrastructure. 3) GPS FROM GROUND: GPS supposedly works through triangulation from ground towers, not orbital satellites. Military LORAN system (ground-based) proves ground navigation is possible. "Satellite" GPS is just rebranded ground system. 4) HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: Image suggests truth is obvious - look at all these towers and antennas! Why so much ground infrastructure if satellites do the work? Answer: Satellites don't exist; towers are the real system. TECHNICAL REALITY: 1) DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES: Just like with broadcast towers, satellites and ground infrastructure serve complementary purposes - not competing ones. Cell towers: Short-range local coverage. Fiber optic cables: Long-distance high-bandwidth connections. Radio towers: Local broadcast transmission. Satellites: Global coverage, GPS, weather, remote area communication. All are needed because each excels at different applications. 2) GPS REQUIRES SATELLITES: GPS mathematically requires multiple simultaneous signals from known positions to triangulate location. Ground-based systems cannot provide global coverage - Earth's curvature blocks line-of-sight from ground stations beyond horizon. LORAN (ground-based) had limited range and accuracy compared to satellite GPS. GPS satellites orbit at 20,200 km altitude - visible from large portions of Earth simultaneously. 3) SATELLITE TV DISHES PROVE SATELLITES: Satellite TV dishes point at specific positions in sky - geostationary satellites at ~35,786 km altitude. Dishes must be precisely aimed at correct satellite position. Position changes by location on Earth - different aiming for different latitudes/longitudes. If signals came from ground towers, dishes would point at horizon, not sky. You can verify satellite positions with tracking apps and see dishes worldwide pointing at same orbital slots. 4) AMATEUR RADIO SATELLITE CONTACTS: Ham radio operators bounce signals off satellites routinely. Track satellite passes and make contacts during brief overhead windows. Timing matches orbital predictions exactly - satellites move across sky in predictable paths. Anyone with amateur radio license can verify satellites exist through direct personal experience. 5) VISUAL SATELLITE TRACKING: ISS visible to naked eye crossing night sky. Hundreds of satellites visible with binoculars. Starlink satellite trains visible as strings of lights crossing sky. Movement matches predicted orbital paths precisely. You can predict when satellites will be visible and watch them pass exactly as calculated. GROUND INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSE: Images show legitimate ground infrastructure that DOES handle much communication: Burj Khalifa: Has cellular antennas for local coverage - building's occupants and nearby area. One World Trade Center: Broadcasting antennas serve local TV/radio - not replacing satellites. Rooftop antennas: Cell tower serving few-mile radius - cannot reach satellites' global coverage. These exist BECAUSE satellites cannot provide localized cellular service effectively. Different tools for different jobs. FALSE DICHOTOMY: Meme presents false either/or choice: Either satellites exist OR ground infrastructure exists. Reality: Both exist, serving different complementary purposes. Ground infrastructure's existence doesn't disprove satellites any more than existence of roads disproves airplanes. VISUAL RHETORIC: Impressive tall buildings and dramatic heights create engaging imagery. Tower-top antennas visible in all photos (even if serving different purposes). Question format invites viewer to "discover" hidden truth. Assumes viewer doesn't understand telecommunications infrastructure. Works for audiences already primed to distrust official explanations. WEAKNESS: Anyone in telecommunications industry immediately recognizes different equipment types serving different purposes. Satellite dishes visible on same buildings point at sky, not ground towers. Personal experience with GPS, satellite TV, satellite internet contradicts "ground-based" claim. Images don't show evidence satellites are fake - just show ground infrastructure exists (which nobody disputes). False premise: Nobody claims ground infrastructure doesn't exist - question is whether satellites ALSO exist (which they demonstrably do).4:T1a25,Green screen studio setup with ISS model and film crew, overlaid with NASA "loss of signal" message to mock space agency's technical interruptions as evidence of faked space footage. Flat Earth propaganda image combining behind-the-scenes filmmaking photograph with official NASA text to suggest ISS footage is studio production rather than actual space station coverage. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Satirical composite combining two elements - photograph of green screen film production and overlaid text resembling NASA broadcast messages. IMAGE BACKGROUND - GREEN SCREEN SET: Bright green chroma key background filling most of frame - standard film/video production technique allowing background replacement in post-production. Large professional film studio space visible. Lighting equipment visible on left side - white reflector or diffuser panel on stand. Ladder/scaffolding visible on left - typical studio equipment for reaching high angles. FILM CREW MEMBER: Person visible on right side of frame standing on raised platform/box. Male crew member wearing casual clothes - checkered shirt, dark vest/harness. Arm raised overhead - appears to be adjusting or holding equipment. "JM" marking visible on equipment/box - likely production department identifier. Professional film worker positioning equipment or rigging for shot. ISS MODEL: Central focus of image - detailed model of International Space Station suspended in middle of green screen. Model shows characteristic ISS features: Central truss structure, Multiple solar panel arrays extending from sides, Various modules and components visible, Detailed enough for convincing camera shots, Appears to be high-quality miniature used for visual effects. Model suspended from above by wire/cable visible at top of frame. Standard special effects technique for creating "floating in space" imagery. TEXT OVERLAY: Official-looking text in center reads: "Please stand by. We are either switching cameras, or we are experiencing a temporary loss of signal with the International Space Station." This text mimics genuine NASA TV messages displayed during broadcast interruptions. Text formatted to look like official NASA communication. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible at bottom. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) ISS FAKED IN STUDIO: Image suggests NASA creates ISS footage using models against green screens in film studios. "Loss of signal" messages are allegedly cover for switching between camera angles or fixing production issues - not actual communication problems with real space station. 2) WHY "LOSS OF SIGNAL" HAPPENS: Flat Earthers interpret broadcast interruptions as evidence of fakery: Real space station would have continuous coverage capability. Interruptions occur when "actors" need breaks or set changes are needed. "Technical difficulties" are convenient excuses for editing fake footage together. 3) GREEN SCREEN EVIDENCE: Occasional video artifacts, compression glitches, or hair movement on ISS are cited as "green screen errors" proving studio filming. Any perceived visual anomaly becomes evidence of fakery rather than normal video compression/transmission issues. SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE: 1) LOSS OF SIGNAL IS REAL: ISS orbits Earth every 90 minutes, passing through zones where communication satellites don't provide coverage. Signal loss occurs when ISS is in "zone of exclusion" between communication satellite coverage areas. Also occurs during orbital maneuvers, antenna repositioning, or actual equipment issues. Loss of signal is predicted, expected, and documented - not suspicious. 2) YOU CAN TRACK ISS YOURSELF: ISS visible to naked eye as it passes overhead - one of brightest objects in night sky. Tracking websites/apps show exact position matching predictions based on orbital mechanics. Amateur astronomers photograph ISS showing solar panels, modules, even docked spacecraft. Ham radio operators communicate directly with ISS astronauts. Anyone can verify ISS exists independently of NASA. 3) MULTIPLE NATIONS INVOLVED: ISS is international project involving NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), CSA (Canada). Would require unprecedented international conspiracy among rival nations to maintain fake station. Russia and USA were Cold War enemies - why would they cooperate on decades-long hoax? 4) CONTINUOUS LIVE FEEDS: NASA provides nearly continuous live video from ISS showing Earth rotation, day/night cycles, weather systems - all matching real-time conditions. Live feed shows ISS orbital path matching predicted trajectory. Would require impossibly complex real-time CGI to fake Earth conditions matching actual weather worldwide. 5) PRIVATE COMPANIES NOW VISIT: SpaceX, Boeing have docked spacecraft with ISS. Private astronauts have visited. Would require ever-expanding conspiracy to include private sector. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos would need to be complicit in space hoax while publicly competing for space business. IMAGE SOURCE: Green screen photograph appears to be from legitimate film/TV production - possibly behind-the-scenes from science fiction production, commercial shoot, or documentary recreation. ISS model likely from visual effects work for educational content or entertainment. Flat Earth community combined unrelated filmmaking photo with NASA-style text to create propaganda image suggesting NASA uses similar techniques. Original photo has nothing to do with NASA or ISS - repurposed for conspiracy content. VISUAL RHETORIC: Image is effective because: Shows real film production techniques (green screen, models, lighting). Juxtaposes with NASA-style official text. Creates association between filmmaking and NASA. Invites viewer to conclude: "So THAT'S how they do it!" Format makes claim visually compelling without providing actual evidence NASA uses these techniques. IMAGE LIMITATIONS: 1) Doesn't prove NASA fakes ISS - just shows that green screen technology exists (which everyone knows). 2) Model quality shown is lower than actual ISS footage quality. 3) Modern ISS "exterior" shots are from cameras mounted ON ISS, not models. 4) Ignores massive evidence for real ISS including amateur verification. 5) Conspiracy would require thousands of people across multiple nations maintaining perfect secrecy for decades - implausible. PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUE: Classic "proof by suggestion" - showing filmmaking equipment and ISS-related text creates implied connection without explicit false claim. Viewer draws own conclusion that NASA uses these techniques. Technically image doesn't "lie" - it just creates misleading juxtaposition. Effective for audiences already suspicious of NASA; easily dismissed by anyone familiar with ISS verification methods.5:T1e99,Globe illustration with world landmarks wishing for 2016 to be "the year when people remembered that science is a method of investigation and not a belief system." Flat Earth meme appropriating scientific skepticism language to position flat Earth as legitimate inquiry versus mainstream science as dogmatic belief. IMAGE COMPOSITION: Artistic globe illustration with famous landmarks positioned around Earth, combined with motivational New Year's wish text criticizing mainstream science as belief system. CENTRAL GLOBE: Stylized spherical Earth illustration showing continents and oceans. Blue planet representation with recognizable continental shapes. Clouds/atmosphere visible around globe. Artistic rendering rather than photographic image. Ironically uses globe illustration in flat Earth content - though image criticizes mainstream science, not specifically globe Earth shape. WORLD LANDMARKS: Famous structures positioned around globe as if standing on surface: STATUE OF LIBERTY (New York, USA): Green copper statue visible on left side. Classic torch-bearing figure representing American liberty. LEANING TOWER OF PISA (Italy): Distinctive tilted white marble tower. Medieval Italian architecture landmark. BIG BEN/ELIZABETH TOWER (London, UK): Iconic clock tower from UK Parliament. Gothic Revival architecture style. EIFFEL TOWER (Paris, France): Iron lattice tower, most famous Parisian landmark. SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE: Distinctive shell-shaped roof structure visible. Landmarks represent global human achievement and civilization - suggests worldwide scope of discussion about science. AIRPLANE: Commercial aircraft flying across top of image. Suggests international travel and modern technology. Also represents aerial perspective of Earth. SKY BACKGROUND: Blue sky with white clouds. Bright, optimistic atmospheric conditions. Suggests clarity, openness, enlightenment. TEXT CONTENT: TOP TEXT: "I WOULD LIKE 2016 TO BE THE YEAR" - New Year's wish format (image dated from 2016 based on Facebook timestamp pattern). RIGHT SIDE TEXT: "When people remembered that science is a method of investigation," - First part of core message. BOTTOM TEXT: "AND NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM" - Conclusion of argument. "fb.com/fematters" attribution visible. FLAT EARTH ARGUMENT: 1) SCIENCE IS METHOD, NOT DOGMA: Image appropriates valid philosophical point - science IS a method (hypothesis, testing, revision) not a fixed set of conclusions. Flat Earthers argue that mainstream "scientists" treat conclusions (spherical Earth, evolution, etc.) as sacred beliefs rather than testable hypotheses. Calling something "science" doesn't make it true - only evidence and testing do. 2) SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT AS RELIGION: Implication is that modern science has become faith-based belief system where questioning established conclusions is treated as heresy. Scientists who challenge consensus face career consequences. Peer review becomes enforcement mechanism for orthodoxy. Scientific "consensus" is appeal to authority, not evidence. 3) FLAT EARTH AS TRUE SKEPTICISM: If science is method, then everything should be open to question - including Earth's shape. Flat Earthers claim they're applying scientific method by questioning assumptions. Demanding evidence for globe Earth is what scientists SHOULD do. Those who refuse to question globe are being religious, not scientific. 4) INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION: Image encourages people to investigate claims themselves rather than trust authorities. Don't believe Earth is round because scientists say so - test it yourself. Personal observation and experiment should override expert consensus. TRUE NATURE OF SCIENCE: While image makes superficially valid point (science IS method), it misrepresents how science actually works: 1) SCIENCE DOES QUESTION ASSUMPTIONS: Scientific paradigm shifts happen regularly (plate tectonics, quantum mechanics, relativity). Scientists who overturn established theories WIN Nobel Prizes, don't face persecution. Difference: Successful challenges come with BETTER EVIDENCE and PREDICTIONS, not just contrarianism. 2) CONSENSUS BASED ON EVIDENCE: Scientific consensus on Earth's shape isn't "belief" - it's conclusion from overwhelming convergent evidence. Consensus can change when evidence warrants - but requires evidence, not assertion. Globe Earth "consensus" is actually verified millions of times daily by navigation, aviation, telecommunications, astronomy. 3) EXPERTISE MATTERS: "Do your own research" sounds democratic but ignores that some questions require specialized knowledge. Amateur investigations without proper methodology often reach wrong conclusions. Dunning-Kruger effect: Less knowledge = more confidence in incorrect conclusions. 4) FALSIFIABILITY: Scientific claims must be falsifiable - and globe Earth IS testable and has survived every test. Flat Earth claims are NOT falsifiable - any evidence against them is dismissed as fake. Which approach is more "scientific"? FALSE EQUIVALENCE: Image creates false equivalence between: Flat Earth believers questioning everything (presented as scientific skepticism). Scientists accepting evidence-based conclusions (presented as religious faith). But: Accepting conclusions supported by vast evidence isn't "belief" - it's rational. Rejecting evidence to maintain preferred conclusion IS belief-based thinking. Flat Earth community rejects photographic evidence, physics, navigation, astronomy - that's dogmatism, not skepticism. APPROPRIATION OF SKEPTICISM: Flat Earth community strategically uses language of skepticism and scientific method while practicing opposite: Claim to question everything - but don't question flat Earth assumptions. Claim to want evidence - but reject all evidence for globe Earth as "fake." Claim to use scientific method - but don't conduct controlled experiments with proper methodology. Claim mainstream science is biased - but use extreme confirmation bias themselves. This isn't skepticism - it's selective doubt applied only to conclusions they dislike while accepting preferred conclusions uncritically. 2016 CONTEXT: Image appears to be from early 2016 based on "2016 to be the year" framing. 2016 saw significant growth in flat Earth community via YouTube and social media. "Post-truth" discourse and distrust of institutions was expanding. Image reflects moment when flat Earth movement was gaining mainstream attention. VISUAL RHETORIC: Globe with landmarks is aspirational, positive imagery - world civilization and human achievement. Motivational New Year's wish format feels optimistic, constructive. Message sounds reasonable without context - who could disagree that science is method? Clean, professional design suggests legitimate source. Doesn't explicitly mention flat Earth - works as gateway content attracting those skeptical of institutions before introducing specific flat Earth claims. EFFECTIVENESS: Image works because: Core claim (science = method) is technically true. Doesn't immediately reveal flat Earth agenda. Appeals to values most people share (questioning, evidence). Creates feeling of intellectual sophistication. Positions flat Earthers as true scientists, mainstream as dogmatists. Effective entry point for flat Earth recruitment - agree with reasonable premise, then accept flat Earth conclusions as logical extension. IRONY: Image uses globe illustration to criticize "belief" in globe Earth. Calls for questioning assumptions while assuming flat Earth without evidence. Demands scientific method while flat Earth fails basic scientific testing. Claims others are dogmatic while flat Earth community rejects all contrary evidence. Meta-irony: Message about science being method (not belief) is correct - and when properly applied to flat Earth claim, scientific method conclusively demonstrates Earth is spherical.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-391","title":"Other 391","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12967556_486258038240602_8871969624288831214_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-390","title":"Other 390","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12967453_489106497955756_1709119393798707059_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-392","title":"Other 392","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12973038_488663814666691_6263949441578117412_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
