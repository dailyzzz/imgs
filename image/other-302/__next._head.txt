5:T883,Astronaut spacewalk with 'It's all FAKE' sign composite. Manipulated photograph showing astronaut during EVA holding sign claiming space activities are fabricated. Image shows astronaut in full white Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit performing spacewalk outside spacecraft. Astronaut's gold-tinted reflective helmet visor visible showing reflection of another astronaut/photographer and spacecraft components. White spacesuit shows various equipment: chest-mounted control panel with switches/displays, safety tethers, communication equipment, American flag patch visible. Astronaut's gloved hands hold white rectangular sign/card with handwritten text in black marker: 'It's all FAKE' in casual script lettering. Background shows Earth's curved surface below with brilliant white cloud formations against deep blue ocean, confirming high-altitude orbital perspective. Portions of spacecraft visible - white/silver metallic structures, cylindrical modules, solar panel edges with characteristic dark photovoltaic cells and gray structural supports. Earth's atmosphere visible as thin blue line along horizon. Deep black space beyond. Scene appears to be genuine ISS exterior activity photograph digitally altered to add sign. Meme suggests space program is hoax with astronaut ironically holding admission of fakery during supposedly fake spacewalk. However, image itself demonstrates why this is paradoxical - shows actual spacewalk photography with real orbital mechanics, Earth curvature, spacecraft hardware, proper lighting/shadows, atmospheric perspective. Hundreds of hours of EVA footage exist from multiple space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, CNSA) spanning decades with thousands of witnesses, live broadcasts, consistent physics. Sign is obvious digital insertion - astronauts don't carry props during dangerous technical spacewalks requiring both hands for safety and equipment operation. Real EVAs meticulously planned, every action choreographed. Carrying joke signs would violate safety protocols and mission objectives. Image is parody/satire possibly created by flat Earth skeptics mocking conspiracy theories, or by believers attempting dark humor0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 302 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Astronaut spacewalk with 'It's all FAKE' sign composite.
