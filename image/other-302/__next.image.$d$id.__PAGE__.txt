3:T883,Astronaut spacewalk with 'It's all FAKE' sign composite. Manipulated photograph showing astronaut during EVA holding sign claiming space activities are fabricated. Image shows astronaut in full white Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit performing spacewalk outside spacecraft. Astronaut's gold-tinted reflective helmet visor visible showing reflection of another astronaut/photographer and spacecraft components. White spacesuit shows various equipment: chest-mounted control panel with switches/displays, safety tethers, communication equipment, American flag patch visible. Astronaut's gloved hands hold white rectangular sign/card with handwritten text in black marker: 'It's all FAKE' in casual script lettering. Background shows Earth's curved surface below with brilliant white cloud formations against deep blue ocean, confirming high-altitude orbital perspective. Portions of spacecraft visible - white/silver metallic structures, cylindrical modules, solar panel edges with characteristic dark photovoltaic cells and gray structural supports. Earth's atmosphere visible as thin blue line along horizon. Deep black space beyond. Scene appears to be genuine ISS exterior activity photograph digitally altered to add sign. Meme suggests space program is hoax with astronaut ironically holding admission of fakery during supposedly fake spacewalk. However, image itself demonstrates why this is paradoxical - shows actual spacewalk photography with real orbital mechanics, Earth curvature, spacecraft hardware, proper lighting/shadows, atmospheric perspective. Hundreds of hours of EVA footage exist from multiple space agencies (NASA, Roscosmos, ESA, CNSA) spanning decades with thousands of witnesses, live broadcasts, consistent physics. Sign is obvious digital insertion - astronauts don't carry props during dangerous technical spacewalks requiring both hands for safety and equipment operation. Real EVAs meticulously planned, every action choreographed. Carrying joke signs would violate safety protocols and mission objectives. Image is parody/satire possibly created by flat Earth skeptics mocking conspiracy theories, or by believers attempting dark humor4:T96c,Conspiracy Keanu meme questioning satellite visibility in ISS footage. Two-panel meme using popular "Conspiracy Keanu" format to question satellite existence. Top section displays computer-generated visualization of satellites orbiting Earth viewed from space. Central Earth appears as blue-green sphere with white cloud patterns showing realistic continental outlines. Surrounding Earth in dense orbital shell are hundreds/thousands of small white dots/objects representing satellites in various orbital planes creating spherical envelope around planet. Background shows black space with scattered white stars. Dots concentrated in bands suggesting different orbital altitudes - some closer to surface (Low Earth Orbit), others further out (Medium/Geostationary orbits). Visualization dramatically depicts space debris/satellite population problem. Text overlay in white sans-serif font top center: 'EVERY SINGLE SATELLITE ORBITING THE EARTH'. Below in center: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom section shows Keanu Reeves in his famous "conspiracy Keanu" pose from scene looking upward with suspicious/confused expression. He has dark wavy/messy hair, wears light colored shirt/jacket, background shows blurred warm-toned outdoor setting. Top text continues: 'IF THERE ARE REALLY THAT MANY SATELLITES,'. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'THEN WHY DON'T WE SEE THEM IN ANY OF THE ISS VIDEOS?' Meme questions why thousands of satellites aren't visible in International Space Station footage if so many orbit Earth. However, several factors explain this: 1) Most satellites are small (size of refrigerator to bus), 2) Space is vast - even thousands of satellites spread across orbital shells spanning 200-36,000 km altitude means huge distances between objects, 3) Satellites move at different speeds in different orbits making simultaneous viewing unlikely, 4) ISS cameras typically point at Earth or into deep space, not lateral orbital plane where most satellites cluster, 5) Many satellites visible in long-exposure ISS photos as streaks, 6) ISS astronauts DO occasionally photograph satellites (Hubble servicing missions, visiting spacecraft, passing satellites documented). Visualization exaggerates visual density - satellites aren't clustered that tightly from any single vantage point. Similar to how stars exist but we don't see thousands simultaneously from ground level during day5:T926,Spiral vortex graphic criticizing blind trust in scientific authority. Digital illustration with text criticizing appeal to authority in science. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'BELIEVING A SCIENTIST JUST BECAUSE HE'S A SCIENTIST ISN'T SCIENCE.' Background shows abstract 3D rendered spiral vortex pattern in electric blue/cyan and dark navy colors creating hypnotic tunnel effect. Central spiral appears to recede infinitely inward with concentric circular grid lines creating depth illusion. Pattern suggests portal, wormhole, or mandala design with radiating geometric precision. Dark blue/black dominates outer regions transitioning to brighter cyan-blue toward center. Grid lines form diamond/square mesh overlay on spiral surface adding mathematical/technical aesthetic. Two small dark silhouette objects (possibly asteroids or spacecraft) visible in spiral suggesting cosmic/space theme. Lower right corner shows bright blue light burst/lens flare effect. Bottom text in matching large bold white letters: 'IT'S A BELIEF'. Lower left shows 'Flat Earth Matters' attribution in light blue text. Meme argues accepting scientific claims based purely on scientist's credentials represents faith-based belief rather than scientific thinking. Encourages skepticism and personal investigation rather than deference to expertise. Valid point about scientific method requiring evidence and reproducibility, not blind authority worship. However, statement can enable anti-intellectualism and false equivalence between expert knowledge and uninformed opinion. While scientists can be wrong and should be questioned, scientific consensus emerges from rigorous peer review, reproducible experiments, mathematical proofs, and decades of evidence evaluation. Lay person doing 'own research' on YouTube lacks laboratory equipment, mathematical training, experimental methodology, and peer review process that validates scientific findings. Healthy skepticism differs from rejecting all expert knowledge. Spherical Earth isn't believed because scientists say so - it's accepted because observations anyone can make (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, circumnavigation, time zones, Foucault pendulum) plus satellite communications, GPS, weather forecasting all require spherical trigonometry to function0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-302","title":"Other 302","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745535_466625366870536_8988562656268671281_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-301","title":"Other 301","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745516_464362237096849_1873592563778867138_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-303","title":"Other 303","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12745549_467262846806788_754174638151096184_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
