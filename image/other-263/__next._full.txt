13:T78d,Science versus pseudoscience comparison chart from Flat Earth Matters. Educational infographic contrasting scientific method with pseudoscientific approaches on black background. Title at top in large white and cyan text: 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Two columns separated by vertical line - left column labeled 'SCIENCE' in white, right column labeled 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' in italicized cyan. Nine bullet points in each column using triangular bullet markers. SCIENCE column (white text): 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. PSEUDOSCIENCE column (cyan text): 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm.', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence.', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence.', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic.', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'Flat Earth Matters' in large white text. Ironic that Flat Earth community shares this chart claiming mainstream science exhibits pseudoscience characteristics while their approach follows true science. However, flat Earth methodology demonstrates classic pseudoscience: starts with conclusion (Earth is flat), hostile to criticism, cherry-picks evidence (ignoring ships disappearing over horizon, satellite communications, circumnavigation), uses flawed experiments, works in isolation from scientific community, dogmatic refusal to accept contradictory evidence. Chart accurately describes scientific method versus conspiracy theory thinking14:T6a5,Sea level versus sea curve meme arguing oceans appear flat. Two-panel comparison photograph claiming water surfaces show no curvature. Top panel shows ocean scene with text 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in large black sans-serif font. Image displays expansive ocean view with dark blue water in foreground showing gentle wave texture and ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level across middle of frame. Small two-masted sailboat visible as dark silhouette on horizon slightly left of center - boat appears upright with both masts visible. Sky above shows light blue color near horizon transitioning to brighter turquoise-cyan at top with wispy white clouds. Water surface appears flat and level extending to horizon. Bottom panel shows identical or very similar photograph with text 'NOT SEA CURVE' in same black font. Image nearly identical to top - same dark blue rippled ocean water, same straight horizon line, same small sailboat in same position, same light blue sky with clouds. Panels demonstrate that from observer's perspective on beach or ship, horizon appears straight and flat, not curved. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with 8 inches per mile squared curvature, curve should be visible across ocean. However, on sphere with 12,742 km diameter, curvature is imperceptible at human scale. To see 8 inches of drop, must observe over 1 mile distance. To see noticeable curve, need hundreds of miles of view from significant altitude. At sea level looking at horizon 3-5 miles away, curvature is too subtle for human eye. Horizon always appears level because it represents circle of equal distance around observer - even on sphere, local horizon appears as straight line15:T65f,Denzel Washington Training Day meme celebrating flat Earth belief. Popular internet meme format using still frame from 2001 film Training Day starring Denzel Washington. Image shows close-up of Washington's character Detective Alonzo Harris smiling broadly with satisfied, knowing expression. He wears dark clothing and holds cigarette or toothpick in teeth. Background shows blurred light blue-white tones suggesting indoor setting or car interior. Washington's face displays wide genuine smile showing teeth with slight gap, eyes crinkled with joy, overall expression of deep satisfaction and contentment. Top text in bold white capital letters with black outline: 'DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A'. Bottom text in matching style: 'FLAT EARTHER'. Meme format originally captioned 'DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTER' referencing both Training Day's criminal underworld setting and Geto Boys' song 'Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta'. Format used to express satisfaction about belonging to particular group or believing particular thing. In this context, meme celebrates feeling of being flat Earth believer - suggests pride, confidence, satisfaction in rejecting mainstream globe Earth model. Implies flat Earthers feel superior knowledge or enlightenment, part of special group that 'knows the truth'. Common sentiment in conspiracy theory communities where members feel they possess hidden knowledge others lack. Denzel's confident, satisfied expression perfectly captures this feeling of self-assurance. Meme suggests flat Earth belief brings sense of empowerment and community belonging despite (or because of) its fringe status9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-263","title":"Other 263","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12715437_462310933968646_1713054839718788751_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-262","title":"Other 262","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12715417_465950130271393_8854944052571313820_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-264","title":"Other 264","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12716033_464688487064224_5372428259831862156_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
