5:T78d,Science versus pseudoscience comparison chart from Flat Earth Matters. Educational infographic contrasting scientific method with pseudoscientific approaches on black background. Title at top in large white and cyan text: 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Two columns separated by vertical line - left column labeled 'SCIENCE' in white, right column labeled 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' in italicized cyan. Nine bullet points in each column using triangular bullet markers. SCIENCE column (white text): 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. PSEUDOSCIENCE column (cyan text): 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm.', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence.', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence.', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic.', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'Flat Earth Matters' in large white text. Ironic that Flat Earth community shares this chart claiming mainstream science exhibits pseudoscience characteristics while their approach follows true science. However, flat Earth methodology demonstrates classic pseudoscience: starts with conclusion (Earth is flat), hostile to criticism, cherry-picks evidence (ignoring ships disappearing over horizon, satellite communications, circumnavigation), uses flawed experiments, works in isolation from scientific community, dogmatic refusal to accept contradictory evidence. Chart accurately describes scientific method versus conspiracy theory thinking0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 263 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Science versus pseudoscience comparison chart from Flat Earth Matters.
