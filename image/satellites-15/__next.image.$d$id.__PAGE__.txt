Shows gold/bronze colored satellite with extended solar panel arrays orbiting above Earth's blue atmosphere with white clouds visible. Large yellow text at top: 'REMEMBER THAT TIME THEY SOLVED A CRIME USING SATELLITES?' followed by bottom yellow text: 'ME EITHER.' Dark blue gradient sky transitioning to Earth curve at bottom. Satirical commentary suggesting satellites are never actually used to solve crimes despite claims of sophisticated surveillance capabilities, questioning whether functional orbital satellites exist at all or if crime-solving satellite surveillance is fictional/exaggerated in media. Implies satellite technology may not have practical real-world crime prevention/investigation applications despite popular perception from movies and TV shows."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-14","title":"Satellites 14","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/46289316_307812833394503_8725136047899410432_n.jpeg","description":"Meme questioning ISS photography logistics. Shows International Space Station with extended solar panel arrays against backdrop of Earth with blue oceans and white cloud swirls. Top text in white with black outline: '17,000 MPH PERFECT PHOTO'. Bottom text: 'WHO AND WHAT CAMERA WITH CRAZY ASS SHUTTER SPEED TOOK THAT PHOTO?' Questions technical feasibility of capturing sharp, detailed photographs of ISS traveling at orbital velocity (17,000+ mph) from external perspective. Challenges who/what could photograph ISS from outside while matching its speed, what camera equipment would have sufficient shutter speed to freeze motion at that velocity, and why official ISS photos appear perfectly composed and focused rather than motion-blurred. Suggests ISS photographs may be CGI, composites, or taken in different circumstances than claimed."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-16","title":"Satellites 16","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/68685903_10218398921661600_1919508570634715136_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'TRUE STORY' comparing NASA technology from 1964 vs 1969. Left panel shows 'NASAs first communication satellite launches in 1964' with black and white photograph of large spherical metallic balloon satellite labeled 'N.A.S.A.' on ground with launch infrastructure and workers visible in background. Right panel titled 'NASA 5 summers later in 1969' with thinking face emoji and double exclamation marks shows two iconic Apollo images: top shows Earth photographed from space (blue marble), bottom shows astronauts on lunar surface with American flag and lunar module. Satirical timeline suggesting NASA advanced impossibly fast from basic balloon satellite technology in 1964 to manned moon landing with complex spacecraft just 5 years later, questioning credibility of claimed rapid technological progress. Implies Moon landing may have been fabricated given limited satellite capabilities shortly before."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
