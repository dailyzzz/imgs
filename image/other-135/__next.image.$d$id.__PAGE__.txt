3:T490,Flat Earth cosmology diagram illustrating sea water currents and sun's circular path. Title at top: 'Sea water currents & The path of the sun above the flat earth'. Shows azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center. Continents shown in yellow-green (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. White arrows indicate circular current patterns: 'SOUTH PACIFIC GYRE' on left, 'NORTH PACIFIC GYRE' visible, 'SOUTH ATLANTIC' labeled, 'INDIAN OCEAN GYRE' on right. Sun's path shown as concentric circles: outer yellow circle labeled 'Tropic of Cancer' at top, inner red circle labeled 'NORTH/SOUTH' showing sun's movement, yellow 'Equator' line crosses center, bottom circle labeled 'Tropic of Capricorn'. Small white moon illustration upper right. Bottom text explains: 'The electromagnetic energy from the sun causes the different directions in the currents of Northern Hemi'plane vs Southern Hemi'plane'. Attribution: '©Ashlee Webster'. Website: 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Diagram argues ocean gyres and currents make more sense on flat plane with circling sun than on rotating sphere4:T422,Museum or gallery photograph showing three people as silhouettes viewing large framed azimuthal equidistant flat Earth map on white wall. Polished beige tile floor reflects figures and lighting. Left figure (man in dark jacket) and right figure (person in dark clothing) stand at distance. Center figure (woman with long dark hair wearing red/burgundy jacket and dark pants) stands directly in front of map. Large white-framed map dominates wall showing flat Earth projection with North Pole at center. Map titled 'EVO ANTAKAN STORIE OF YN DID' (partially visible) with two smaller globe diagrams in upper corners. Main circular map shows continents in colors - blue oceans, yellow/green landmasses (Africa prominent on right, Americas center-left, Asia/Australia). Grid lines radiate from center. Map appears to be historical cartographic artifact. Attribution '©Ashlee Webster' at bottom center. Image captures people contemplating alternative Earth model in formal exhibition setting, suggesting flat Earth cosmology gaining mainstream cultural attention0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-135","title":"Other 135","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12342667_441088416090898_7257479148511891092_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-134","title":"Other 134","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12341245_440357502830656_5309146363670896704_n.png","description":"Historical title page from 1865 flat Earth book. White page with black serif typography. Header reads '[Entered at Stationers' Hall.]' Main title in large capital letters: 'ZETETIC ASTRONOMY. EARTH NOT A GLOBE! AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE TRUE FIGURE OF THE EARTH: PROVING IT A PLANE, WITHOUT AXIAL OR ORBITAL MOTION; AND THE ONLY MATERIAL WORLD IN THE UNIVERSE!' Author listed as 'BY \"PARALLAX.\"' Published in London by 'SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, AND CO., STATIONERS' HALL COURT.' and 'Bath: S. HAYWARD, GREEN STREET.' Date: 1865. Bottom note: '[The Right of Translation is Reserved by the Author.]' with handwritten notation '1746.23'. Zetetic method emphasizes sensory observation over theoretical astronomy. 'Parallax' was pseudonym of Samuel Rowbotham, influential 19th century flat Earth proponent. Book laid foundation for modern flat Earth movement, arguing Earth is stationary plane based on direct observation and experiments rather than heliocentric model"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-136","title":"Other 136","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12347581_440712966128443_1534322738022711994_n.jpg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
