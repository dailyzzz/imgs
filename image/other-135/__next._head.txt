5:T490,Flat Earth cosmology diagram illustrating sea water currents and sun's circular path. Title at top: 'Sea water currents & The path of the sun above the flat earth'. Shows azimuthal equidistant projection map with North Pole at center. Continents shown in yellow-green (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia). Blue oceans surround landmasses. White arrows indicate circular current patterns: 'SOUTH PACIFIC GYRE' on left, 'NORTH PACIFIC GYRE' visible, 'SOUTH ATLANTIC' labeled, 'INDIAN OCEAN GYRE' on right. Sun's path shown as concentric circles: outer yellow circle labeled 'Tropic of Cancer' at top, inner red circle labeled 'NORTH/SOUTH' showing sun's movement, yellow 'Equator' line crosses center, bottom circle labeled 'Tropic of Capricorn'. Small white moon illustration upper right. Bottom text explains: 'The electromagnetic energy from the sun causes the different directions in the currents of Northern Hemi'plane vs Southern Hemi'plane'. Attribution: '©Ashlee Webster'. Website: 'www.FlatGeocentricEarth.wordpress.com'. Diagram argues ocean gyres and currents make more sense on flat plane with circling sun than on rotating sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 135 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Flat Earth cosmology diagram illustrating sea water currents and sun's circular path.
