Document lists simplifying assumptions for flight dynamics including: 'There is a flat Earth. (The Earth's curvature is zero.)', 'There is a non-rotating Earth. (No Coriolis accelerations and such are present.)', 'The aircraft has constant mass', plus additional assumptions about rigid body, symmetry, rotating masses, and constant wind.
