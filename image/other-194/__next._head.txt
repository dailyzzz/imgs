5:T477,Office Space Bill Lumbergh meme about airplane curvature claims. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) from 1999 comedy Office Space. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, burgundy/red suspenders, yellow tie with leopard/animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug. Has characteristic condescending smirk/smile expression. Blurred beige office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, doors visible. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'UMMM...YEAH, IF YOU COULD STOP SAYING YOU'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE FROM AN AIRPLANE'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate-speak ('that would be great') to mock common globe Earth claim. Many people report seeing Earth's curvature from commercial flights at 35,000-40,000 feet. Flat Earth proponents argue curvature isn't visible at these altitudes and what people see is either fisheye lens distortion from airplane windows or psychological expectation. Claims actual visibility of curvature requires much higher altitude (60,000+ feet)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 194 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Office Space Bill Lumbergh meme about airplane curvature claims.
