3:T477,Office Space Bill Lumbergh meme about airplane curvature claims. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) from 1999 comedy Office Space. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, burgundy/red suspenders, yellow tie with leopard/animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug. Has characteristic condescending smirk/smile expression. Blurred beige office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, doors visible. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'UMMM...YEAH, IF YOU COULD STOP SAYING YOU'VE SEEN THE CURVATURE FROM AN AIRPLANE'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate-speak ('that would be great') to mock common globe Earth claim. Many people report seeing Earth's curvature from commercial flights at 35,000-40,000 feet. Flat Earth proponents argue curvature isn't visible at these altitudes and what people see is either fisheye lens distortion from airplane windows or psychological expectation. Claims actual visibility of curvature requires much higher altitude (60,000+ feet)4:T4a3,Brian Cox tweet defending moon landing overlaid on Apollo photograph. Background shows famous moon landing photograph - astronaut in white spacesuit planting American flag on lunar surface, gray rocky moon terrain, black space sky. Foreground shows Twitter interface screenshot of verified tweet from Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox), British physicist and TV presenter. Profile picture shows Cox's face. Blue verified checkmark next to name. Gear icon and 'Follow' button visible. Tweet text reads: 'I've said it before and I'll say it again - if you don't think Apollo 11 landed on Moon you are a colossal nob end & should get a new brain'. Bottom shows engagement metrics: '18,106 RETWEETS' and '5,483 FAVORITES' (old Twitter interface). Row of small profile pictures showing people who engaged with tweet. Cox's aggressive dismissive tone ('colossal nob end' - British insult) represents mainstream scientific community's contempt for moon landing skeptics. Tweet suggests questioning official narrative warrants ridicule rather than rational debate. Flat Earth/moon landing skeptics use this as example of argument from authority and ad hominem attacks instead of evidence-based discussion5:T4d7,European Space Agency Rosetta mission infographic with timeline and key moments. Black space background with pink/magenta design elements. Top left section titled 'LAUNCH March 2004' shows small blue Earth. Curved pink trajectory line with numbered milestones circles around diagram. Timeline includes: '1. March 2005 First Earth flyby', '2. November 2007 Mars gravity slingshot', '3. February 2007 Extra speed added from Mars slingshot', '4. June 2012 Enters hibernation to conserve energy'. Center shows 'ROSETTA ORBITER' spacecraft illustration with gold/bronze body and large blue solar panels. Right side titled 'THE MISSION' explains comet mission details. Pink circle labeled 'THE COMET 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko' describes comet as traveling through solar system with rocky particles and ice. Bottom right shows gray irregular potato-shaped comet with 'Philae Primary landing site 19-11-14' marked. 'PHILAE LANDER' module illustrated landing on surface. Left side panel 'KEY MOMENTS' lists mission highlights in white text on magenta background. Bottom sources: 'Graphic News, European Space Agency'. Historic space mission demonstrating orbital mechanics, gravity assists, deep space navigation, and first successful comet landing0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-194","title":"Other 194","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552819_457260614473678_7507966457741343678_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-193","title":"Other 193","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552561_457569974442742_6404651084500412606_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-195","title":"Other 195","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12552861_455841464615593_7783021761301399950_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
