3:T5ea,Aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting ocean water. Shows striking natural boundary between ice and sea in polar region. Left side of image displays dark navy-blue ocean water with slightly rippled surface showing wave texture and occasional white specks suggesting floating ice fragments, sea foam, or atmospheric particles. Water appears deep and cold. Center features dramatic irregular ice edge - thick white and light blue glacial ice forming natural cliff or wall where ice shelf meets ocean. Edge shows jagged, uneven formation with vertical face where ice has broken or calved. Ice surface appears textured with rough, crystalline structure. Transition zone between ice and water shows light blue-white coloring where ice meets sea. Right side shows ice shelf surface extending into distance - bright white snow and ice covering with pale gray-blue sky above. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations. Sky shows overcast or hazy conditions typical of polar environments. Photograph likely taken from aircraft or drone looking down at approximately 30-45 degree angle. Image captures stark beauty of Antarctic landscape and ongoing process of ice shelf dynamics where glacial ice continuously breaks off into ocean. No text visible. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter, though this shows typical ice shelf calving process occurring throughout Antarctic coastline. Image demonstrates natural glacial processes at edge of continent4:T8a4,Water sticking to ball Earth meme using tilted tray demonstration. Flat Earth argument questioning how water adheres to spinning spherical Earth using practical demonstration. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER CURVES AND STICKS TO BALL EARTH?'. Central image shows experimental setup with clear plastic laboratory tray or sample holder containing multiple compartments filled with colored liquids. Tray appears to be standard scientific sample holder with approximately 8-10 rectangular wells/compartments. Each compartment contains liquid in different color: yellow, light green, mint green, light blue, purple, dark purple gradient left to right. Tray mounted at steep downward angle (approximately 30-40 degrees) on brown wooden support stand or holder. Despite significant tilt, colored liquids remain level within their compartments, demonstrating water's tendency to find level surface. Liquid surfaces appear horizontal, perpendicular to gravity, not parallel to tilted tray bottom. Background shows white or light gray wall with visible texture/wear. Stand supported by metal or dark supports on sides. Wooden horizontal bar connects supports. Social media attribution in lower left: '@nasa_is_lying_to_us' in black text. Bottom text in massive bold white letters with black outline: 'SCIENTIFIC MYTH'. Light gray/off-white textured background. Argument structure: If Earth is spinning ball, water should fly off due to centrifugal force, or if gravity strong enough to hold oceans, water should curve around ball. This demonstration attempts to show water always seeks level, cannot stick to or curve around exterior of sphere. However, argument ignores scale differences. Earth is 12,742 km diameter - from human perspective on surface, curvature is imperceptible. Gravity acts toward center (down), not 'sideways' as implied. Small tray tilted has visible angle; on massive sphere, local 'down' is always perpendicular to surface at that location. Water does curve around Earth - ships disappear bottom-first over horizon, cannot see across large bodies of water. Demonstration conflates local level (perpendicular to gravity) with global level (curved surface of sphere)5:T6a5,Sea level versus sea curve meme arguing oceans appear flat. Two-panel comparison photograph claiming water surfaces show no curvature. Top panel shows ocean scene with text 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in large black sans-serif font. Image displays expansive ocean view with dark blue water in foreground showing gentle wave texture and ripples. Horizon line appears perfectly straight and level across middle of frame. Small two-masted sailboat visible as dark silhouette on horizon slightly left of center - boat appears upright with both masts visible. Sky above shows light blue color near horizon transitioning to brighter turquoise-cyan at top with wispy white clouds. Water surface appears flat and level extending to horizon. Bottom panel shows identical or very similar photograph with text 'NOT SEA CURVE' in same black font. Image nearly identical to top - same dark blue rippled ocean water, same straight horizon line, same small sailboat in same position, same light blue sky with clouds. Panels demonstrate that from observer's perspective on beach or ship, horizon appears straight and flat, not curved. Flat Earth argument claims if Earth were sphere with 8 inches per mile squared curvature, curve should be visible across ocean. However, on sphere with 12,742 km diameter, curvature is imperceptible at human scale. To see 8 inches of drop, must observe over 1 mile distance. To see noticeable curve, need hundreds of miles of view from significant altitude. At sea level looking at horizon 3-5 miles away, curvature is too subtle for human eye. Horizon always appears level because it represents circle of equal distance around observer - even on sphere, local horizon appears as straight line0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-261","title":"Other 261","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12710947_461770347356038_3681852479021078351_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-260","title":"Other 260","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12705795_464572817075791_8269778798616448831_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-262","title":"Other 262","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12715417_465950130271393_8854944052571313820_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
