5:T5ea,Aerial photograph of Antarctic ice shelf edge meeting ocean water. Shows striking natural boundary between ice and sea in polar region. Left side of image displays dark navy-blue ocean water with slightly rippled surface showing wave texture and occasional white specks suggesting floating ice fragments, sea foam, or atmospheric particles. Water appears deep and cold. Center features dramatic irregular ice edge - thick white and light blue glacial ice forming natural cliff or wall where ice shelf meets ocean. Edge shows jagged, uneven formation with vertical face where ice has broken or calved. Ice surface appears textured with rough, crystalline structure. Transition zone between ice and water shows light blue-white coloring where ice meets sea. Right side shows ice shelf surface extending into distance - bright white snow and ice covering with pale gray-blue sky above. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations. Sky shows overcast or hazy conditions typical of polar environments. Photograph likely taken from aircraft or drone looking down at approximately 30-45 degree angle. Image captures stark beauty of Antarctic landscape and ongoing process of ice shelf dynamics where glacial ice continuously breaks off into ocean. No text visible. Flat Earth community shares Antarctic imagery as evidence of ice wall perimeter, though this shows typical ice shelf calving process occurring throughout Antarctic coastline.
