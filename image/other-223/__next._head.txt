5:T59a,Three bridge photographs demonstrating horizon as convergence line. Black background with white text header at top: 'The "horizon" is a line of convergence.' Three photographs arranged horizontally showing long bridges or causeways from driver's perspective. Left image shows aerial view of cable-stayed bridge with single tall white pylon/tower, white roadway stretching into distance over blue water, surrounded by green land. Sky gradient light to medium blue. Center image shows ground-level view driving on bridge roadway - white concrete lanes with yellow center line, gray barriers on sides, overcast sky, water visible both sides. Getty Images watermark visible. Right image shows similar ground-level bridge view - tan/beige roadway with white center line, water on both sides, light blue sky with white clouds, bridge appears to extend straight to horizon. White text at bottom: 'Not the curvature of a ball.' All three images show straight horizontal lines where water meets sky at eye level. Flat Earth argument claims what mainstream science calls 'horizon' caused by Earth's curvature is actually vanishing point where parallel lines appear to converge due to perspective, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at distance. Claims bridges appear to rise to meet horizon due to perspective compression, not because they follow Earth's curve. Argues true curve would show bridge descending away from observer0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 223 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Three bridge photographs demonstrating horizon as convergence line.
