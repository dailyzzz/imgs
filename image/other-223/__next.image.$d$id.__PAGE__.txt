3:T59a,Three bridge photographs demonstrating horizon as convergence line. Black background with white text header at top: 'The "horizon" is a line of convergence.' Three photographs arranged horizontally showing long bridges or causeways from driver's perspective. Left image shows aerial view of cable-stayed bridge with single tall white pylon/tower, white roadway stretching into distance over blue water, surrounded by green land. Sky gradient light to medium blue. Center image shows ground-level view driving on bridge roadway - white concrete lanes with yellow center line, gray barriers on sides, overcast sky, water visible both sides. Getty Images watermark visible. Right image shows similar ground-level bridge view - tan/beige roadway with white center line, water on both sides, light blue sky with white clouds, bridge appears to extend straight to horizon. White text at bottom: 'Not the curvature of a ball.' All three images show straight horizontal lines where water meets sky at eye level. Flat Earth argument claims what mainstream science calls 'horizon' caused by Earth's curvature is actually vanishing point where parallel lines appear to converge due to perspective, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at distance. Claims bridges appear to rise to meet horizon due to perspective compression, not because they follow Earth's curve. Argues true curve would show bridge descending away from observer4:T580,Earth size comparison from different distances questioning NASA consistency. Shows two space photographs on black background comparing Earth's apparent size. Top section labeled 'Earth from 240,000 miles away' shows famous 'Earthrise' photograph from Apollo 8 mission (1968) - partial Earth rising above gray lunar surface/horizon. Earth appears as blue-white crescent showing cloud patterns, oceans, partial view of planet against pure black space. Bottom section labeled 'Earth from 1,000,000 miles away' shows full disk Earth photograph - complete spherical Earth with blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents. However, image shows unusual circular hole or missing data in center revealing gray/tan surface below, making Earth appear like donut or ring. Bottom text asks: 'Any questions??' Image questions why Earth appears larger when photographed from greater distance (1 million miles) compared to closer distance (240,000 miles), violating basic perspective principles. Flat Earth skeptics use this to argue NASA photographs are inconsistent, doctored, or fabricated. The hole in center of distant Earth image particularly suspicious - could indicate image manipulation, missing data, or processing artifact. However, comparison may use different camera lenses, focal lengths, or cropping that affect apparent size. Different missions used different photographic equipment affecting field of view5:T58a,Aerial photograph above clouds showing flat horizon with Mount Fuji. Shows stunning high-altitude aerial view from airplane window. Sky gradient from deep navy blue at top transitioning to lighter blue in middle section. Thick layer of white-gray clouds fills lower two-thirds creating cotton-like textured blanket extending to horizon. Clouds show variations in density, some areas thicker white, others wispy translucent. Most prominent feature: snow-capped Mount Fuji (iconic Japanese volcano) rising through cloud layer in lower center-right. Mountain shows distinctive symmetrical cone shape with white snow covering peak, darker volcanic rock visible on slopes, shadow cast on clouds below. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across image where clouds meet sky. Perspective from high altitude (likely 30,000-40,000 feet commercial flight). Top displays large white text: 'FLATNESS'. Bottom right corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white. Image used as evidence that horizon always appears flat at eye level regardless of altitude. Flat Earth proponents argue if Earth were sphere, horizon should show visible curve from this altitude. Claims flat horizon proves flat plane rather than curved surface. Mainstream science explains horizon appears flat due to Earth's large size (8,000 mile diameter) - curvature is too gradual to perceive from these altitudes without fisheye lens0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-223","title":"Other 223","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654673_463012263898513_1204418471088636272_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-222","title":"Other 222","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654660_461478704051869_130185143645037755_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-224","title":"Other 224","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12654693_460135770852829_6611736404814185123_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
