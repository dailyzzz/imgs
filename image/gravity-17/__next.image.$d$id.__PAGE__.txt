Quote in black text reads: 'Einstein's relativity work is a magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king.. its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists.' Attribution: '— Nikola Tesla —' with 'AZ QUOTES' logo below. Tesla criticizes Einstein's relativity theory (including gravity as spacetime curvature) as mathematically impressive but fundamentally flawed, dressed up to appear legitimate. Suggests relativity physicists are philosophers rather than empirical scientists. Quote commonly used by alternative physics proponents to validate rejecting mainstream gravity theory"},"prevImage":{"id":"gravity-16","title":"Gravity 16","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/38707783_1770712812965814_7064169488983261184_n.jpeg","description":"Satirical Biblical creation parody meme with purple cosmic nebula background. Top text: 'IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS NOTHING AND NOTHING SAID, \"LET THERE BE BIG BANG!\" AND THERE WAS MASS'. Center shows artistic rendering of God (Michelangelo-style white-bearded figure in flowing robes) reaching toward Big Bang explosion on right, with ape/chimpanzee face in space helmet on left, all surrounded by stars and galaxies. Bottom text: 'THEN MASS FORMED AN APE IN THE IMAGE OF STAR DUST AND PLACED HIM ON A SPINNING PEAR ROCK FLOATING IN A MASSIVE SPACE VACUUM AND IT WAS GOOD. ~ BOOK OF GRAVITY 33:13'. Mockingly parallels Genesis creation narrative with secular cosmology and evolution, presenting Big Bang, formation of mass, evolution from apes, and spinning oblate spheroid Earth as absurd religious doctrine called 'Book of Gravity'.
