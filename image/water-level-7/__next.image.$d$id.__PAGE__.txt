3:T470,Six-panel collage demonstrating water's flat surface at all scales. Left column shows three examples: top - tall glass of water with label 'FLAT' pointing to level surface; middle - round fishbowl with goldfish and label 'FLAT' pointing to water surface; bottom - metal bucket/pail with water labeled 'FLAT'. Right column shows three larger-scale examples: top - blue swimming pool with lane dividers and 'FLAT' label; middle - mountain lake with perfect reflections of snow-capped peaks, evergreen trees on shore, labeled 'FLAT'; bottom - ocean horizon view with puffy white clouds and deep blue water, labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows aerial city skyline photo with text 'ON LAND WE USE LEVELERS WHICH ALSO CONTAINS WATER' followed by large text 'EARTH IS 71% WATER AND 29% LAND' and 'SO WHERE EXACTLY IS "THE CURVATURE"?' Watermark 'FLAT EARTH FOR DUMMIES'. Argues water always maintains level surface in all containers and bodies regardless of size, questioning where Earth's curvature exists if 71% is flat water. Uses construction levelers containing water bubbles as additional evidence that water defines level/flat surfaces4:T455,Four-panel educational meme titled 'ALL THESE THINGS' at top and 'CANNOT WORK ON THE GLOBE' at bottom. Top left shows submarine periscope emerging from calm ocean water with label 'PERISCOPE'. Top right shows lighthouse on rocky coast during stormy weather with label 'LIGHTHOUSE'. Bottom left shows mechanical gyroscope device with labeled parts: 'Gyroscope frame', 'Spin axis', 'Gimbal', and 'Rotor' with label 'GYROSCOPE'. Bottom right shows sundial on grass with shadow cast by sun with label 'SUNDIAL'. Argues these four technologies only function properly on flat Earth: periscopes work because water is level allowing straight-line viewing; lighthouses are visible beyond supposed curvature distance; gyroscopes maintain orientation without accounting for Earth's rotation; sundials work using sun's movement rather than Earth's rotation. Claims these practical instruments prove flat, stationary Earth and would fail or require compensation if Earth were rotating sphere. Questions why navigation and timekeeping tools designed for flat plane work perfectly without adjusting for curvature or rotation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-7","title":"Water Level 7","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962718_1473512442677618_6178428728764111783_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-6","title":"Water Level 6","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962568_1473512486010947_2425436458586665699_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme about water curvature and scale. Top panel shows close-up photograph of small puddle in dirt/gravel with bird (appears to be crow or raven) standing in shallow water. Text reads 'A puddle of water doesn't begin to curve simply because it gets bigger.' Bottom panel shows aerial/satellite view of large body of water (lake or bay) with irregular blue-turquoise colored water surrounded by green land masses, urban development visible on shores. White lines drawn across water surface suggesting measurement or emphasis on flat appearance. Argues that water remains flat regardless of scale - small puddle or massive lake both display level surfaces without curvature. Questions why oceans should curve to fit spherical Earth if smaller bodies of water demonstrably don't curve. Presents scaling argument against water conforming to Earth's curvature: if puddles are flat, why should larger water bodies be any different"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-8","title":"Water Level 8","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/16266229_10212397836681450_3016190395013929116_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
