5:T470,Six-panel collage demonstrating water's flat surface at all scales. Left column shows three examples: top - tall glass of water with label 'FLAT' pointing to level surface; middle - round fishbowl with goldfish and label 'FLAT' pointing to water surface; bottom - metal bucket/pail with water labeled 'FLAT'. Right column shows three larger-scale examples: top - blue swimming pool with lane dividers and 'FLAT' label; middle - mountain lake with perfect reflections of snow-capped peaks, evergreen trees on shore, labeled 'FLAT'; bottom - ocean horizon view with puffy white clouds and deep blue water, labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows aerial city skyline photo with text 'ON LAND WE USE LEVELERS WHICH ALSO CONTAINS WATER' followed by large text 'EARTH IS 71% WATER AND 29% LAND' and 'SO WHERE EXACTLY IS "THE CURVATURE"?' Watermark 'FLAT EARTH FOR DUMMIES'. Argues water always maintains level surface in all containers and bodies regardless of size, questioning where Earth's curvature exists if 71% is flat water. Uses construction levelers containing water bubbles as additional evidence that water defines level/flat surfaces0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 7 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Six-panel collage demonstrating water's flat surface at all scales.
