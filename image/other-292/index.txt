13:T8b1,Water level collage demonstrating flat horizon argument across multiple scenarios. Six-panel photographic collage showing water surfaces appearing level/flat. Top left: Tropical beach with turquoise Caribbean-blue shallow water, white sandy bottom visible through clear water, horizon line appears perfectly straight across distance where water meets sky. Light blue sky with slight clouds. Top center: Straight country road stretching into distance with green fields on sides, gray asphalt, blue sky with white clouds, power lines visible. Rural landscape. Top right: Canal or waterway with dark still water reflecting sky, straight towpath along right side, brick building visible on right, trees and vegetation, overcast sky. Surface appears perfectly flat and mirror-like. Center: Diagram showing water level demonstration with connected vessels - scientific illustration with four glass tubes/cylinders of different heights connected at bottom by clear tube creating U-shape or connected vessel system. Blue water fills tubes to same level across all containers (labeled with measurements: 1 ft, 2 ft, 3 ft, 4 ft markers) demonstrating principle that water finds same level in connected containers regardless of vessel height. Water colored blue for visibility. Bottom left: Aerial/satellite view of coastline showing tan/beige land meeting bright turquoise shallow water, deeper blue-black ocean beyond, white sandy beach or sediment visible. Shows large scale where water surface appears flat. Bottom right: Aerial view of meandering river or waterway creating S-curves through dark landscape, water appears silver-gray reflecting sky, shows natural water flow patterns. Red horizontal line drawn across top of image spanning entire width suggesting level measurement or horizon reference. Collage argues water always finds level, never curves - therefore large bodies of water prove flat Earth. Classic flat Earth claim. However, 'level' means perpendicular to gravity direction, which points toward Earth's center. On sphere, 'level' at each location is tangent to spherical surface - creates curved surface globally while appearing flat locally. Water DOES curve with Earth - ships disappear hull-first over horizon14:T7ac,Flat Earth map showing analemma sun path and flight routes diagram. Azimuthal equidistant projection map with flight paths and solar patterns labeled as analemma. Title at top on beige border: 'FLAT EARTH COSMOLOGY & KNOWLEDGE'. Central circular map on black background shows continents in bright green. North Pole at center with landmasses radiating outward: North America on right side, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia across top and upper left, Australia lower left. Black ocean areas surround green continents. Outer edge shows thick light blue/white ring representing ice wall or Antarctic barrier. Multiple concentric circular lines in different colors overlay map representing climate zones, tropics, or sun paths: Outermost white/light blue ring (Antarctic Circle), red circle (Tropic of Capricorn area), yellow/orange circle (Tropic of Cancer area), smaller circles toward center. Several curved dotted lines trace across map appearing to show flight paths or sun's analemma pattern - lines curve in arcs connecting different locations. White dashed line curves from near Africa across Pacific toward South America. Red dashed line arcs from Asia area. Yellow/orange curved line near center. Labels partially visible reading 'IS CANCERI...' (likely Tropic of Cancer), 'ANTARCTIC...' (Antarctic Circle), other geographic markers. Bottom text on beige border: 'ANALEMMA'. Analemma typically refers to figure-8 pattern sun traces in sky over year when photographed from same location at same time daily - results from Earth's axial tilt and elliptical orbit. This diagram attempts to show analemma on flat Earth map, but unclear how flat Earth model would produce this pattern. Lines might also represent claimed airline flight paths that allegedly make more sense on flat map than globe (though this is projection distortion illusion - routes are actually great circles on sphere). Map uses vintage aesthetic with beige border15:T894,The Seven Luminaries flat Earth cosmology diagram. Artistic illustration showing flat Earth model with seven celestial bodies labeled as 'luminaries'. Black background with dark gray double-border frame. Upper portion shows circular flat Earth disc viewed from above - blue oceans surrounding green continents arranged around central white Arctic/North Pole. North America visible on right, South America lower right, Africa center-left, Europe and Asia top and left, Australia lower left. Outer ring shows thick white/gray ice barrier representing Antarctica. Central area displays photorealistic continents with natural coloring. Below Earth disc arranged in two rows: planetary bodies shown as spheres with labels. Top row left to right: Mars (small reddish-orange sphere labeled 'MARS'), Venus (pale cream sphere labeled 'VENUS'), Jupiter (large tan sphere with bands labeled 'JUPITER'), Mercury (small gray-tan sphere labeled 'MERCURY'), Saturn (pale yellow sphere with distinctive ring system labeled 'SATURN'). Bottom row: Sun (bright orange-yellow glowing sphere labeled 'SUN'), white triangular mountain peak (labeled 'HOLY MOUNTAIN'), Moon (gray cratered sphere labeled 'MOON'). Holy Mountain positioned centrally between sun and moon. All celestial objects rendered with realistic textures - Mars shows red surface, Jupiter shows swirling bands, Saturn's rings detailed, Moon shows craters, Sun has glowing corona effect. Bottom text in italics: 'THE 7 LUMINARIES'. Diagram represents esoteric flat Earth cosmology combining seven classical 'wandering stars' (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) with biblical/ancient cosmology. In ancient astronomy, these seven celestial bodies were 'luminaries' or 'wanderers' distinguishable from fixed stars. Inclusion of 'Holy Mountain' references various mythological cosmologies placing sacred mountain at world's center (Mount Meru in Hindu/Buddhist, Mount Olympus in Greek, Zion in Abrahamic traditions). However, modern astronomy understands Sun as star, Moon as natural satellite, five planets as worlds orbiting Sun. Saturn's rings, Jupiter's atmospheric bands, Mars' surface features all extensively documented by spacecraft9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-292","title":"Other 292","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742578_464246053775134_5958850086261502289_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-291","title":"Other 291","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742400_464902280376178_8340434939850423488_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-293","title":"Other 293","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12742666_464902050376201_1952265792957127379_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
