Top text reads 'WHAT IF THE EARTH REALLY IS CIRCULAR' and bottom text states 'AND ERATOSTHENES IS JUST AN IDIOT'. References Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-194 BC), Greek mathematician who famously calculated Earth's circumference using shadow angles from two cities (Alexandria and Syene), proving Earth is spherical. Meme humorously suggests rejecting Eratosthenes' well-established mathematical proof by questioning his intelligence rather than addressing his methodology. Plays on 'Conspiracy Keanu' format where obvious facts are questioned in absurd ways. Could be interpreted as flat Earth skepticism of ancient Greek geometry, or as satire of people who dismiss historical scientific achievements without understanding the methods used.
