5:T422,Two-panel educational meme about cosmological curvature models with white background. Top text asks 'So which shape of space do you believe in?' Shows three geometric models with black gridlines: Top sphere labeled 'BALL' with 'Spherical Universe, Constant positive curvature' and notation 'Ω₀>1' with yellow boxes showing density equations 'Ω₀ = ρ/ρc' and 'ρc = 3H²/8πG' and 'ρ > ρc'. Middle shows saddle/hyperbolic shape labeled 'TOILET PAPER ROLL' with 'Hyperbolic Universe, Constant negative curvature' and 'Ω₀<1' with yellow box 'ρ < ρc'. Bottom shows flat plane labeled 'FLAT' with 'Flat Universe' and 'Ω₀=1' with yellow box 'ρ = ρc'. Bottom panel shows photograph of calm blue ocean horizon with white text 'Choose wisely.' Presents cosmological models (spherical, hyperbolic, flat universe based on density parameters) alongside literal interpretation, with ocean horizon image suggesting observable flatness supports flat universe model. Conflates cosmological curvature of spacetime with physical flatness of Earth's surface.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Pseudo Science 26 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel educational meme about cosmological curvature models with white background.
