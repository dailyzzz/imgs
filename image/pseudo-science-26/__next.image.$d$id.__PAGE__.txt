3:T422,Two-panel educational meme about cosmological curvature models with white background. Top text asks 'So which shape of space do you believe in?' Shows three geometric models with black gridlines: Top sphere labeled 'BALL' with 'Spherical Universe, Constant positive curvature' and notation 'Ω₀>1' with yellow boxes showing density equations 'Ω₀ = ρ/ρc' and 'ρc = 3H²/8πG' and 'ρ > ρc'. Middle shows saddle/hyperbolic shape labeled 'TOILET PAPER ROLL' with 'Hyperbolic Universe, Constant negative curvature' and 'Ω₀<1' with yellow box 'ρ < ρc'. Bottom shows flat plane labeled 'FLAT' with 'Flat Universe' and 'Ω₀=1' with yellow box 'ρ = ρc'. Bottom panel shows photograph of calm blue ocean horizon with white text 'Choose wisely.' Presents cosmological models (spherical, hyperbolic, flat universe based on density parameters) alongside literal interpretation, with ocean horizon image suggesting observable flatness supports flat universe model. Conflates cosmological curvature of spacetime with physical flatness of Earth's surface.4:T45a,Humorous meme about open-mindedness to opposing views with white background. Top text in black: 'Study finds that hearing an opposing viewpoint causes no real harm.' Below shows photograph of Asian scientist or researcher in white lab coat with light blue shirt and striped tie, sitting in laboratory/office setting with computer, equipment, microscopes visible in background. Researcher appears to be explaining something with hand gestures, water bottle on desk. Person in background working at desk. Satirical commentary suggesting that despite scientific evidence showing exposure to opposing viewpoints is harmless, many people act as if contrary opinions are dangerous or harmful. Can be interpreted as critique of echo chambers, intellectual fragility, or cancel culture. In flat Earth context, might be used to argue mainstream science refuses to consider alternative theories about Earth's shape, or conversely that flat Earthers should be open to globe Earth evidence. Meme format implies ironic disconnect between scientific findings about open dialogue and actual practice of dismissing opposing views.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-26","title":"Pseudo Science 26","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/38474490_1770722136298215_6802765637476155392_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-25","title":"Pseudo Science 25","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/37243155_1983072245036951_3882111060706066432_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-27","title":"Pseudo Science 27","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/39027551_1827516517325001_442898797090045952_n.jpeg","description":"Meme using Renaissance portrait of Nicolaus Copernicus with dark background. Shows Copernicus in red robe with dark fur collar, black hat, holding astronomical instrument, characteristic Renaissance facial features with slight smile. Top text in large white letters: 'COPERNICUS'. Bottom text: 'OPEN CIRCUS'. Simple pun/wordplay meme mocking Copernican heliocentric model by breaking name into 'OPEN CIRCUS', implying heliocentric astronomy is circus act or absurd performance rather than legitimate science. Dismisses Copernicus's revolutionary astronomical work through ridicule, suggesting Sun-centered solar system model is theatrical fraud. Part of flat Earth rhetoric rejecting heliocentric cosmology and returning to geocentric worldview."}}],null,"$L5"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
