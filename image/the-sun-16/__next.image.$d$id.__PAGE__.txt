Top panel shows nighttime residential street scene with streetlight illuminating road with warm orange glow, labeled 'DAY' under lit area and 'NIGHT' in dark areas beyond light's reach. Bottom panel shows similar street scene with streetlight creating circular pool of yellow light on pavement, again labeled 'DAY' in illuminated area and 'NIGHT' in surrounding darkness. Large white text reads 'HOW A SMALL LOCAL SUN CAN CREATE DAY AND NIGHT' with '@flatworldlogic' watermark. Uses streetlight analogy to explain flat Earth day/night cycle: small, close sun acts like spotlight moving over flat Earth plane, illuminating local area (creating day) while areas outside light cone remain dark (night). Presents alternative to Earth's rotation explanation, arguing local sun with limited illumination radius can create observable day/night pattern on stationary flat surface"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-15","title":"The Sun 15","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/23de4c5fe41ea2554d8d11100b9a0a1d.png","description":"Meme showing dramatic ocean sunset scene with sun rays (crepuscular rays) breaking through thick storm clouds over water. White text at top reads 'THE SUN IS JUST ABOVE THESE CLOUDS IF IT WAS 93 MILLION MILES AWAY' and bottom text states 'THE RAYS WOULD BE COMING THROUGH THE OPEN SPACES TO THE LEFT...END OF STORY!' Argues that visible convergence of sun rays (crepuscular rays) from right side of clouds proves sun is close and local rather than 93 million miles away. Suggests if sun were distant, light rays should appear parallel and illuminate cloud gaps on left side equally. Uses atmospheric optical effect of crepuscular rays converging toward light source as evidence against astronomical distance measurements. Actually demonstrates perspective: parallel light rays from distant sun appear to converge due to perspective, similar to railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-17","title":"The Sun 17","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/264352589_354724063125553_8971260636080269064_n.jpeg","description":"Stunning sunset photograph over ocean with sun half-descended below horizon, creating dramatic scene with vibrant colors. Sky displays gradient from deep teal at top through coral pink and golden orange near horizon, with layered clouds illuminated in brilliant gold and purple. Bright white semicircle of sun sits precisely at horizon line, casting golden reflection path across calm water surface toward viewer. Orange and blue atmospheric layers create striking color contrast. Dark clouds with golden-edged outlines stretch horizontally across sky. Photo credit: © Jose Rivera. High-quality nature photography often used in flat Earth discussions to question how sun can appear to set below horizon if Earth is flat, though image actually demonstrates Earth's spherical geometry through curved horizon obscuring bottom half of sun"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":"$L4"}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
