3:T4b1,Stunning aerial landscape photograph from mountain/elevated viewpoint with flat Earth messaging. Shows dramatic coastal scene - left side features massive layered sedimentary rock cliff face with tan, brown, and gray horizontal strata visible. Mountain extends down slope covered in green vegetation. Right side shows brilliant turquoise-blue ocean water meeting dark coastline with white wave breaks visible along shore. Small coastal town/settlement visible at base of mountain with white buildings clustered together. Ocean extends to perfectly flat horizon line under bright blue sky with scattered white wispy clouds. Sunlight creates beautiful atmospheric perspective. Top text in large white letters with subtle shadow: 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. Center text: 'RESEARCH IT!' in white outlined letters. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses spectacular natural beauty to attract attention to flat Earth message. Horizon appears flat in photograph (as it would from any viewpoint regardless of Earth's shape). Encourages viewers to independently investigate rather than accept mainstream narrative. Juxtaposition of beautiful landscape with controversial message creates cognitive dissonance4:T41f,Dr. Evil meme from Austin Powers questioning NASA budget allocation. Shows Mike Myers as Dr. Evil character wearing iconic light blue-gray suit with high collar, bald head. Character holds pinky finger to corner of mouth in signature gesture with satisfied smirk expression. Blurred gray-blue background suggests lair/headquarters setting. Top text in bold white letters with black outline: 'NASA'S BUDGET FOR 2016'. Bottom text: '19.3 BILLION DOLLARS...' with ellipsis suggesting suspicion about fund usage. Bottom left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Meme uses Dr. Evil's character (comedic villain known for exaggerated ransom demands and evil schemes) to suggest NASA's budget is excessive or fraudulently obtained. Implies massive government funding goes toward maintaining space exploration deception rather than genuine science. Question mark hanging over dollar amount suggests money is being misused or embezzled. Uses comedy villain to make NASA seem cartoonishly evil rather than legitimate scientific organization5:T45e,Whimsical illustrated poem in Shel Silverstein style about flat Earth edge. White background with black ink line drawings. Title at top: 'THE EDGE OF THE WORLD'. Poem text reads: 'Columbus said the world is round? / Don't you believe a word of that. / For I've been down to the edge of the world, / Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled, / Peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls, / And I can tell you, boys and girls, / The world is FLAT!' Illustration shows flat Earth edge scene with various whimsical elements: left side shows city skyline with buildings and church spires, signpost reading 'THE EDGE', floating objects suggesting items falling off edge, running dog or creature, fire hydrant, trash can, figure sitting/peering over edge on right side. Playful sketch style with loose pen strokes. Bottom right: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Uses children's poetry format to present flat Earth in accessible, non-threatening way. References Columbus myth while claiming first-hand experience of world's edge. Whimsical tone makes controversial topic seem innocent and imaginative rather than confrontational0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-153","title":"Other 153","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12471743_455240954675644_7637157316831754820_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-152","title":"Other 152","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12466283_454476978085375_7688683053710238504_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-154","title":"Other 154","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12472260_455802364619503_7030039292681837275_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
