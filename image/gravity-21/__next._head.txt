5:T435,Complex alternative physics diagram comparing diamagnetism versus gravity. Top left shows flat Earth model with dome and text 'THE SUN AND MOON ARE CAUGHT IN EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD' with green magnetic field lines and caption explaining 24-hour rotation. Top right shows similar dome with downward magnetic force labeled 'THE MAGNETIC FIELD ALSO HAS A DOWNWARD FORCE' explaining diamagnetism as substitute for gravity. Middle section titled 'DIAMAGNETISM (VS) MASSES BENDING SPACE:' shows three panels: left with mouse being repelled by magnets labeled 'MOUSE IS REPELLED IN REAL-TIME' referencing diamagnetism, center showing diagram of curved spacetime grid with arrows and 'OBSERVER MUST STAND BACK & RELY ON MEASUREMENT' labeled 'CAVENDISH!', right showing clock and Nikola Tesla quote about space curvature being incorrect. Bottom shows Newton quote describing aether as medium through which light flows and magnetic field is distributed, concluding 'Earth's magnetic field is the aether.' Proposes diamagnetism and magnetic fields explain phenomena attributed to gravity.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 21 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Complex alternative physics diagram comparing diamagnetism versus gravity.
