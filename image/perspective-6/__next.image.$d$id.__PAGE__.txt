3:T4c1,Multi-panel educational diagram explaining ship perspective and angular resolution. Top banner text with yellow highlight: 'The "sinking" appearance of a departing ship relative to the observers horizon is due to Perspective and Angular resolution where we become unable to distinguish between the ship and the horizon'. Top panel shows silhouette sequence of cargo ship becoming progressively smaller approaching horizon with sun in background, text 'Bottom of ships disappear'. Middle panel shows real photograph of naval fleet at sea with arrow pointing to ships with text 'Bottom of ships disappear'. Third panel titled '#AngularResolution' shows three progressively smaller spheres on beige surface demonstrating size/distance relationship. Bottom panel shows three circular images with decreasing resolution demonstrating optical limitation. Bottom text: 'Angular resolution or spatial resolution describes the ability of any image-forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye, to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of image resolution'. Argues ships appear to sink due to perspective and optical limits, not Earth curvature.4:T42f,Complex educational infographic with black background titled 'WHY CAN'T I SEE CHINA OR MOUNT EVEREST?' at top in white text. Subtitle in smaller text: 'OH? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD SEE THROUGH BUILDINGS, HILLS, MOUNTAINS, 100 FOOT WAVES, DENSE WEATHER, HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS, POLLUTION, FOG, MIST, DUST PARTICLES, DENSE FLUID AIR, ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION AND LENSING, MAGNIFICATION AND SUPERIOR MIRAGE EFFECTS!' Four photographs illustrate atmospheric effects: top left shows hazy city skyline with person's silhouette, top right shows misty mountain layers, bottom left shows snowy landscape barely visible in whiteout conditions, bottom right shows hazy ocean horizon. White text sections: 'OR EVEN EYE-LEVEL HORIZONTAL RATE OF CONVERGENCE AND VANISHING POINT, DEPTH PERCEPTION, RAMPED AND LINEAR PERSPECTIVE, ANGULAR RESOLUTION AND PYRAMIDAL PERSPECTIVE!' and 'OR EVEN KNOWING HOW YOUR EYE VISUAL PERSPECTIVE RAMP ACTUALLY WORKS!' with 'A TRUTH TROOPER' orange logo. Argues atmospheric conditions and perspective laws limit visibility, not Earth curvature.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"perspective-6","title":"Perspective 6","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/31739985_384284028740155_1959433929488334848_n.jpeg","description":"Simple educational diagram titled 'Perspective & Vanishing Point' on light blue background showing dome-shaped area labeled 'sky we can see' (light blue) and darker triangular section labeled 'sky we can't see' separated by horizon line, illustrating how perspective limits visible sky beyond the vanishing point"},"prevImage":{"id":"perspective-5","title":"Perspective 5","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/23658833_1888925117803013_8062538782921398910_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"perspective-7","title":"Perspective 7","category":"perspective","categoryDisplay":"Perspective","src":"/images/gallery/perspective/36350552_194136414623090_7503961542954582016_n.jpeg","description":"$4"}}],null,["$","$L5",null,{"children":["$","$6",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@7"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
