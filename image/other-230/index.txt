13:T592,Space Shuttle with propaganda quote over Earth photograph. Shows Space Shuttle orbiter in low Earth orbit against dramatic Earth backdrop. Shuttle appears in white with black heat-resistant tiles on underside, distinctive delta wing shape, open cargo bay visible with golden/tan colored equipment or satellite inside. Vehicle shows NASA markings. Background displays stunning Earth view from orbit - curved horizon shows atmosphere's blue glow/limb, cloud patterns in white swirls, blue oceans, landmasses in tan-brown-green visible below. Sun illumination creates bright white glare on Earth's surface. Curvature of Earth clearly visible across top of image. Top portion shows white text quote: 'Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.' Quote commonly misattributed to Joseph Goebbels (Nazi propaganda minister) but actual origin uncertain - similar sentiment appears in Hitler's Mein Kampf about 'big lie' technique. Bottom displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Image suggests space program and Earth imagery represent 'big lie' - simple message (Earth is globe) repeated constantly through education, media, NASA imagery until accepted as truth. Ironically uses actual space photograph to argue space imagery is propaganda. Claims mainstream cosmology employs psychological manipulation rather than empirical evidence. Compares NASA to totalitarian propaganda apparatus14:T5bf,Child with globe on head educational indoctrination image. Shows young boy standing in classroom in front of green chalkboard. Boy appears age 7-9, has short brown hair, wears light blue collared button-up shirt. Most striking element: standard desktop globe positioned directly on top of his head like hat - globe shows blue oceans, tan-brown-green continents, sits on traditional bronze/gold stand base. Boy's expression appears serious, slightly confused, looking toward camera with wide eyes and neutral mouth. Hands raised at sides in uncertain gesture. Background shows teal-green chalkboard with white frame, worn and marked from use. Side walls visible in gray-blue color. Top of image displays large white bold text: 'INDOCTRINATION'. Center shows translucent 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Bottom text in white letters reads: 'Because when something is true and correct, it must be hammered into the brains of defenseless children'. Image criticizes public education system for teaching globe Earth model to children before they develop critical thinking skills. Globe physically placed on child's head symbolizes forced imposition of worldview. Argues if Earth really were sphere, children would naturally discover this through observation rather than requiring repeated instruction. Claims educational system indoctrinates rather than educates. Suggests starting education with globe Earth as given fact prevents independent inquiry into Earth's actual shape15:T5b1,Challenger crew comparison photo suggesting survivors. Shows official 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger STS-51-L crew photograph in black and white. Seven astronauts in NASA flight suits pose in two rows - four standing in back row, three kneeling in front holding helmets. American flag with stars visible upper left. Crew members wear blue NASA jumpsuits with mission patches, name tags. Shuttle model visible bottom left. Image overlaid with circular insets showing color photographs of faces - several crew members have white-bordered circular photos superimposed showing older individuals allegedly identified as same people decades later. Top text reads: 'The "Challenger crew"- 30 years on?' One circle contains only question mark suggesting missing person. Conspiracy theory claims Challenger crew members survived 1986 explosion and are living under different identities. Proponents point to people with similar names and appearances working in academia and other fields. Arguments cite lack of visible aging in some cases, similar facial features, matching names. However, investigation shows these are different people with coincidentally similar names. Theory suggests Challenger disaster was staged false flag event. Mainstream history confirms all seven crew members perished when external tank exploded 73 seconds after launch on January 28, 1986. Debris and remains were recovered. Families held funerals. Theory disrespects victims and families9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-230","title":"Other 230","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662595_462748497258223_1786959743404400_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-229","title":"Other 229","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12661939_460924460773960_4001955883715102484_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-231","title":"Other 231","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662663_458878110978595_3003324589013974460_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
