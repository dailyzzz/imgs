3:T4b4,NASA Blue Marble Earth photograph with annotations pointing out alleged copy-paste duplications. Shows classic spherical Earth image with deep blue oceans, white cloud formations, and green-brown landmass visible (appears to be Central/South America). Top text in white bold letters: 'NASA'S BLUE MARBLE EARTH IMAGE' and 'CTRL + C, CTRL + V' (keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste). Image marked with colored boxes and circles highlighting supposedly identical cloud patterns in different locations across photograph. Red rectangular boxes outline cloud formations on left side. White rectangular boxes mark patterns near bottom center. Purple circles with 'Ps' (Photoshop) indicators mark suspicious areas in upper portions. Cyan/turquoise rectangular boxes highlight patterns in middle and right sections. Yellow circles mark additional questionable areas on right side. Green rectangle marks clouds near visible landmass. Bottom watermark 'fb.com/fematters'. Argues NASA's iconic Blue Marble photograph contains cloned/duplicated cloud patterns, suggesting digital manipulation rather than authentic photograph. Implies Earth images are computer-generated composites rather than real photos from space4:T476,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Coriolis Effect. Title at top reads 'The Coriolis Effect' in elegant gray font. Top panel shows military sniper in white winter camouflage and face covering looking through scope of large tactical rifle with suppressor, lying in prone shooting position. Snow or winter environment visible. White text overlay: 'SAYS THE EARTH SPINS UNDER A SNIPER'S BULLET'. Bottom panel shows vibrant collection of colorful hot air balloons floating in clear blue sky - including yellow/blue striped balloon on left, orange/black striped large balloon in center, blue balloon with stars, red balloon, balloons in various colors (yellow, green, blue, red, orange patterns). White text overlay: 'BUT IT DOESN'T SPIN UNDER THESE BALLOONS?' Attribution 'Nick Havok' in cyan at bottom right. Meme argues if Coriolis Effect (Earth's rotation affecting moving objects) requires snipers to compensate for Earth's rotation when shooting long distances, then stationary hot air balloons should drift due to same rotation. Questions why balloons don't experience apparent motion if Earth rotates beneath them while suspended in air0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-121","title":"Other 121","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10931148_487801094752963_857489831761663229_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-120","title":"Other 120","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/10683691_467318053467934_3913188074027476010_o.jpg","description":"Cast Away movie meme featuring Tom Hanks with wild unkempt hair and beard, mouth wide open in excited exclamation, pointing enthusiastically at camera with index finger. Expression shows extreme excitement and joy of discovery. Blurred tropical background with palm fronds visible suggests deserted island setting from film where character survives plane crash alone. Top text in bold white letters: 'WHEN YOU DISCOVER FLAT EARTH'. Center shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' logo watermark. Bottom text: 'FOR THE FIRST TIME'. References Cast Away plot where isolated character discovers ways to survive, comparing that sense of profound discovery to learning about flat Earth theory for first time.
