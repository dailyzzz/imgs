5:T497,Office Space meme mocking pear-shaped Earth explanation. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) in iconic scene from 1999 comedy. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, red suspenders, yellow tie with animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug, has condescending smirk expression. Blurred office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, beige walls. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'IF NASA COULD SHOW ME THAT PEAR SHAPED OBLATE SPHEROID'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'TrueEarthFlatEarth'. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate speak ('that would be great') to mock NASA's pear-shaped Earth claims. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is oblate spheroid (slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator) which he described as 'pear-shaped' causing controversy. Flat Earth proponents seized on this as admission Earth photos don't match actual shape, demanding to see actual pear-shaped Earth. Meme's sarcastic tone suggests NASA cannot produce such image because it doesn't exist. Uses office comedy context to portray NASA as incompetent bureaucracy making excuses0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 178 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Office Space meme mocking pear-shaped Earth explanation.
