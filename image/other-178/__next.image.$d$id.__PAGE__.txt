3:T497,Office Space meme mocking pear-shaped Earth explanation. Shows Bill Lumbergh character (played by Gary Cole) in iconic scene from 1999 comedy. Lumbergh wears light blue dress shirt, red suspenders, yellow tie with animal print pattern, large-framed glasses. Holds white coffee mug, has condescending smirk expression. Blurred office background with cubicles, fluorescent lighting, beige walls. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'IF NASA COULD SHOW ME THAT PEAR SHAPED OBLATE SPHEROID'. Bottom text: 'THAT WOULD BE GREAT'. Bottom left watermark 'TrueEarthFlatEarth'. Uses Lumbergh's passive-aggressive corporate speak ('that would be great') to mock NASA's pear-shaped Earth claims. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is oblate spheroid (slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator) which he described as 'pear-shaped' causing controversy. Flat Earth proponents seized on this as admission Earth photos don't match actual shape, demanding to see actual pear-shaped Earth. Meme's sarcastic tone suggests NASA cannot produce such image because it doesn't exist. Uses office comedy context to portray NASA as incompetent bureaucracy making excuses4:T47e,Universal Pictures logo parody reading 'UNIVERSAL LIE'. Black starry space background with blue nebula clouds. Center shows illuminated spherical globe Earth with city lights visible on night side, blue oceans and green-brown continents on day side. Bright white-yellow sun rising behind Earth creating lens flare and atmospheric glow. Large white metallic 3D text with chrome/silver effect reads 'UNIVERSAL LIE' in Universal Pictures studio logo font style, with trademark circle-R symbol. Text arcs above and around Earth mimicking iconic movie studio opening. Bottom shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in semi-transparent text. Parodies Universal Pictures' famous logo/intro showing spinning globe with company name. Replaces 'Universal' with 'Universal Lie' to suggest globe Earth model is worldwide deception perpetuated by media/Hollywood. Implies entertainment industry complicit in maintaining heliocentric lie through constant subliminal messaging. Uses familiar cinematic branding to make point that movies/TV condition masses to accept spherical Earth without question. Argues Hollywood serves as propaganda arm for globe Earth narrative5:T52a,Two-panel cartoon of laughing globe Earth character reading flat Earth news. Left panel: anthropomorphized blue globe Earth with grid lines (latitude/longitude), white continents visible. Earth character has cartoon face with eyes, big grinning smile showing teeth, extended red tongue laughing. Blue arms hold newspaper titled 'DAILY NEWS' with headline: 'Yes There Are Still People Who Believe Earth Is Flat.' Globe tilted back laughing with motion lines showing shaking. Bottom right 'JM' logo on shirt/body. Right panel: Same globe character now shocked/horrified expression - wide open mouth screaming, bulging eyes, sweat drops flying off. Holds different newspaper titled 'BREAKING NEWS!' with headline 'For scientists to break off some EVIDENCE call us at NO!' Motion lines show violent shaking/trembling. Bottom right 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark. Satirical comic suggests mainstream/globe believers initially laugh at flat Earth but panic when asked for proof. Left panel represents confident ridicule of flat Earth believers. Right panel shows existential crisis when challenged to provide evidence for globe model. Argues those who mock flat Earth cannot defend their own beliefs when questioned. Implies cognitive dissonance when globe believers realize they accepted Earth's shape on faith without evidence0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-178","title":"Other 178","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512672_483382441861495_7999342294974040002_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-177","title":"Other 177","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12512544_462324730633933_6184343257982206791_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-179","title":"Other 179","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12513554_460155257517547_5025456840721782473_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
