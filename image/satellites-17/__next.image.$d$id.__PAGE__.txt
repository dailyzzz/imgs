Large partially-deflated white weather balloon or satellite balloon lies on grass near street with yellow caution tape marking scene. Palm trees, power lines, residential homes, parked cars, and person standing nearby visible. Equipment appears to have crashed or landed in neighborhood. CBS San Francisco and EARTHISAPLANE watermarks visible. Bottom text: 'THEY'RE FLOATING ON BALLOONS, NOT IN ORBIT AROUND A BALL'. Presents crashed satellite balloon as evidence that satellites are high-altitude balloon platforms rather than orbiting spacecraft, suggesting 'satellites' are actually tethered or free-floating balloons in stratosphere rather than space-based technology."},"prevImage":{"id":"satellites-16","title":"Satellites 16","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/68685903_10218398921661600_1919508570634715136_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme titled 'TRUE STORY' comparing NASA technology from 1964 vs 1969. Left panel shows 'NASAs first communication satellite launches in 1964' with black and white photograph of large spherical metallic balloon satellite labeled 'N.A.S.A.' on ground with launch infrastructure and workers visible in background. Right panel titled 'NASA 5 summers later in 1969' with thinking face emoji and double exclamation marks shows two iconic Apollo images: top shows Earth photographed from space (blue marble), bottom shows astronauts on lunar surface with American flag and lunar module. Satirical timeline suggesting NASA advanced impossibly fast from basic balloon satellite technology in 1964 to manned moon landing with complex spacecraft just 5 years later, questioning credibility of claimed rapid technological progress. Implies Moon landing may have been fabricated given limited satellite capabilities shortly before."},"nextImage":{"id":"satellites-18","title":"Satellites 18","category":"satellites","categoryDisplay":"Satellites","src":"/images/gallery/satellites/78628044_137442034348225_5099615992837832704_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel satirical meme about satellite imaging. Top panel shows white military-style drone aircraft with 'Google' branding on fuselage, sitting on ground near airfield/runway with buildings in background. Drone has distinctive bulbous nose, long wings, rear propeller, and landing gear. Bottom panel shows Dr. Evil character from Austin Powers movie (bald man in gray suit making air quotes gesture with both hands) with caption text '\"SATELLITE IMAGING\"' in white letters. Meme suggests Google Maps/Earth imagery attributed to satellites is actually captured by high-altitude drones and aircraft rather than orbital satellites, with Dr. Evil air quotes implying 'satellite imaging' is misleading marketing term for conventional aerial photography. Questions whether satellite-based Earth observation exists or if corporations use atmospheric aircraft while claiming satellite technology."}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
