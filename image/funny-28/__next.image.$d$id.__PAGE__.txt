Retro aesthetic combined with modern flat Earth talking point about lack of experimental proof for Earth's rotation. Suggests no empirical evidence exists for planetary rotation despite scientific consensus"},"prevImage":{"id":"funny-27","title":"Funny 27","category":"funny","categoryDisplay":"Funny","src":"/images/gallery/funny/54255883_10157892017770348_8356424049114480640_n.jpeg","description":"Neil deGrasse Tyson meme showing astrophysicist in characteristic pose at SXSW (South by Southwest) Interactive conference, wearing dark suit and gesturing animatedly with arm extended. Background shows 'March 7-16 Austin 2014' and 'Music Film Interactive' conference signage. Large yellow text overlay reads 'That stuff is FLAT!' in bold letters. Humorous out-of-context quote suggesting famous science communicator is admitting Earth is flat, though likely referring to something else entirely.

Top panel: speaker states 'The earth is flat'. Middle panel: audience member asks 'And how do you know that?' Bottom panel: speaker responds 'Because of how flat it is.' demonstrating tautological reasoning. Watermark shows 'Express' logo.
