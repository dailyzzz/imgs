Bright golden-yellow sun sits precisely at waterline creating perfect vertical reflection path across still water surface. Sky displays subtle gradient from gray-blue at top through peachy-beige to golden-orange near horizon with light hazy atmospheric scattering. Ocean water appears smooth and dark blue-gray with golden sun reflection stretching from horizon toward viewer as bright vertical column with rippled texture. Small waves or foam visible at bottom edge of frame on shoreline. Peaceful, minimalist composition with horizontal layers of color. Classic sunset scene demonstrating sun's position at horizon during day-night transition, often used in discussions about whether sun sets below horizon (indicating spherical Earth) or simply moves away via perspective (flat Earth model).
