Bright golden-yellow sun sits precisely at waterline creating perfect vertical reflection path across still water surface. Sky displays subtle gradient from gray-blue at top through peachy-beige to golden-orange near horizon with light hazy atmospheric scattering. Ocean water appears smooth and dark blue-gray with golden sun reflection stretching from horizon toward viewer as bright vertical column with rippled texture. Small waves or foam visible at bottom edge of frame on shoreline. Peaceful, minimalist composition with horizontal layers of color. Classic sunset scene demonstrating sun's position at horizon during day-night transition, often used in discussions about whether sun sets below horizon (indicating spherical Earth) or simply moves away via perspective (flat Earth model). Image shows sun appearing to meet horizon line suggesting geometric sunset"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-25","title":"The Sun 25","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/35650134_10156713387165288_4790563881523085312_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel image combining sunset photography with sun path diagram. Top four panels show sequence of sunset photographs over ocean from same location, with sun appearing at different positions creating hazy halo effects, coastal vegetation and water visible. Images labeled 'LP' in bottom right of photo grid. Bottom panel shows technical diagram on transparent grid background illustrating sun's apparent path across celestial sphere. Diagram labeled with astronomical terms including 'Vert' (vertical/zenith), 'Antheliv', 'Lowitz arc', '46° halo', 'Parenthely', 'Parhely circle', 'Parhely', 'Obs' (observer), 'Sun', '22° halo'. Shows various optical phenomena and geometric relationships for sun halos and atmospheric optics. Demonstrates how sun's position changes throughout day and various atmospheric optical effects (parhelia/sun dogs, halos, arcs) that can occur. Appears to document actual sun halo observation with corresponding geometric explanation of atmospheric ice crystal refraction phenomena"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-27","title":"The Sun 27","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36795489_10216135389641222_5604780129113866240_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel educational diagram comparing Eratosthenes' measurement method with solar eclipse geometry. Top panel titled 'Parallel rays of sunlight' shows curved Earth with blue surface labeled 'Alexandria'. Red parallel sun rays from right hit Earth's curved surface at angle, with two vertical sticks/gnomons shown: one casting shadow in Alexandria, another upright in Syene (no shadow). Angle 'α' marked between vertical stick and sun ray. Demonstrates Eratosthenes' 240 BC method of measuring Earth's circumference using shadow angles. Large yellow text reads 'Eratosthenes vs. Eclipse'. Bottom panel titled 'Converging rays of sunlight' shows solar eclipse diagram with sun (left), moon casting shadow cone toward Earth (right), labeled with 'PARTIAL ECLIPSE', 'TOTAL ECLIPSE', 'UMBRA', 'PENUMBRA', 'MOON', 'EARTH', with orbital paths marked. Compares parallel sun rays (used by Eratosthenes, assuming distant sun) with converging rays during eclipse, questioning consistency of solar distance model"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
