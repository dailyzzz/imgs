Left panel shows yellow corridor/hallway with red columns and ceiling lights converging toward vanishing point, demonstrating linear perspective. Right inset panel labeled 'SUN TRAIL' shows long-exposure photograph of sun's path creating diagonal light streak across evening sky with silhouetted mountains below (credited to Nick Havok). Bottom text: 'AS THE SUN MOVES AWAY, DUE TO PERSPECTIVE ON A PLANE IT APPEARS TO DROP DOWN AS IT CONVERGES AT THE VANISHING POINT'. Uses corridor perspective as analogy for how sun appears to descend toward horizon due to perspective convergence rather than actual vertical movement. Argues sunset is visual effect of perspective on flat plane, not sun moving below curved Earth horizon."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Perspective 19"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Two-panel meme titled 'HOW DOES A SUNSET WORK IF THE EARTH IS FLAT?'
