Shows vast expanse of white snow and ice extending to horizon under clear blue sky transitioning from deep blue at top to lighter blue near horizon. Ice surface appears relatively flat with subtle undulations and ridges creating texture across snowy terrain. Harsh sunlight creates shadows emphasizing ice formations. Horizon line appears straight and level where ice meets sky. Large bold white text in center reads 'ANTARCTICA IS FLAT' in impact font with black outline. Simple direct message using photographic evidence of Antarctic terrain appearing flat to naked eye. Argues ground-level view of Antarctica shows no curvature, supporting flat Earth model. Image emphasizes observable flatness of ice shelf/landscape despite Antarctica's position on spherical Earth's bottom in mainstream model.
