13:T4b7,Historical 'Gleason's New Standard Map of the World' from 1892, famous azimuthal equidistant projection often cited in flat Earth discussions. Top header reads 'GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD' with subtitle 'ON THE PROJECTION OF J. S. CHRISTOPHER MODERN COLLEGE OF "IT IS" BLACKHEATH, ENGLAND.' Left side shows 'LONGITUDE AND TIME CALCULATOR' panel. Right side shows 'PATENT ALLOWED November 1892' with listing of countries (England, France, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Chili). Large circular map with North Pole at center, continents radiating outward. Continents color-coded: pink (Europe, parts of Asia), yellow (Asia, Australia), green (Africa, South America), with blue oceans. Outer ring in bright red marked with Roman numerals I through XII representing time zones. Bottom shows two smaller circular diagrams labeled 'JUNE SOLSTICE' (left) and 'DECEMBER SOLSTICE' (right) illustrating sun's path. Map includes latitude/longitude grid lines. Bottom text: 'PUBLISHED BY THE BUFFALO ELECTROTYPE AND ENGRAVING CO. BUFFALO N.Y., U.S.A.' This map projection is scientifically accurate for aviation/navigation but used by flat Earth proponents as evidence of true Earth shape14:T560,Grid collage of 8 different NASA Earth photographs from various years questioning inconsistencies in Earth's appearance. Black background. Top text in white: 'Come on NASA* make your mind up, what does the earth really look like?' Images arranged in two rows of 4. Top row: 1975 (pale blue marble with swirling white clouds, brown landmasses), 2015 (Blue Marble with bright blue oceans, white clouds, visible continents), 2007 (deep blue with white cloud swirls, green-brown land), 1997 (vivid blue with bright white clouds, green continents). Bottom row: 2007 (darker tones, brown Australia prominent), 2013 (pale appearance with white clouds, visible Africa/Europe), 2012 (bright blue with Americas visible), 2002 (deep blue with green landmasses). Right side label 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom text: '*ALL IMAGES ARE OFFICIAL NASA PICTURES OF EARTH, AS RELEASED THROUGH THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS AND MAJOR NEWS AGENCIES OF THE WORLD. QUESTIONS: HOW BIG IS AMERICA? WHAT COLOUR ARE THE OCEANS, AND THE LAND? WHY IS THERE NEVER ANY REAL VIDEO OF THE EARTH SPINNING, ONLY STILLS? WHY ARE THE IMAGES SO VARIED? DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?' Points out dramatic variations in continent sizes, ocean colors (pale blue to deep blue), cloud coverage, and land tones across different NASA releases, questioning authenticity and consistency of space photography9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-138","title":"Other 138","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12375116_446583322208074_4764068951087523623_o.jpg","description":"Minimalist photograph of Antarctic ice landscape with bold text overlay.
