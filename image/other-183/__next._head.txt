5:T4d2,Rosetta/Philae comet landing mission infographic from European Space Agency. Educational diagram showing November 12, 2014 landing sequence of Philae lander on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Black space background with stars. Top left shows Rosetta orbiter and Philae lander separation. White text: 'Philae operational after a difficult landing'. Center shows large gray irregular-shaped comet (potato/duck-shaped) with rough rocky surface texture. Three numbered yellow boxes mark events: '1. 15:33 - Hits the surface at 1m/s in planned location, Two anchor harpoons fail to deploy, First bounce'. '2. 17:26 - Second bounce, Displaced 1km from point of impact'. '3. 17:33 - Immobilisation, Leaning at 30% angle, Stuck in rocky zone partly in shadow'. Curved dotted lines show bounce trajectory. Speed annotations '38 cm/s' and '3 cm/s'. Bottom shows gray cratered surface with blue Philae lander and 'camera' label. Right sidebar lists technical details about mission status, scientific instruments, data transmission, battery, solar panels. Lower right text 'Use of drill put on hold'. First spacecraft to land on comet nucleus. Historic achievement in space exploration demonstrating orbital mechanics and rendezvous capabilities0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 183 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Rosetta/Philae comet landing mission infographic from European Space Agency.
