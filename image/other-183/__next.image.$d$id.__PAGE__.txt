3:T4d2,Rosetta/Philae comet landing mission infographic from European Space Agency. Educational diagram showing November 12, 2014 landing sequence of Philae lander on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Black space background with stars. Top left shows Rosetta orbiter and Philae lander separation. White text: 'Philae operational after a difficult landing'. Center shows large gray irregular-shaped comet (potato/duck-shaped) with rough rocky surface texture. Three numbered yellow boxes mark events: '1. 15:33 - Hits the surface at 1m/s in planned location, Two anchor harpoons fail to deploy, First bounce'. '2. 17:26 - Second bounce, Displaced 1km from point of impact'. '3. 17:33 - Immobilisation, Leaning at 30% angle, Stuck in rocky zone partly in shadow'. Curved dotted lines show bounce trajectory. Speed annotations '38 cm/s' and '3 cm/s'. Bottom shows gray cratered surface with blue Philae lander and 'camera' label. Right sidebar lists technical details about mission status, scientific instruments, data transmission, battery, solar panels. Lower right text 'Use of drill put on hold'. First spacecraft to land on comet nucleus. Historic achievement in space exploration demonstrating orbital mechanics and rendezvous capabilities4:T4b8,Space photography Hollywood basement conspiracy meme. Black space background. Upper portion shows International Space Station (ISS) with distinctive white/gray modules, gold solar panel arrays extending outward, various components and structures visible against black void. Lower portion shows Space Shuttle orbiter in white with black heat tiles, distinctive delta wing shape, tail vertical stabilizer, approaching or near curved Earth showing blue oceans, white clouds, brown-green landmasses. Top text in bold white letters: 'SPACE MAY BE THE FINAL FRONTIER'. Bottom text: 'BUT IT'S MADE IN A HOLLYWOOD BASEMENT.' References Red Hot Chili Peppers song 'Californication' lyrics about Hollywood's manufactured reality. Argues all space imagery (ISS, shuttle, Earth photos) is filmed in movie studios rather than actual space. 'Hollywood basement' suggests low-budget deception - not even main soundstage but basement. Implies space program is entertainment production rather than scientific endeavor. Questions authenticity of all NASA/space agency imagery as special effects and CGI rather than real photography from orbit. Connects space exploration to Hollywood's history of creating convincing illusions5:T4aa,R.E.M. song lyric meme about paradigm shift acceptance. Dramatic CGI image of Earth experiencing catastrophic destruction. Shows spherical globe Earth split/cracking with bright orange-yellow flames and explosions erupting from surface. Left side appears mostly intact showing blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents. Right side consumed by fire with massive plumes of orange flames and smoke. Bright yellow-white explosion/sunburst effect on right edge. Black starry space background with scattered stars and subtle nebula clouds visible. Top banner in gray serif font: 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Center shows large black serif text: 'IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL FINE'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. References R.E.M.'s 1987 song 'It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)' about accepting major changes. Applied to flat Earth context, suggests discovering Earth is flat means end of mainstream worldview but person feels liberated rather than distressed. Uses apocalyptic imagery of Earth's destruction to represent shattering of globe Earth paradigm. Argues flat Earth awakening destroys old belief system but brings peace through truth rather than fear0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-183","title":"Other 183","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525322_455841524615587_7426993136374706724_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-182","title":"Other 182","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12524295_458833000983106_1675931569722510132_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-184","title":"Other 184","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12525328_460139877519085_6793993696164180013_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
