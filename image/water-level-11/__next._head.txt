Both panels display same photograph of deep blue ocean with small two-masted sailboat on horizon under light blue sky with scattered white clouds. Top panel labeled 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in black text. Bottom panel labeled 'NOT SEA CURVE' in black text. Images appear identical, emphasizing point that ocean surface appears perfectly flat and level at horizon, not curved. Simple visual argument that terminology 'sea level' accurately describes observable reality (flat/level water surface), while 'sea curve' would be inaccurate description since no visible curvature can be observed. Uses wordplay to highlight that even mainstream terminology acknowledges water's levelness. Sailboat provides scale reference showing distant horizon appears as straight flat line where ocean meets sky, with no visible drop or curvature despite distance"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Water Level 11"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Two-panel comparison meme showing identical ocean scenes with different labels.
