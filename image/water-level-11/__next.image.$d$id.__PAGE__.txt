3:T43d,Educational meme about the Nile River with aerial photograph and wordplay. Header 'THE NILE' in white text, followed by green text: 'A RIVER THAT FLOWS NORTH OVER 4,000 MILES AGAINST THE SUPPOSED CURVE OF THE GLOBE. THIS IMPOSSIBILITY FURTHER PROVES THE EARTH IS FLAT AND WATER ALWAYS FLOWS DOWNHILL TO FIND ITS LEVEL'. Main image shows stunning aerial view of winding Nile River cutting through green landscape with agricultural fields visible on both sides. River appears as bright blue meandering path through lush green terrain under blue sky with white clouds. Bottom section shows large text 'DE-NIAL' (pun on 'denial' and 'the Nile'), followed by smaller text 'WHEN YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THIS FACT AND CHOOSE TO BELIEVE YOU LIVE ON A GIANT SPINNING BALL'. Photo credit 'Nick Havok'. Argues that Nile River flowing northward for 4,000+ miles contradicts spherical Earth model because water should not be able to flow 'uphill' over curved surface. Claims river's ability to flow such distance proves Earth is flat plane where water simply flows downhill following gravity to seek level0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-11","title":"Water Level 11","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18447588_125962204632470_7584539329049491921_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme showing identical ocean scenes with different labels. Both panels display same photograph of deep blue ocean with small two-masted sailboat on horizon under light blue sky with scattered white clouds. Top panel labeled 'IT'S SEA LEVEL' in black text. Bottom panel labeled 'NOT SEA CURVE' in black text. Images appear identical, emphasizing point that ocean surface appears perfectly flat and level at horizon, not curved. Simple visual argument that terminology 'sea level' accurately describes observable reality (flat/level water surface), while 'sea curve' would be inaccurate description since no visible curvature can be observed. Uses wordplay to highlight that even mainstream terminology acknowledges water's levelness. Sailboat provides scale reference showing distant horizon appears as straight flat line where ocean meets sky, with no visible drop or curvature despite distance"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-10","title":"Water Level 10","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/18402993_1403563083015348_933471735534434861_n.jpeg","description":"Meme featuring person standing in shallow ocean water wearing blue tie-dye or gradient shirt, facing camera with serious expression. Ocean horizon visible in background with calm blue water and light cloudy sky. Top text reads 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND.' Middle text states 'AND WATER ALWAYS SEEKS TO BE LEVEL.' Bottom text asks 'SO WTF IS CURVING?' with red text credit 'SHADOW THUNDERCLOUD'. Person appears to be partially submerged up to waist/chest level in water. Presents logical argument: if water naturally seeks level (demonstrable physical property), and Earth is 71% water, then Earth's surface should be predominantly flat/level rather than curved. Questions how majority-water planet can have curved surface when water's fundamental property is to maintain level horizontal surface. Uses ocean backdrop to emphasize vast quantities of supposedly level water covering Earth"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-12","title":"Water Level 12","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/23519351_376084966173386_5095148856683849441_n.jpeg","description":"$3"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
