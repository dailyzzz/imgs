3:T489,Mobile phone screenshot showing 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE' comparison chart with black background. Title in white 'SCIENCE' and cyan 'PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Left column 'SCIENCE' lists in white text: 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. Right column 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' lists in cyan: 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'SoyceCrashCourse' logo. Status bar shows 70% battery, 11:28 time. Defines characteristics distinguishing legitimate science from pseudoscience methodology.4:T4c6,Four-panel collage meme titled 'We Live in a Theory Tale' showing major scientific theories presented as unproven narratives. Top left: 'THE BIG BANG THEORY' detailed infographic with orange/space background showing timeline from Big Bang through cosmic evolution, formation of galaxies, stars, planets with technical diagrams and labels. Top right: 'The Theory Of Evolution' showing classic evolution progression illustration - green frog, blue fish, gray ape, purple early human, red modern human walking in sequence. Bottom left: 'Isaac Newton's Theory of Gravity' showing long-haired person (possibly portraying Newton) holding apple against green nature background with moon visible, with 'WHAT' text overlay suggesting incredulity. Bottom right: 'Heliocentric Theory' diagram showing solar system with Sun at center, orbital paths of planets (Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury) in white lines on black space. Bottom text 'We Live in a Theory Tale' implies Big Bang, Evolution, Gravity, and Heliocentric model are all just theoretical stories rather than established science, emphasizing 'theory' to suggest they're unproven beliefs rather than scientific frameworks supported by evidence.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-19","title":"Pseudo Science 19","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/28056294_10159931981790403_1106138291938487496_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with CGI rendered Earth showing day/night terminator, city lights on dark side, blue oceans, green/brown continents, white clouds, sun rays on left side, black space with stars.
