3:T832,Armed astronaut with conspiracy symbols suggesting NASA military connection. Composite image implying NASA is military operation rather than civilian space agency. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'DON'T FORGET...' Upper left shows three symbol images stacked vertically: American flag (red and white stripes, blue field with white stars), Freemason square and compass emblem (blue compass with gold/yellow square, letter 'G' in center on radiating blue star pattern), NASA logo (blue circular 'meatball' insignia with white NASA text, red chevron, white stars, orbital trajectory). Right side shows astronaut in full white spacesuit standing against cloudy gray-blue sky background. Astronaut wears reflective helmet visor (tinted dark/black), white Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) with American flag patch on shoulder, life support backpack, various hoses and equipment connections. Most striking element: astronaut holds what appears to be assault rifle or similar weapon across chest in tactical grip position - highly unusual imagery as astronauts don't carry firearms in space. Weapon appears to be AR-style rifle with scope/optics mounted. Lower left shows NASA logo again. Bottom text in large bold white letters: 'NASA IS A BRANCH OF THE MILITARY'. Lower right shows 'Nick Havok' signature. Meme suggests conspiracy: NASA subordinate to military/Freemasonry rather than independent civilian agency. Implies space program serves military purposes, conceals true activities. Armed astronaut imagery suggests militarization of space, threat/enforcement role. Freemason symbol implies secret society control. However, NASA established 1958 as civilian agency under National Aeronautics and Space Act explicitly stating peaceful purposes. While NASA works with Department of Defense on some projects and many early astronauts were military pilots, agency operates under civilian government oversight with transparent budgets, public missions, international cooperation. Armed astronaut image is obviously fabricated composite - astronauts never carry weapons in space4:T954,Flatbook Cosmology inner shell diagram with esoteric and alchemical symbolism. Complex infographic showing compartmentalized flat Earth model with mystical elements. Title at bottom in gray italics: 'FLATBOOK COSMOLOGY' with subtitle 'THE INNER SHELL'. Dark background with gray double-border frame. Central circular diagram shows flat Earth disc with blue ring (firmament/dome) viewed from above. Black interior shows continents in dark with subtle geographic outlines. White triangular mountain at center labeled 'THE HOLY MOUNTAIN' with small star above. Colored triangular symbols arranged around mountain: red downward triangle at bottom, pink/magenta triangles on sides, blue/green triangles, suggesting alchemical or esoteric directional markers. Circular band around disc labeled 'WATER ABOVE' at top semicircle. Section below mountain labeled 'THE UNDERWORLD'. Numerous labeled elements radiate outward with lines connecting to specific features: Upper left: Orange sun icon labeled 'SUN - THE FATHER & CONVERTER'. Upper area: Concentric circles labeled 'PLANETS' with orbital rings. Upper left quadrant: Yellow star labeled 'POLARIS - THE LODESTONE'. Top center: Yellow lightning bolt labeled 'PIEZOELECTRICITY'. Upper center: Beige semicircle with buildings/cityscape silhouette labeled 'WHITE WORK - FIRMAMENT'. Right side upper: Small TV/screen icon labeled 'GLASS SKY - ELECTROMAGNETIC LIGHTBULB'. Upper right: Crescent moon icon labeled 'MOON - THE CATHODE' with smaller moon phases. Far right: Small blue Antarctica icon. Lower right: Blue Earth sphere labeled 'ELECTRIC FLAT EARTH'. Right middle: Diagram showing 'CELESTIAL AXIS' with '23° INCLINATION' marked. Lower area: Red text 'RED WORK - LIFE ON EARTH'. Lower left: Spiral shell illustration labeled 'THE SHELL - THE EGG'. Bottom left: Gray symbols labeled 'BLACK WORK - PUTREFACTION'. Cosmology blends multiple esoteric traditions: alchemical color stages (Nigredo/black, Albedo/white, Rubedo/red), sacred geometry, electric universe theory, biblical cosmology, hermetic principles. Suggests Earth as cosmic egg within layered shell structure with electric/electromagnetic properties. References piezoelectricity, glass sky dome concept, electric Earth theory. However, model conflicts with observable physics, satellite communications, GPS functionality, circumnavigation, planetary motions, gravity measurements5:T805,Bob Ross painting fake globe Earth meme. Humorous image macro using beloved TV painter Bob Ross to suggest Earth imagery is fabricated art. Image shows Bob Ross in his iconic pose from 'The Joy of Painting' PBS television series. Ross wears light blue button-up shirt, stands beside easel holding wooden palette with paint colors in left hand, paintbrush in right hand. He has distinctive large curly afro hairstyle (dark brown), full beard, warm friendly smile. Background shows his painting studio with windows, white walls, painting supplies visible. On easel canvas displays painting of Earth from space - Blue Marble-style image showing spherical planet with blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents (appears to show North and South America). Painting looks photorealistic in style matching NASA Earth imagery. Upper left corner shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in white text. Bottom text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'LET'S JUST PAINT A FAKE LITTLE GLOBE IN THERE'. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Meme plays on Bob Ross's famous gentle phrases from his show ('happy little trees', 'happy little clouds') applying them to suggest NASA Earth images are literally paintings rather than photographs. Implies space agencies create artistic renderings and present them as authentic photos. Suggests deception - 'fake little globe' painted for propaganda purposes. However, Earth images come from multiple independent sources over 60+ years: Apollo missions, International Space Station, dozens of weather satellites, communications satellites, various nations' space programs (USA, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India), commercial satellites, astronauts from 40+ countries. Thousands of images from different angles, seasons, times, cameras all showing same spherical Earth. While some images are composites (multiple satellite passes stitched together) or enhanced for visibility, they're based on real photographic/sensor data, not paintings. Bob Ross himself would have appreciated actual beauty of Earth from space0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-297","title":"Other 297","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744346_468089603390779_1314065774518848703_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-296","title":"Other 296","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744307_464902377042835_3470945716002811040_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-298","title":"Other 298","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12744462_466915816841491_4527401067199396542_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
