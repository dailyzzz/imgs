Top panel titled 'Parallel rays of sunlight' shows curved Earth with blue surface labeled 'Alexandria'. Red parallel sun rays from right hit Earth's curved surface at angle, with two vertical sticks/gnomons shown: one casting shadow in Alexandria, another upright in Syene (no shadow). Angle 'α' marked between vertical stick and sun ray. Demonstrates Eratosthenes' 240 BC method of measuring Earth's circumference using shadow angles. Large yellow text reads 'Eratosthenes vs. Eclipse'. Bottom panel titled 'Converging rays of sunlight' shows solar eclipse diagram with sun (left), moon casting shadow cone toward Earth (right), labeled with 'PARTIAL ECLIPSE', 'TOTAL ECLIPSE', 'UMBRA', 'PENUMBRA', 'MOON', 'EARTH', with orbital paths marked. Compares parallel sun rays (used by Eratosthenes, assuming distant sun) with converging rays during eclipse, questioning consistency of solar distance model"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-26","title":"The Sun 26","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36686740_266223047266545_5058305824858832896_n.jpeg","description":"Serene sunset photograph over calm ocean showing sun touching horizon. Bright golden-yellow sun sits precisely at waterline creating perfect vertical reflection path across still water surface. Sky displays subtle gradient from gray-blue at top through peachy-beige to golden-orange near horizon with light hazy atmospheric scattering. Ocean water appears smooth and dark blue-gray with golden sun reflection stretching from horizon toward viewer as bright vertical column with rippled texture. Small waves or foam visible at bottom edge of frame on shoreline. Peaceful, minimalist composition with horizontal layers of color. Classic sunset scene demonstrating sun's position at horizon during day-night transition, often used in discussions about whether sun sets below horizon (indicating spherical Earth) or simply moves away via perspective (flat Earth model). Image shows sun appearing to meet horizon line suggesting geometric sunset"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-28","title":"The Sun 28","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/36873932_1917093435247981_5668267923366477824_n.jpeg","description":"Educational meme with black background questioning heliocentric model's etymology. Top section contains white text: 'Heliocentric is the model where the earth goes around the sun. The term was first used by the Pathagorean cult in 200 BC after it returned to Greece from Egypt. Helios in the ancient Egyptian is Horus, the sun god. Centric means center. So heliocentric means centered on the god Horus. We are being taught a 2200 year old cultic, math worshiping religion as science.' Bottom section shows large red text 'And this doesn't concern you at all?' alongside orrery-style physical model with yellow sun sphere, green/turquoise planetary spheres on wire orbital paths mounted on stand. References provided: 'http://www.edenics.net/english-word-origins.aspx?word=HELIOCENTRIC' and 'http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html'. Argues heliocentric model has occult/religious origins tied to ancient Egyptian sun worship, suggesting scientific astronomy is disguised paganism rather than empirical science"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
