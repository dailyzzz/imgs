Grid shows dome/flat Earth models from: Greek, Navajo, Babylonian, Mesa, Japanese, Persian, Viking, Indian, Mayan, NASA (showing standard globe Earth photo), Incan, Hebrew, Australian, Slavic, Chinese, Celtic, Chumash, Masonic, African, Sumerian, Islamic, Roman, Egyptian. Bottom text reads 'IT'S THE PSYOP' suggesting NASA's globe Earth is psychological operation contradicting all ancient cultural cosmologies which depicted flat/domed Earth.

Top row displays three pyramid structures: green moss-covered Indonesian temple with stepped pyramid, limestone Mayan pyramid in Mexico with steep stairs, and weathered Egyptian pyramid with eroded surface. Middle row shows two feathered serpent deity carvings: gray stone Balinese serpent head with ornate feathers and fangs, and turquoise-green Mayan Quetzalcoatl serpent head with elaborate feather crown. Bottom row presents two temple complexes: Balinese multi-tiered stone temple with symmetrical staircases and ornate gates, and Mayan stepped pyramid with stone serpent head sculptures at base. Labels identify cultures as INDONESIA, MEXICO, EGYPT, BALINESE, MAYAN.
