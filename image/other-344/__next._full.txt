13:T1515,ISS spacewalk photograph with photoshopped additions claiming all space activities are fake. Composite meme image showing apparently authentic ISS (International Space Station) spacewalk photograph digitally altered with satirical/conspiracy elements. Background shows spectacular view of Earth from orbit - predominately blue oceans visible covering most of visible hemisphere, white cloud formations scattered across surface creating swirling patterns, landmasses visible in browns and greens, distinctive curved horizon line where Earth's limb meets black space, thin blue atmospheric layer visible as slight glow at horizon. Earth fills lower two-thirds of frame showing dramatic orbital perspective. Upper third shows black void of space. Center left shows astronaut in white EVA (Extravehicular Activity) spacesuit conducting spacewalk. Astronaut in classic NASA EMU suit with white fabric outer layer, gold-tinted sun visor visible on helmet reflecting light, American flag patch visible on shoulder, various equipment and tethers attached to suit. Astronaut positioned upside-down relative to frame (common in microgravity where "up" is arbitrary). Suit shows realistic details - gloves, joints, equipment pouches, safety tethers. Right side of frame shows ISS structural components - white/silver cylindrical modules, solar panel arrays with distinctive rectangular panels in geometric grid patterns, various mechanical structures, radiators, trusses creating lattice framework. ISS hardware shows realistic detail with shadows, highlights, metallic surfaces. Earth's illumination consistent with sun angle creating shadows on station components. PHOTOSHOPPED ADDITIONS: Center of image shows astronaut appearing to hold small rectangular sign/placard with beige/tan background containing text in italicized serif font: "It's all FAKE" - deliberately placed as if astronaut is confessing space activities are hoax. Sign held at chest level. Upper right corner shows completely incongruous element: Tinker Bell character from Disney's Peter Pan - small fairy with blonde hair, green dress, wings, flying pose, rendered in typical Disney animation style. Tinker Bell appears golden/yellow glowing as in original animations, positioned against space background as if "flying" near ISS. Inclusion is absurdist humor suggesting space/fantasy are equivalent. Text overlays: top of image in large bold white letters with black outline reads "THE YEAR WAS 2015" setting temporal context. Bottom text in similar style: "WHEN I REALIZED IT WASN'T JUST THE MOON LANDINGS" - suggests narrator's awakening/revelation moment. Lower right attribution: "fb.com/fematters". Meme narrative presents personal awakening story: person initially believed moon landings were faked (common conspiracy theory) but still accepted other space activities (satellites, ISS, space shuttle) as real. Then in 2015, they realized ALL space activities are fabrications - moon landings were just beginning, entire space program is hoax. "It's all FAKE" sign represents confession or exposed truth. Tinker Bell inclusion reinforces "fairy tale" theme - suggesting space exploration is fantasy fiction like Peter Pan, not real science. Implies astronauts are actors, ISS doesn't exist, Earth photos are CGI, entire space industry is elaborate theater production. However, extensive evidence confirms ISS reality: 1) Visible to naked eye as bright object crossing sky in ~90-minute orbit, predictable via tracking apps, 2) Amateur astronomers photograph ISS transiting sun/moon showing detailed structure matching official images, 3) Radio operators communicate with crew via ham radio, 4) Continuous international cooperation since 2000 (USA, Russia, EU, Japan, Canada, plus visiting nations) - geopolitical adversaries wouldn't maintain decades-long hoax, 5) Thousands of photographs and hours of video showing consistent microgravity physics, 6) Scientific experiments conducted producing published research, 7) Commercial cargo missions (SpaceX Dragon, Northrop Grumman Cygnus, Boeing Starliner) dock with station, 8) Cost over $150 billion - economically unsustainable for fake program. Photograph quality suggests authenticity - consistent lighting, accurate hardware details, proper Earth view from orbital altitude (~250 miles), realistic shadows and highlights. Adding "FAKE" sign and Tinker Bell doesn't change underlying evidence photograph shows real scene. Meme's 2015 timeframe significant - roughly when flat Earth movement experienced major internet growth via YouTube conspiracy videos. Many flat Earthers describe 2014-2016 as period of awakening after watching videos claiming to "prove" Earth is flat, space is fake. Narrative arc common in conspiracy communities: gradual awakening from accepting mainstream view, to questioning specific events (moon landings), to wholesale rejection of entire paradigm (all space fake). Pattern reflects escalating conspiracy belief where accepting one conspiracy theory makes person susceptible to accepting many others. Psychology: once person invests identity in being "awake" to moon landing hoax, cognitive dissonance makes it easier to extend skepticism to all space activities rather than maintain nuanced position. Tinker Bell adds mocking dismissive tone - space exploration as childish fantasy requiring belief in impossible things, like fairy dust and flying.14:T11f6,"Real eyes realize real lies" conspiracy wordplay meme with globe Earth reflected in human eye. Artistic photograph showing extreme close-up of human eye with spherical Earth reflected in pupil/iris. Image uses selective color technique - entire photograph in black and white grayscale except Earth reflection which appears in full color. Creates dramatic striking visual isolating Earth as focal point. Eye dominates frame - fills most of image showing detailed structure. Visible anatomy includes: thick black eyelashes in top left and bottom right corners framing eye, upper eyelid edge visible at top with fine wrinkles/texture in monochrome, lower eyelid barely visible at bottom. Iris shows detailed circular muscle structure radiating from pupil with intricate patterns resembling starburst - darker gray tones with lighter striations creating texture. Pupil at center appears black in natural eye but contains colorized Earth reflection. Pupil shows photographic image of Earth from space - blue marble view showing spherical planet with blue oceans (deep navy/royal blue), white cloud swirls, green-brown continental landmasses. Earth appears as perfect sphere reflecting in curved surface of eye's lens. Reflection creates nested spheres - spherical Earth within spherical eyeball within spherical iris. Cornea surface shows slight glossy highlight/catchlight suggesting light source from above or front. Sclera (white of eye) visible minimally at edges appears grayish in monochrome treatment. Skin texture around eye visible showing pores, fine lines, natural texture all in grayscale. Image creates powerful metaphor: Earth/world as seen/perceived by individual is reflected in their eye - what you see is what you believe. Text overlays in large bold white letters with black outlines for readability: top of image reads "REAL EYES REALIZE" in all caps, bottom reads "REAL LIES" in all caps. Together forms wordplay aphorism: "REAL EYES REALIZE REAL LIES" - homophone pun where "REAL EYES" sounds like "REALIZE" and connects to "REAL LIES." Message operates on multiple levels: 1) Only authentic vision ("real eyes") can understand ("realize") genuine deceptions ("real lies"), 2) Those who truly see/observe with clarity can recognize falsehoods others miss, 3) Globe Earth visible in eye is one of "real lies" - major deception accepted as reality. Lower left attribution: "fb.com/fematters" in white text. Phrase "real eyes realize real lies" is popular in conspiracy theory communities, truth-seeker movements, and pseudo-philosophical social media posts. Used across many conspiracy topics beyond flat Earth - government coverups, false flags, media manipulation, corporate deception. In flat Earth context specifically, meme suggests: globe Earth image literally reflected in human eye/consciousness is lie planted by education/media/NASA. What masses "see" (globe Earth) is programmed illusion rather than objective observation. True enlightened vision ("real eyes") allows one to "realize" (understand/awaken to) the "real lies" (fundamental deceptions like globe Earth). Image structure reinforces message - Earth appears as reflection, not actual object. Reflections are secondary images, not reality itself. Suggests globe Earth is mere reflection/illusion/representation rather than actual shape of world. Selective color draws eye to Earth while rest remains monochrome, emphasizing Earth as "false color" or artificial construct standing out from natural vision. However, meme's logic is self-defeating: if Earth reflection in eye is "real lie," image proves eyes DO show spherical Earth - exactly what science claims. Photograph demonstrates globe Earth is literally what eyes see/reflect when viewing space photography. Scientific reality: Earth's sphericity isn't belief or interpretation - it's directly observable fact verified through navigation, satellite imagery, physics, and personal observation experiments. Every photo from sufficient altitude shows curved horizon. Ships disappear hull-first over horizon. Different stars visible from different hemispheres. Time zones. Seasons. Foucault pendulum. These aren't "lies eyes see" but consistent empirical observations. Wordplay's rhetorical power comes from memorable phrase structure, feeling of profound insight, and assumption that questioning mainstream narratives equals wisdom. Similar to "question everything" or "wake up" slogans - sounds enlightened but provides no specific evidence or logical argument. Image is propaganda piece using visual impact and wordplay rather than evidence-based reasoning.15:Tf32,"Airplane" visual wordplay meme with aircraft flying above clouds. Photograph showing commercial aircraft in flight against dramatic sky and cloudscape with text labels creating literal definition. Upper two-thirds displays clear deep blue sky with slight gradient from darker blue at top to lighter blue toward horizon. Sky appears pristine with no visible clouds at altitude. Middle section shows Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in profile view flying left to right across frame. Aircraft displays distinctive features: white fuselage with blue/navy livery design, swept-back wings with pronounced dihedral angle and distinctive raked wingtips (787's signature curved winglet design), twin turbofan engines mounted under wings in nacelles, T-tail configuration visible, cockpit windows showing dark tint. "Boeing" text visible on fuselage side. Aircraft appears to be at cruising altitude based on smooth flight attitude and cloud layer below. Lower third shows dramatic cloudscape below aircraft - thick layer of white cumulus clouds creating textured blanket stretching to horizon. Clouds show three-dimensional structure with peaks, valleys, shadows creating topographical effect. Cloud layer suggests aircraft is above weather at typical cruising altitude (35,000-40,000 feet). Text overlays create visual definition: large bold white letters with black outline at top of image spell "AIR" positioned in sky area above aircraft. Below aircraft, horizontal double-headed arrow spans across frame pointing left and right with dashed line in center, suggesting horizontal plane or level flight path. At bottom, large bold white letters with black outline spell "PLANE" positioned over cloud layer. Visual joke operates on multiple levels: 1) Literal wordplay: "AIR" + "PLANE" = "AIRPLANE" - meme breaks down compound word into component parts showing literal air and plane separately. Simple linguistic humor explaining what airplane means by showing its parts. 2) May contain subtle flat Earth subtext: horizontal arrow emphasizes "plane" as flat level surface, and phrase "air plane" could suggest aircraft travel on flat air plane rather than curved surface. Flat Earth arguments often claim flight paths prove flat Earth because pilots fly level routes without constantly nose-down correction for curvature. However, aircraft maintain altitude relative to sea level using altimeters (barometric pressure), not geometric level relative to Earth's center. Flight computers account for Earth's curvature in long-distance navigation. 3) Simple visual definition meme format popular for explaining obvious concepts in deliberately over-literal way for humorous effect. Similar formats exist for other compound words. Image quality suggests professional aviation photography - proper exposure, sharp focus on aircraft, dramatic cloud composition. Boeing 787 Dreamliner is advanced wide-body jet featuring composite construction, improved fuel efficiency, passenger comfort enhancements. Distinctive swept wings and raked wingtips reduce drag. Aircraft entered service 2011 and represents cutting-edge commercial aviation technology. Photograph captures essence of modern air travel - sophisticated machinery enabling routine high-altitude flight above weather. Cloud layer below emphasizes altitude separation between ground and flight level. From pilot perspective, flying "above the weather" provides smooth conditions. Clouds themselves follow Earth's curvature, though imperceptible at human scale. Meme's simplicity makes it highly shareable - requires no technical knowledge to understand basic wordplay. Whether intended as pure humor or subtle flat Earth reference depends on context and audience interpretation. In flat Earth communities, emphasis on "plane" (flat surface) resonates with belief system. In mainstream context, simply amusing visual pun breaking down familiar word.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-344","title":"Other 344","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802962_471998116333261_4737530837366777279_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-343","title":"Other 343","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12802953_471673723032367_4433121116093448291_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-345","title":"Other 345","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12804784_468754359990970_7564901699568001271_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
