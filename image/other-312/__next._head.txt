5:T8f1,AI-generated children studying flat Earth azimuthal equidistant projection map. Digital artwork showing diverse group of children examining flat Earth model in futuristic educational setting. Five children gathered around table studying illuminated flat Earth map displayed on tilted stand resembling decorative globe mount. Children appear ages 8-12, showing racial diversity - mix of skin tones from light to dark. All wear matching gray-blue uniforms with green glowing circuit-pattern designs on sleeves suggesting futuristic/sci-fi school setting. Girl on left with braided hair points at map with finger, appears engaged. Three children stand/lean over map from various angles. Girl on right with ponytail wearing green earrings observes. All show curious, focused expressions studying the map. Central focus: azimuthal equidistant projection map showing flat Earth disc with North Pole at center. Map displays blue oceans, yellow-green-brown continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia visible radiating from center), white ice around perimeter representing Antarctica. Map mounted on brass/golden colored gimbal-style stand with degree markings around outer ring, suggesting navigational instrument. Small spherical objects attached to mount possibly representing sun and moon. Map surface illuminated with glowing effect. Background shows institutional setting with teal-blue brick walls, yellow-green neon light strip on wall creating atmospheric lighting. Visible emblem or logo on wall (left) showing globe with orbital rings and text. Wooden table surface. Lower left shows 'DDees.com' signature indicating digital art origin. Image appears AI-generated based on slight uncanny valley characteristics, overly smooth skin textures, slightly imperfect anatomy, perfect uniformity of clothing, idealized futuristic aesthetic. Artwork presents flat Earth education in positive, progressive light - suggesting advanced future where children learn 'truth' about flat Earth. However, azimuthal equidistant projection shown is legitimate cartographic projection of spherical Earth (used by UN logo, aviation planning, radio communications) - represents mathematical transformation of 3D sphere onto 2D plane for specific purposes, not proof of flat Earth0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 312 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"AI-generated children studying flat Earth azimuthal equidistant projection map.
