13:T8f1,AI-generated children studying flat Earth azimuthal equidistant projection map. Digital artwork showing diverse group of children examining flat Earth model in futuristic educational setting. Five children gathered around table studying illuminated flat Earth map displayed on tilted stand resembling decorative globe mount. Children appear ages 8-12, showing racial diversity - mix of skin tones from light to dark. All wear matching gray-blue uniforms with green glowing circuit-pattern designs on sleeves suggesting futuristic/sci-fi school setting. Girl on left with braided hair points at map with finger, appears engaged. Three children stand/lean over map from various angles. Girl on right with ponytail wearing green earrings observes. All show curious, focused expressions studying the map. Central focus: azimuthal equidistant projection map showing flat Earth disc with North Pole at center. Map displays blue oceans, yellow-green-brown continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia visible radiating from center), white ice around perimeter representing Antarctica. Map mounted on brass/golden colored gimbal-style stand with degree markings around outer ring, suggesting navigational instrument. Small spherical objects attached to mount possibly representing sun and moon. Map surface illuminated with glowing effect. Background shows institutional setting with teal-blue brick walls, yellow-green neon light strip on wall creating atmospheric lighting. Visible emblem or logo on wall (left) showing globe with orbital rings and text. Wooden table surface. Lower left shows 'DDees.com' signature indicating digital art origin. Image appears AI-generated based on slight uncanny valley characteristics, overly smooth skin textures, slightly imperfect anatomy, perfect uniformity of clothing, idealized futuristic aesthetic. Artwork presents flat Earth education in positive, progressive light - suggesting advanced future where children learn 'truth' about flat Earth. However, azimuthal equidistant projection shown is legitimate cartographic projection of spherical Earth (used by UN logo, aviation planning, radio communications) - represents mathematical transformation of 3D sphere onto 2D plane for specific purposes, not proof of flat Earth14:T9fc,Bruce Lee water philosophy meme adapted for flat Earth argument about water taking container shape. Black and white photograph of martial arts legend Bruce Lee with modified version of his famous 'be like water' philosophy applied to flat Earth claims. Top text in large white letters with gray outline: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Image shows professional studio portrait of Bruce Lee - young Asian man with distinctive short dark hair, intense focused gaze, strong features, wearing light colored button-up collared shirt and dark striped tie. High contrast black and white photography creates dramatic effect emphasizing his serious, contemplative expression. Background plain gray. Text overlay on right side in white with gray outline: 'If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.' Line break, then: 'You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. You put water on a ball, it falls off.' Quote modifies Bruce Lee's iconic philosophy from interview/documentary where he described adaptability using water metaphor: 'Be water, my friend.' Original quote explained water's ability to conform to any container, flow around obstacles, crash through barriers - representing martial arts philosophy of adaptation and formlessness. This version adds final line 'You put water on a ball, it falls off' to suggest water cannot conform to spherical surface, therefore Earth cannot be sphere. Classic flat Earth argument about water adhering to curves. However, modification misunderstands both Bruce Lee's philosophy and physics. Water DOES conform to spherical surfaces when gravity acts toward center. On Earth-sized sphere, gravity pulls water molecules toward core creating curved ocean surface that appears locally level. Water in cup/bottle/teapot conforms due to gravity pulling down plus container walls constraining laterally. On sphere, water conforms due to gravity pulling radially inward toward center - no container walls needed. Small amounts of water on basketball-sized ball fall off due to surface tension being too weak to overcome gravity pulling straight down, but on planetary scale, gravity's radial pull toward center keeps oceans attached. Water on Earth curves following spherical surface - demonstrated by ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across large bodies of water beyond geometric horizon. Misappropriating Bruce Lee's philosophy for flat Earth argument contradicts his actual message about adaptation, flexibility, understanding nature's principles15:Ta34,One Does Not Simply Boromir meme about water sticking to spinning ball Earth. Popular internet meme format using Sean Bean as Boromir from Lord of the Rings. Top text in large bold white letters with black outline: 'WATER DOES NOT SIMPLY'. Image shows close-up of actor Sean Bean in character as Boromir from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has shoulder-length brown hair with some strands across face, beard stubble, weathered appearance. Wears medieval-style clothing with leather/fabric armor visible at collar. Expression shows characteristic condescending, skeptical look associated with this meme format - slightly smirking, knowing gaze, hand raised near face in contemplative gesture making circle with thumb and forefinger (OK gesture or pinching motion). Background shows warm golden-orange blurred tones suggesting firelight or torch-lit indoor setting from film. Lower right shows 'JM' signature. Center displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom text in matching bold white letters: 'STICK TO A BALL SPINNING 1000 MPH'. Meme format originates from Boromir's famous line 'One does not simply walk into Mordor' - template used to express that complex tasks aren't as simple as stated. In this context, suggests water adhering to spinning spherical Earth isn't simple physics. Argument claims if Earth spins at 1,000 mph (equatorial rotation speed), centrifugal force should fling water off surface. However, this misunderstands scale and forces involved. Earth's circumference at equator is ~24,901 miles, rotating once per 24 hours = ~1,037 mph surface speed. But rotation is smooth and constant - no acceleration felt. Centrifugal acceleration at equator only ~0.034 m/s² versus gravity's 9.8 m/s² - nearly 300 times weaker. Gravity easily overcomes tiny centrifugal effect. Water 'sticks' because gravity pulls it toward Earth's center with far greater force than outward centrifugal effect. Similar to how water in bucket doesn't fly out when bucket spun at constant speed on rope - it's pressed against bottom by centripetal force exceeding gravity. Objects only fly off if angular velocity exceeds escape velocity, which would require Earth rotating once every ~84 minutes instead of 24 hours. We don't feel 1,000 mph motion because atmosphere, oceans, everything rotates together - no relative motion. Similar to airplane passengers not feeling 500 mph flight speed. Meme format effective because Boromir's condescending expression implies obvious impossibility, but physics actually supports water adhering to spinning sphere given forces involved9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-312","title":"Other 312","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771784_470962913103448_1071833718786072481_o.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-311","title":"Other 311","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12764808_467925800073826_2315618439056180762_o.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-313","title":"Other 313","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12771861_466967416836331_6935803660984393691_o.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
