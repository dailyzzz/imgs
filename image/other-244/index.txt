13:T587,Two-panel Jurassic Park meme about Earth curvature dismissal. Shows scenes from Jurassic Park (1993) film in outdoor tropical setting with palm trees and thatched roof structures. Top panel shows two men at wooden picnic table. Left: man in red polo shirt and sunglasses. Right: larger man in colorful Hawaiian shirt with blue-pink-purple floral pattern, arms crossed, pointing and speaking with animated expression. Text overlay: 'THIS GUY'S SEEN THE CURVATURE HE'S SEEN IT!' Background shows greenery, wooden structures, tropical resort atmosphere. Bottom panel shows closer view of same scene. Left: partial view of man in red shirt. Right: same Hawaiian-shirted man now with dismissive expression, glasses visible, gesturing with hand in 'whatever' motion. Watermark visible: 'Flat Earth Matters'. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'SEE? NOBODY CARES'. References famous Jurassic Park scene where Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) dismisses John Hammond's concerns. Original scene: 'See? Nobody cares' about Dodgson's identity. Meme repurposes dialogue to mock claims of seeing Earth's curvature. Suggests even if someone claims to have observed curvature, flat Earth community dismisses it as irrelevant or fabricated. Implies personal testimony about curvature carries no weight. Uses humor to deflect mainstream evidence while reinforcing in-group consensus that curvature is unobservable14:T570,Close-up orange tabby cat with wide eyes and NASA authority meme. Shows extreme close-up photograph of orange/ginger tabby cat's face filling entire frame. Cat has large round eyes with black pupils dilated wide, creating startled or concerned expression. Eyes reflect light showing bright white highlights. Fur shows typical tabby markings - orange-tan with darker orange stripes on forehead forming 'M' pattern. Pink nose visible at bottom center. White whiskers extend from sides. Fur appears soft and well-lit showing texture. Background slightly blurred showing reddish-brown tones. Right side displays 'flat earth matters' watermark in gray translucent text. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'BUT NASA SAID SO'. Image uses cute concerned cat expression to mock appeal to NASA authority. Suggests people accept NASA claims without question simply because of institutional authority rather than evaluating evidence independently. Cat's worried expression represents someone confronted with evidence contradicting official narrative but still deferring to authority figure. Format similar to other animal reaction memes expressing cognitive dissonance or uncomfortable truths. Implies NASA statements are treated as infallible despite potential for errors or deception. Encourages viewers to question authority and trust personal observation over institutional claims15:T58c,Antarctic ice shelf formation with massive vertical ice walls and sea ice. Shows dramatic aerial photograph of Antarctic landscape from elevated perspective. Left and center dominated by massive tabular ice shelf with sheer vertical ice cliffs or walls. Ice cliff appears 50-100+ feet tall running diagonally across image, showing pristine white-blue ice with stratified layers visible in face. Wall shows irregular geometric breaks and sections where ice has fractured or calved. Top surface of shelf appears flat extending into distance. Right side and foreground shows dark navy-blue ocean water with scattered white ice fragments, brash ice, and small icebergs floating on surface. Water shows ripple patterns and darker patches. Middle distance shows larger white ice floes and tabular icebergs in various sizes scattered across water. Far background displays distant Antarctic ice formations or mountains with flat-topped profiles. Sky shows light gray-blue overcast conditions typical of polar regions with horizontal cloud layers. Horizon line visible in far distance. No text or watermarks. Pure nature photography. Image frequently shared by flat Earth community as visual evidence of Antarctic 'ice wall' that allegedly surrounds flat Earth disc perimeter, preventing water from flowing off edges and restricting access to regions beyond Antarctica. Antarctic Treaty cited as conspiracy to prevent exploration9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"other-244","title":"Other 244","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688256_462427670623639_8418095521325847670_n.jpg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-243","title":"Other 243","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688065_461821374017602_6183272085537145209_n.jpg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-245","title":"Other 245","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12688331_461770127356060_1783774617165432927_n.jpg","description":"$15"}}]
