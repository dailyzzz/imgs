5:T723,Historical scientific text excerpt discussing alternative gravity theory and curved space. Shows dense paragraph of black text on white/cream background, appears to be from older printed book or journal. Text discusses author's discoveries related to force and motion of celestial bodies. Opening line: 'During the succeeding two years of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far-reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon.' Explains theory of force causing motion of heavenly bodies under its influence. References 'kinetic idea' and 'curved space' concepts similar to relativistic theory. Describes gravitational equivalence or resemblance to reality with 'self-contradictory' aspects. Discusses how 'curved spaces must react on the bodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves.' Mentions action and reaction becoming eccentric, questioning if proposed solution is impossible. States 'Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed. Only this can explain the working of the universe without recognizing the existence of any other unexplainable function or plays in the phenomena.' Second paragraph discusses 'physical truth of the greatest importance' - 'there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.' References birthday on July 10. Mentions applying concepts 'rigorously to molecules and atoms' as well as 'largest heavenly bodies'. Discusses energy in matter drawn from environment. References radioactivity discovery in 1896 and search for external agent. Historical alternative physics theory challenging mainstream gravitational concepts, possibly pre-Einstein or alternative to general relativity0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 203 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Historical scientific text excerpt discussing alternative gravity theory and curved space.
