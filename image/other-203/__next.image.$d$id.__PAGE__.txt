3:T723,Historical scientific text excerpt discussing alternative gravity theory and curved space. Shows dense paragraph of black text on white/cream background, appears to be from older printed book or journal. Text discusses author's discoveries related to force and motion of celestial bodies. Opening line: 'During the succeeding two years of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far-reaching discoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very soon.' Explains theory of force causing motion of heavenly bodies under its influence. References 'kinetic idea' and 'curved space' concepts similar to relativistic theory. Describes gravitational equivalence or resemblance to reality with 'self-contradictory' aspects. Discusses how 'curved spaces must react on the bodies and, producing the opposite effects, straighten out the curves.' Mentions action and reaction becoming eccentric, questioning if proposed solution is impossible. States 'Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed. Only this can explain the working of the universe without recognizing the existence of any other unexplainable function or plays in the phenomena.' Second paragraph discusses 'physical truth of the greatest importance' - 'there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.' References birthday on July 10. Mentions applying concepts 'rigorously to molecules and atoms' as well as 'largest heavenly bodies'. Discusses energy in matter drawn from environment. References radioactivity discovery in 1896 and search for external agent. Historical alternative physics theory challenging mainstream gravitational concepts, possibly pre-Einstein or alternative to general relativity4:T646,Aerial photograph of K2 mountain casting enormous shadow across China. Shows stunning high-altitude view of Karakoram mountain range at sunset or sunrise. Sky displays gradient from pale blue-white upper atmosphere to warm peachy-orange glow at horizon with scattered white-pink clouds. Center shows massive snow-covered mountain peak (K2, second-highest peak on Earth at 28,251 feet) with dramatic triangular shadow projection extending hundreds of miles into distance. Shadow appears as dark gray-blue triangular cone stretching from mountain base across landscape. Foreground shows jagged snow-covered peaks and ridges in white and gray. Mountains show striated rock faces, glacial formations, steep slopes covered in ice and snow. Distant landscape shows hazy atmospheric perspective with multiple mountain ranges fading into bluish distance. Top left displays 'fb.com/fematters' URL. Bottom shows large white bold text with black outline: 'SHADOW OF K2 PROJECTED INTO CHINA OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES'. Flat Earth proponents cite this image as evidence of local sun creating crepuscular rays (sun rays) rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Argues if sun were truly distant, shadows should be parallel, but visible convergence of shadow suggests sun is close and small. Similar logic applied to sun rays breaking through clouds - rays appear to converge at focal point suggesting nearby source. Mainstream science explains this as perspective effect - parallel lines appear to converge at vanishing point due to observer's viewpoint, same principle as railroad tracks appearing to meet at horizon5:T69d,Detailed Rosetta mission infographic showing 4-billion-mile space race to comet 67P. Black space background with colorful diagrams, text boxes, and illustrations. Large white bold title at top: 'THE 4BILLION-MILE SPACE RACE'. Left side shows mission timeline with numbered stages: '1) Mar 2004 Launched aboard Ariane 5 from French Guiana', '2) Mar 2007 Accelerated using Mars's gravity to pick up speed', '3) Aug 6, 2014 Rendezvous attempt with Comet 67P 400million-mile journey', '4) TODAY Philae landing craft will be sent to surface of comet, 315million miles from earth'. Trajectory diagram shows red orbital paths from Earth (small blue sphere) through Mars (small red sphere) around yellow Sun, with dotted yellow lines indicating spacecraft path to comet orbit. Upper right shows detailed Rosetta spacecraft illustration with large blue-tinted solar panels and gold body. Yellow info box lists: 'ROSETTA FACTFILE Size: 10ft x 6ft x 6ft, Wingspan: 105ft, Weight: 3.3 tons, Speed: 23.4 miles/sec (84,000mph), Payload: Philae lander and a nickel disk micro-engraved with first three chapters of Genesis, microscopically engraved in 1,000 languages'. Center-bottom shows 'PHILAE LANDER FACTFILE' with yellow text listing specifications. Lower section displays gray irregular potato-shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with labeled features including 'Back-up landing site', 'Agilkia landing site', '19300ft' distance marker, and 'London to scale' size comparison. Right side shows 'COMET FACTFILE' with red/yellow text boxes listing comet properties. MailOnline credit at bottom.
