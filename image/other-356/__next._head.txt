5:T6fb,Apollo moon landing photograph with visible film set equipment suggesting studio hoax. Composite image showing Apollo moon photograph with digitally added elements (ceiling, lighting equipment, wires) to suggest scene filmed in studio. Main image shows famous Apollo photograph - lunar surface with gray regolith showing texture with rocks, craters scattered across. Left shows ALSEP scientific equipment with gold/bronze thermal blankets. Center shows Apollo astronaut in white EVA spacesuit with PLSS backpack, gold-tinted sun visor, American flag patch, working on surface. Sharp black shadows indicating single light source in airless environment. Left foreground shows American flag planted in surface appearing extended (horizontal rod keeps it extended in vacuum). DIGITALLY ADDED: Top shows film studio ceiling - wooden rafters creating grid pattern, yellowish-tan coloring. Three vertical wires/cables hanging toward astronaut suggesting wire suspension. Two crew members visible on elevated platform near ceiling. Lighting equipment visible. Addition creates impression photograph is film set with suspended actor. Text overlays: Top reads "IT'S EASIER TO FOOL PEOPLE". Bottom reads "THAN TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOOLED" - quote suggesting psychological resistance to admitting deception. Right shows "fb.com/fematters". Represents moon landing hoax theory. However, extensive evidence confirms landings were real: retroreflectors on moon still used today, LRO photographed landing sites, 842 pounds lunar rocks with characteristics impossible to fake, Soviet Union confirmed landings, thousands involved making conspiracy implausible, independent tracking confirmed transmissions from lunar vicinity, physics in footage impossible to replicate with 1960s effects.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 356 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Apollo moon landing photograph with visible film set equipment suggesting studio hoax.
