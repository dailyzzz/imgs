3:T6fb,Apollo moon landing photograph with visible film set equipment suggesting studio hoax. Composite image showing Apollo moon photograph with digitally added elements (ceiling, lighting equipment, wires) to suggest scene filmed in studio. Main image shows famous Apollo photograph - lunar surface with gray regolith showing texture with rocks, craters scattered across. Left shows ALSEP scientific equipment with gold/bronze thermal blankets. Center shows Apollo astronaut in white EVA spacesuit with PLSS backpack, gold-tinted sun visor, American flag patch, working on surface. Sharp black shadows indicating single light source in airless environment. Left foreground shows American flag planted in surface appearing extended (horizontal rod keeps it extended in vacuum). DIGITALLY ADDED: Top shows film studio ceiling - wooden rafters creating grid pattern, yellowish-tan coloring. Three vertical wires/cables hanging toward astronaut suggesting wire suspension. Two crew members visible on elevated platform near ceiling. Lighting equipment visible. Addition creates impression photograph is film set with suspended actor. Text overlays: Top reads "IT'S EASIER TO FOOL PEOPLE". Bottom reads "THAN TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOOLED" - quote suggesting psychological resistance to admitting deception. Right shows "fb.com/fematters". Represents moon landing hoax theory. However, extensive evidence confirms landings were real: retroreflectors on moon still used today, LRO photographed landing sites, 842 pounds lunar rocks with characteristics impossible to fake, Soviet Union confirmed landings, thousands involved making conspiracy implausible, independent tracking confirmed transmissions from lunar vicinity, physics in footage impossible to replicate with 1960s effects.4:T766,Flat Earth edge composite arguing space having no edge proves Earth must have edge. Elaborate digital composite artwork comparing concept of infinite space versus finite flat Earth using false dichotomy reasoning. Upper left quadrant depicts flat Earth cosmology - massive ice cliff/wall representing Antarctica as boundary. Ice wall appears as vertical cliff face hundreds of feet tall showing layered compressed ice with blue-white coloring, cracks, crevasses. Standing on top are several human figures - hikers/explorers with backpacks. Central figure stands at very edge peering over. Scale suggests ice wall is enormous - humans appear tiny. Above shows realistic sky with blue color and white cumulus clouds. Lower right quadrant shows deep space - black void filled with stars creating typical night sky. Blue nebula clouds visible creating cosmic gas formations. Small portion shows spherical Earth in lower corner showing blue oceans, clouds, landmasses as it would appear from space. Earth's presence creates ironic contradiction with flat Earth section. Central element: massive chasm/void separating sections - appears as if ice cliff drops into infinite space below. Two figures at base appearing to peer upward. Attribution "DDees.com" and "fb.com/fematters" visible. Text overlays: Top reads "IF SPACE DOESN'T HAVE AN EDGE" setting up premise. Bottom reads "WHY ASSUME THAT FLAT EARTH DOES?" Argument employs false dichotomy: because space doesn't have edge, Earth shouldn't either. However, Earth and space/universe are different categories - Earth is planetary body with measurable dimensions, space is all of existence. We can verify Earth doesn't have edge by circumnavigation - people travel around world continuously returning to start. Antarctic ice wall misrepresents Antarctica - actual continent surrounded by ocean, extensively mapped with permanent research stations.5:T16f8,Relative versus universal gravity direction infographic comparing globe and flat Earth models. Two-panel educational-style diagram contrasting how "up" and "down" work on spherical Earth versus flat Earth, arguing for universal absolute directions. Black background with white text creating stark high-contrast design. Top panel labeled "RELATIVE" shows globe Earth model. Left side displays multiple small spherical Earths arranged in circle, each showing different orientation. Each Earth shows blue oceans, green-brown continents, white clouds. From each Earth, colored arrows point in different directions indicating "up" and "down" relative to that Earth's surface. Red arrows labeled "UP" point away from Earth's surface (radially outward). Red arrows labeled "DOWN" point toward Earth's center. Green/teal arrows labeled "DOWN" also shown. Small white human figure icons positioned on some Earth surfaces showing different orientations - one standing upright, one sideways, one upside-down relative to viewer's perspective, demonstrating how "down" changes depending on location on sphere. Arrows show gravity vectors pointing toward each Earth's center from all surface points. Center shows directional indicators suggesting motion or rotation with white arrows. Right side shows large text "RELATIVE" in white capital letters emphasizing concept that directions are location-dependent on globe. Bottom panel labeled "UNIVERSAL" shows flat Earth model. Image displays classic flat Earth dome/snow globe model - circular flat disc under transparent dome. Earth disc shows continents arranged flat with North Pole at center (azimuthal equidistant projection), surrounded by ocean, Antarctica forming ice ring around perimeter. Dome over Earth rendered semi-transparent showing curve. Sun and moon visible as small luminous bodies inside dome. Flat plane appears level/horizontal. White arrows at left and right edges point upward labeled "UP" in white text with white arrows. Red arrows at left and right edges point downward labeled "DOWN" in red text with red downward arrows. Arrows indicate universal absolute directions - up is always perpendicular to flat plane upward, down always perpendicular downward toward underside of plane. No variation based on location - all points on flat Earth share same "up" and "down." Large text "UNIVERSAL" in white capital letters emphasizes concept of absolute unchanging directions. Bottom attribution "fb.com/oierraeplana" in red on white background. Diagram argues flat Earth superior because provides absolute reference frame with universal directions, while globe Earth has relative directions that change based on position. Suggests absurdity of "relative" directions where people in Australia are "upside down" relative to people in North America. Implies globe model is unintuitive or nonsensical. However, diagram misrepresents physics and creates false problem. Scientific reality: "Down" on spherical Earth is not arbitrary or confusing - it's simply direction toward Earth's center, defined by gravity. Gravity on sphere points radially inward toward center of mass. This creates consistent local reference frame at every location - "down" means toward ground, "up" means away from ground, regardless of where you are on planet. Observers at all locations experience same sensation - standing upright on ground surface with sky above. No one is actually "upside down" because "down" is defined by gravity, not by external geometric reference frame. On spherical Earth with uniform gravity, each location has own local vertical, but all verticals point toward Earth's center - this is feature, not bug. Allows consistent physics everywhere. Standing in Australia feels identical to standing in North America - both experience gravity pulling feet toward ground. "Relative" is not problem but solution - it's how physics actually works through reference frames. Flat Earth model in diagram creates actual problems diagram doesn't address: 1) If down is truly universal (same direction everywhere), gravity would need to point in same absolute direction from all locations on flat plane. This would mean gravity points toward geometric center of disc (not uniformly "down"). People near edges would experience gravity pulling them toward center, not straight down through ground. 2) Universal down contradicts observation - we measure gravity pointing perpendicular to local ground everywhere. If plane were truly flat with universal down, gravity measurements would vary with position on disc. 3) Dome model shown has no physical basis - what material is dome? What holds it up? Why does sun/moon move inside dome? How do spacecraft exit? Diagram's visual appeal comes from simplicity - flat plane with uniform directions seems intuitively easier to understand than sphere with location-dependent directions. However, intuition based on limited experience. We live on such large sphere that we experience only tiny fraction of surface at once, making it appear flat. Once scale is understood, spherical model with radial gravity is both simpler (follows from mass distribution) and matches all observations. "Relative" vs "Universal" framing is false dichotomy. Physical laws are universal - gravity always points toward center of mass. What changes is local expression of universal law. On sphere, universal gravity law creates location-dependent vertical directions. On hypothetical flat plane, same gravity law would create completely different (and non-observed) effects. Diagram essentially argues: "wouldn't it be nice if Earth were flat so directions were simpler?" But universe doesn't conform to human preference for simplicity. Actual observations (ships over horizon, different star constellations in different hemispheres, time zones, seasons, satellite orbits) all confirm spherical Earth with radial gravity.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-356","title":"Other 356","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814441_475043012695438_7139502113511027053_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-355","title":"Other 355","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814403_474986176034455_598040337757001983_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-357","title":"Other 357","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12814526_469338236599249_4584590810737124001_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
