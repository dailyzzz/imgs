3:T697,Comprehensive anti-gravity infographic with black background and three main sections. Top banner in yellow: 'GRAVITY is a false GOD' with Apollo mission patch on left and NASA logo on right. Subtitle: 'Gravity is the answer for everything the 'official experts' can't explain and doesn't make sense on a spinning ball earth'. Middle section titled 'GRAVITY' lists questions gravity supposedly answers: 'How does the earth orbit the sun? Gravity', 'Why do we stick to the spinning, ball earth? Gravity', 'Why doesn't the water fly off a ball spinning 1000 miles per hour? Gravity', 'Why does the moon orbit the earth? Gravity', 'What causes the tides? Gravity', 'Why do the wandering stars called 'planets' move in relation to the fixed stars of constellations? Gravity'. Text includes 'DON'T LET GO' with globe Earth image and United Nations logo showing azimuthal equidistant projection. Notes planets named after Roman/Greek deities (Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn). States: 'When people say 'gravity is the cause of it' they may as well say 'God is the cause of it', the belief in Gravity does not have anything to do with science but everything to do with religion.' Bottom section titled 'Assumptions of the theory of Gravity:' lists: Forms spheres in space/bending water, Creates black holes, Has separate boson (Graviton), Attracts everything with mass, Bends invisible field (space time), Bends Light, Attracts everything to centre of mass, Mass exists. Right side contains red-bordered boxes explaining these are NLP mind control assumptions using 'Pacing and Leading' technique, and that observable evidence of things falling is evidence of density, not gravity theory0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"gravity-12","title":"Gravity 12","category":"gravity","categoryDisplay":"Gravity","src":"/images/gallery/gravity/31502608_531645823897605_1534112449265926144_n.jpeg","description":"Viral 'Side-Eye Chloe' meme format featuring young blonde girl (Chloe Clem) with long hair sitting in car seat with skeptical sideways glance expression. Top text in bold white with black outline: 'SO YOU'RE SAYING'. Bottom text with rainbow gradient: 'SOMETIMES GRAVITY MAKES THINGS STICK TO STUFF, AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES IT ORBIT AROUND STUFF?' Questions inconsistency in gravity explanation - why does gravity make objects stick to Earth's surface (downward attraction) but make moon orbit around Earth (sideways motion) rather than crashing into it. Child's skeptical expression emphasizes perceived absurdity of gravity simultaneously causing adhesion and orbital motion.

White text caption with black outline: 'I Put This Bullshit on Everything...' Satirizes Tyson's role as prominent science communicator who explains mainstream cosmology including gravity. Implies he applies gravity as universal explanation for all phenomena regardless of validity, referencing perception that gravity is invoked to explain away contradictions in heliocentric model.
