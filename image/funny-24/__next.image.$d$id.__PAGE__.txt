Blue-uniformed cheerleader in center with back to camera, hair in motion. Two labeled groups: left side shows 'GLOBE LOVER' (man in suit looking disinterested), right side shows 'FLAT EARTH PROOFS' (appears as cheerleader's label). Humorous comparison suggesting flat Earth proofs are as attractive and attention-grabbing as cheerleader performing, while globe believers sit unmoved and unimpressed.
