3:T58b,Scumbag Steve meme criticizing physics evidence for globe Earth. Shows young man in indoor setting wearing tan/brown sideways scumbag hat, white t-shirt. Has somewhat dazed or smug facial expression looking slightly off-camera. Background shows beige/tan walls, Christmas tree visible with decorations and lights, typical residential interior. Light coloring and composition create casual, candid photo aesthetic. Top text in white bold Impact font with black outline: 'BELIEVES PHYSICS OFFERS EVIDENCE OF GLOBE EARTH'. Bottom left corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Bottom text in same font style: 'CAN'T PROVIDE ANY'. Bottom left shows 'imgflip.com' watermark. Uses Scumbag Steve meme format (originated 2011) depicting naive, hypocritical, or annoying person making contradictory claims. Criticizes globe Earth believers who claim physics proves spherical Earth but allegedly cannot provide convincing demonstrations. Flat Earth argument suggests mainstream science relies on abstract mathematics and theories rather than direct observable proof. Implies physics models are mathematical constructs that don't necessarily reflect reality. Questions concepts like gravity, orbital mechanics, centrifugal force as unproven assumptions rather than demonstrated facts. Reverses burden of proof by suggesting those who believe in globe model cannot actually explain or prove the physics they claim supports it4:T590,Neil deGrasse Tyson meme with 'pear-anoia' pun about Earth's shape. Shows Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and science communicator, in professional portrait against plain gray-green gradient background. Tyson wears dark navy blue suit jacket, light blue dress shirt, dark blue tie with small pattern or planets/stars design. Has characteristic wide friendly smile showing teeth, short dark hair with gray at sides, thin mustache. Both hands raised toward camera with palms facing outward in emphatic gesture or stop motion. Gold ring visible on finger. Body language suggests enthusiastic explanation or demonstration. Translucent 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark visible across chest area. Bottom text in large white bold letters with black outline: 'PEAR-ANOIA WILL DESTROYA'. Bottom right shows 'JM' signature watermark. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is not perfect sphere but actually 'pear-shaped' or 'oblate spheroid' - slightly flattened at poles, bulging at equator. Flat Earth community mocked this statement, claiming it shows inconsistency in official narrative (sometimes sphere, sometimes pear, sometimes oblate spheroid). Pun combines 'pear' + 'paranoia' suggesting Tyson's pear-shaped Earth claims will ultimately destroy credibility of mainstream astronomy. Word 'destroya' suggests Tyson's own statements undermine the globe Earth model through contradictions and overcomplications5:T4bd,Coffee latte art showing flat Earth map continents in foam. Shows overhead view of white ceramic coffee cup with handle on right side, sitting on warm-toned wooden table surface with vertical grain pattern. Cup contains dark black coffee or espresso. Surface of liquid covered with creamy tan-beige foam/crema creating latte art. Foam bubbles and milk create recognizable continental shapes resembling azimuthal equidistant projection flat Earth map. Visible landmasses include what appears to be Europe/Africa on left, Asia center-right, Americas lower portion - arranged in circular pattern radiating from center (North Pole). Smaller bubbles around perimeter could represent Antarctica ice wall or outer ring. Artistic coffee foam naturally formed or deliberately created to replicate flat Earth map layout. Aesthetic combines popular coffee culture with flat Earth imagery. Image likely shared as artistic representation, humor, or community symbolism. Shows how flat Earth map pattern has become recognizable visual motif. Could be intentional latte art by sympathetic barista or coincidental pattern interpreted as validation. Reflects way flat Earth community finds patterns and symbols in everyday objects0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-213","title":"Other 213","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12642488_461070304092709_2267447020385932588_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-212","title":"Other 212","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12640333_458537694345970_2693304563078920792_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-214","title":"Other 214","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12642859_459030870963319_3570981260198209356_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
