Top text states 'the Verrazano-Narrows bridge is 13700 feet long' and 'the curvature of the earth was taken into account when designing the bridge'. Red horizontal line drawn across water surface. Large red arrow points downward to water with text 'the water is supposed to curve with the bridge' followed by smaller text 'maybe there was an issue with gravity when this photo was made'. Questions why water appears flat/level beneath long bridge if Earth's curvature was considered in bridge design, suggesting water should visibly curve if Earth is spherical"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-1","title":"Water Level 1","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/1080.jpeg","description":"Artistic photograph with text 'Meanwhile in Australia' shown upside-down at top. Image shows silhouette of person diving or falling, captured mid-air with arms and legs extended in graceful pose against sunset/sunrise sky. Person's silhouette is reflected perfectly in still water below, creating mirror symmetry effect. Water surface shows golden-orange sunset colors with clouds reflected. Warm peachy-orange and blue tones in sky with dark rippled water. Image is vertically flipped to create humorous 'Meanwhile in Australia' effect where person appears to be falling upward from water into sky, playing on Southern Hemisphere 'upside down' stereotype. Bottom watermark 'FlatEarth101.com'. Artistic composition demonstrating perfect water reflection and level water surface, often used to illustrate concept that water always finds its level on flat plane"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-3","title":"Water Level 3","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/1440.jpeg","description":"Tropical beach paradise photograph with text overlay 'Sea Level'. Shows pristine white sandy beach in foreground with single coconut palm tree leaning at angle over turquoise-blue ocean water. Palm fronds extend gracefully toward right side. Ocean displays gradient from light turquoise near shore to deeper blue at horizon. Clear bright blue sky with white puffy clouds scattered across upper portion. Horizon line appears perfectly flat and level stretching across entire width of image. Sandy beach shows footprints and natural beach debris. Bottom watermark 'FlatEarth101.com' in green text. Image emphasizes perfectly level, flat horizon line where ocean meets sky, used to demonstrate observable flatness of water surface and question spherical Earth model. Tropical paradise setting provides unobstructed view of distant horizon over calm waters"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
