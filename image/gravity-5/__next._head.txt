5:T449,Eminem rap lyrics meme questioning gravity with dark moody photograph of person in black winter beanie and dark jacket with hood looking down contemplatively against dark background. Top quote in yellow: '"Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity."' Below in white text: 'No one has been able to drill into the earth past the 8th Mile' with '8th' highlighted in gold. Continues: 'Russia's Kola Super Deep Borehole reached 12,262 meters or 7.6 miles deep and could drill no further. The Al Shaheen Oil Field later beat this world record depth at 12,290 meters. How then do scientists 'know' what the earth's core is made of? Why can't we dig any farther? Research Flat Earth.' Bottom shows hashtags: '#Density #Buoyancy #Electromagnetism #Aether #NotGravity #GravityIsntReal #OnceYouGoFlatDotCom #Eminem'. Clever wordplay on Eminem's "Lose Yourself" lyrics combining "8th Mile" reference (his movie) with deepest drilling depth to question scientific knowledge of Earth's interior structure, suggesting gravity concept is unfounded when we cannot access Earth's core to verify composition claims0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Gravity 5 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Eminem rap lyrics meme questioning gravity with dark moody photograph of person in black winter beanie and dark jacket with hood looking down contemplatively..."}],["$","meta","2",{"name":"author","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","3",{"name":"keywords","content":"image gallery,free images,memes,space images,earth photos,perspective images,biblical images,photo gallery,image collection,high quality images,ZZZ Daily,flat earth,gravity,satellites,moon images,sun images,water level,coriolis effect,flight paths,photoshop,pseudo-science,diagrams,proofs,funny images"}],["$","meta","4",{"name":"creator","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","5",{"name":"publisher","content":"ZZZ Daily"}],["$","meta","6",{"name":"robots","content":"index, follow"}],["$","meta","7",{"name":"googlebot","content":"index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1"}],["$","link","8",{"rel":"canonical","href":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/"}],["$","meta","9",{"property":"og:title","content":"Gravity 5"}],["$","meta","10",{"property":"og:description","content":"Eminem rap lyrics meme questioning gravity with dark moody photograph of person in black winter beanie and dark jacket with hood looking down contemplatively..."}],["$","meta","11",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/gravity/15826065_10207478381067274_8850252981052033811_n.jpeg"}],["$","meta","12",{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1200"}],["$","meta","13",{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"}],["$","meta","14",{"property":"og:image:alt","content":"$5"}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Gravity 5"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Eminem rap lyrics meme questioning gravity with dark moody photograph of person in black winter beanie and dark jacket with hood looking down contemplatively..."}],["$","meta","19",{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https://images.zzzdaily.com/images/gallery/gravity/15826065_10207478381067274_8850252981052033811_n.jpeg"}]]}]}]}],null]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
