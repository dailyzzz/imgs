Top left: golden sunrise/sunset over green rolling field with dramatic light rays. Top right: bright white sun in blue sky with puffy white clouds. Center panel: Five noble gas discharge tubes showing emission spectra - He (helium - red/pink glow), Ne (neon - red/orange glow), Ar (argon - purple glow), Kr (krypton - blue/white glow), Xe (xenon - white/purple glow) with chemical symbols labeled above each tube. Bottom left: orange/red sunset over water with dark pier or jetty silhouette. Bottom right: dramatic sunset with vibrant purple and orange clouds. Appears to suggest sun's varying colors throughout day (golden sunrise, white midday, orange/red/purple sunset) could be explained by different gas compositions or local light source rather than atmospheric scattering of distant sunlight. Compares sun's color variations to noble gas discharge tubes to imply similarity in mechanism"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-12","title":"The Sun 12","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/22279504_919851108171985_7172375952944035582_n.jpeg","description":"Six-panel sunset sequence demonstrating perceived size change of sun. Top row labeled 'Watch the Sun.' shows three photographs of sun progressively descending toward horizon over landscape, maintaining relatively consistent apparent size. Bottom row labeled 'Think about the Sun.' shows three photographs where sun appears noticeably smaller and dimmer as it approaches horizon, with final panel showing sun as small orange dot. Sequence demonstrates phenomenon where setting sun appears to shrink in angular size, which is used to argue sun is moving away from observer rather than Earth rotating. Presents atmospheric refraction, perspective effects, and increased atmospheric scattering at low angles as evidence for local, nearby sun moving away horizontally rather than distant sun being obscured by Earth's curvature due to rotation"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-14","title":"The Sun 14","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/23561855_375978929517323_5405583391179254172_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel meme featuring Jim Carrey. Top panel shows photograph of Jim Carrey smiling, with quote text: 'DON'T WORRY FOLKS AS LONG AS THE SUN IS REVOLVING AROUND THE EARTH WE'LL BE FINE!' with timestamp '2:13 PM - NOV 9, 2016'. Bottom panel shows upward view through tree canopy with bright sun shining through leaves and branches creating dramatic lens flare and light rays. Uses Jim Carrey quote to promote geocentric model where sun orbits Earth rather than heliocentric model where Earth orbits sun. Quote format suggests tweet or social media post. Image presents geocentrism as reassuring or common-sense position, with bright sun photograph through trees providing visual emphasis. Note: No verified record of Jim Carrey making this specific statement exists"}}],null,["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
