13:T492,Quote meme with famous black and white portrait of Albert Einstein with characteristic wild gray hair, mustache, wearing wool sweater, looking directly at camera with gentle expression. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'We can't feel our motion through space, nor has any physical experiment ever proved that the Earth actually is in motion.' followed by attribution '• HISTORIAN, LINCOLN BARNETT, FOREWORD BY ALBERT EINSTEIN •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote attributed to Lincoln Barnett (science writer) with Einstein's endorsement via foreword, discussing perceptual and experimental challenges in detecting Earth's motion. Taken out of context - quote likely discusses principle of relativity (motion is relative to reference frame) rather than denying Earth's motion. Selective quote mining using Einstein's association to suggest even relativity theory supports stationary Earth, though Einstein's work assumes Earth orbits Sun and explains why uniform motion cannot be detected from within moving reference frame. Conflates inability to feel/measure absolute motion with claim Earth is stationary.14:T417,Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of man in glasses, white collar shirt with polka dot tie, formal suit. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'There was just one alternative; the earth's true velocity through space might happen to have been nil.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, ARTHUR EDDINGTON •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks in bottom right. Quote from Arthur Eddington (British astrophysicist famous for 1919 solar eclipse expedition confirming Einstein's general relativity) discussing theoretical possibility that Earth could have zero velocity through space, taken out of context to suggest stationary Earth. Historical context: quote likely from discussing Michelson-Morley experiment results and philosophical interpretation of reference frames, not actual endorsement of geocentrism. Eddington was prominent advocate of relativity theory. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's acknowledgment of null hypothesis as support for stationary Earth model.15:T4f3,Quote meme with black and white portrait photograph of bearded man with glasses, bow tie, and formal Victorian-era suit jacket. Large '66' in white in upper left corner. Yellow text quote: 'A great deal of research has been carried out concerning the influence of the Earth's movement. The results were always negative.' followed by attribution '• PHYSICIST, HENRI POINCARÉ •' and hashtag '#IAmSignificant' with large quotation marks. Quote from Henri Poincaré (French mathematician and theoretical physicist, founder of topology, pioneer of special relativity theory) discussing null results of experiments attempting to detect Earth's absolute motion through space (referencing Michelson-Morley and similar experiments). Quote taken out of context - Poincaré was discussing experimental basis for relativity principle, explaining that negative results led to understanding that uniform motion is relative and no absolute reference frame exists, not that Earth is stationary. His work directly contributed to Einstein's special relativity. Selective quote mining presenting physicist's description of null experimental results as denial of Earth's motion, omitting that Poincaré interpreted this as supporting principle of relativity rather than geocentrism.9:["$","$L12",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-14","title":"Pseudo Science 14","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19400126_247795952375218_613806335517901807_n.jpeg","description":"$13"},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-13","title":"Pseudo Science 13","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19396884_247796042375209_2210450211636051693_n.jpeg","description":"$14"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-15","title":"Pseudo Science 15","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/19420852_247795982375215_1772048712753929792_n.jpeg","description":"$15"}}]
