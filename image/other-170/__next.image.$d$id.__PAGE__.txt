3:T4ee,Gleason's New Standard Map of the World from 1892, famous azimuthal equidistant projection. Vintage aged paper with worn edges and stains. Top header reads 'GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD' with subtitle 'ON THE PROJECTION OF J. S. CHRISTOPHER, MODERN COLLEGE OF "IT IS" BLACKHEATH, ENGLAND.' Left side panel labeled 'LONGITUDE AND TIME CALCULATOR'. Right side shows 'PATENT ALLOWED' with list of countries and date notation. Large circular map dominates center with North Pole at center point. Continents radiate outward: pink/red (Europe, Asia portions), yellow (Asia, Australia), light green (Africa), pale yellow-green (Americas). Blue oceans with latitude/longitude grid lines. Outer ring in bright coral-pink/red marked with Roman numerals I through XII representing 24-hour time zones. Bottom shows two smaller circular diagrams labeled 'JUNE SOLSTICE' (left) and 'DECEMBER SOLSTICE' (right) illustrating seasonal sun positions. Publisher info at bottom: 'PUBLISHED BY THE BUFFALO ELECTROTYPE AND ENGRAVING CO. BUFFALO N.Y., U.S.A.' Bottom banner 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. This projection is scientifically valid for aviation/navigation but frequently cited by flat Earth proponents as historical evidence authorities once knew Earth's true flat shape4:T49f,Matrix red pill/blue pill parody with globe vs. flat Earth choice. Black background. Shows two cupped hands in monochrome white/gray tones. Left hand holds small spherical globe Earth with blue oceans, white clouds, green-brown continents visible. Right hand holds flat circular azimuthal equidistant Earth map showing blue oceans, tan/yellow continents radiating from North Pole center. Left side white text reads: 'Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know, you can't explain. But you feel it. You felt it your entire life. That there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there. Like a splinter in your mind - driving you mad.' Quote adapted from Morpheus's speech to Neo in The Matrix about choosing between comfortable illusion (blue pill) and harsh truth (red pill). Bottom left 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM'. Presents flat Earth discovery as Matrix-style awakening to reality. Globe represents comfortable mainstream lie while flat Earth map represents uncomfortable truth. Suggests those investigating flat Earth feel cognitive dissonance between official narrative and observable reality5:T494,Moon landing conspiracy meme questioning photography logistics. Shows black and white photograph supposedly from Apollo moon landing. Image displays lunar surface with gray rocky/dusty terrain in foreground. Apollo Lunar Module (LM) visible in upper right with gold/bronze metallic foil wrapping, distinctive angular shape, landing legs. Deep black space/sky as backdrop with no visible stars. Photograph appears taken from external vantage point on moon's surface showing both terrain and spacecraft. Top text in bold white letters: 'HERE IS A PICTURE OF JUST BEFORE NASA LANDED ON THE MOON.' Bottom text: 'THE ONLY PROBLEM IS.....WHO TOOK THE PICTURE?' Bottom right watermark 'mematic.net'. Conspiracy argument questions who photographed lunar module if astronauts were inside about to land. Suggests either photo is fake/staged or other entities were already on moon. Ignores explanation that photo could be from orbiting command module, previous missions, or remote cameras. Moon landing skeptics use photographic inconsistencies and logical questions to cast doubt on Apollo program authenticity. Implies NASA's moon landing narrative contains logical impossibilities0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-170","title":"Other 170","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12507547_455544007978672_592590146440083155_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-169","title":"Other 169","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12507401_453276948205378_3749273672945521973_n.png","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-171","title":"Other 171","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12508904_455108838022189_6170034040395692587_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
