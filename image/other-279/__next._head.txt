5:T87c,CGI visualization of gravitational waves from binary black hole merger. Computer-generated scientific illustration showing spacetime curvature from gravitational wave detection. Image displays 3D rendered visualization of Einstein's general relativity prediction. Dark blue-gray curved grid represents fabric of spacetime shown as flexible surface with coordinate grid lines. Grid dramatically warped into spiral depression forming funnel shape leading to center. Two small black circular objects (black holes) visible at center of deepest depression representing binary black hole system spiraling together. Concentric circular ripples emanate outward from center showing gravitational waves propagating through spacetime as massive objects accelerate. Waves create undulating wave pattern in grid surface - amplitude decreases with distance from source. Perspective view from slightly elevated angle looking into depression. Lighting creates shadowed contours emphasizing depth and curvature. Lower portion shows large cyan/light blue text: 'CGI PROVES GRAVITY WAVES ARE REAL.' Below in smaller text: 'BECAUSE 'SCIENTISTS' SAID SO.' Visualization based on LIGO's September 2015 detection of gravitational waves from two merging black holes 1.3 billion light-years away. This was groundbreaking confirmation of Einstein's 1915 prediction, earning 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Flat Earth meme mocks reliance on computer visualization rather than direct observation. Skeptics argue CGI isn't proof - just artistic interpretation of data. However, visualization illustrates real signal detected by LIGO interferometers which measured spacetime distortion of 1/10,000th proton diameter - requiring extraordinary precision. Multiple detections since 2015 from independent observatories confirm phenomenon. CGI helps visualize abstract concept but actual evidence is interferometer data, mathematical models, predictions matching observations. Visualization is educational tool, not proof itself. Similar to how medical illustrations show blood flow - real phenomenon, illustrated for comprehension. Gravitational waves require general relativity which flat Earth models reject0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 279 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"CGI visualization of gravitational waves from binary black hole merger.
