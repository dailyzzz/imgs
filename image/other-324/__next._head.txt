5:Tb52,Child blocking ears meme with Professor Brian Cox social media post about blocking conspiracy theorists. Internet meme showing frustrated child combined with screenshot mocking physicist Brian Cox's response to conspiracy theorists. Top text in large bold white outlined letters on light background: 'WHEN YOU CAN'T DEBATE THE GLOBE SO ALL YOU HAVE ARE INSULTS'. Main image shows young boy (approximately 7-10 years old) making exaggerated frustrated expression with eyes squeezed tightly shut, mouth open showing teeth in grimace of annoyance. Both hands raised with index fingers plugged into ears in classic 'I can't hear you' gesture - childish way of blocking out unwanted information. Child wears black t-shirt. White background suggests studio photograph or isolated image. Expression and pose convey refusal to listen, shutting out opposing viewpoints, immature response to disagreement. Lower portion shows Facebook post screenshot. Profile picture shows person wearing winter hat/beanie. Name reads 'Professor Brian Cox' with timestamp '9 hrs' and globe icon indicating public post. Post text reads: 'Amusing myself by blocking everyone who thinks either moon landings fake or Earth flat #futilegesturesthatneverthelessmakeushappy'. Hashtag references futile but satisfying actions. Right side shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution in black box. Meme criticizes Professor Brian Cox (British physicist, TV presenter, professor at University of Manchester, known for science communication programs like 'The Universe' and 'Human Universe') for blocking flat Earth believers and moon landing deniers rather than engaging in debate. Positions his blocking as childish refusal to discuss evidence, equivalent to child plugging ears. Implies Cox can't defend globe Earth through reasoned argument so resorts to blocking/insults. However, Cox likely blocked users not due to inability to debate, but because: 1) Professional scientists receive overwhelming volume of conspiracy theory comments making meaningful discussion impossible, 2) Most social media flat Earth debates involve bad-faith arguments, moving goalposts, rejection of evidence, 3) Cox has addressed these topics extensively in his programs and books with evidence, 4) Sometimes blocking is appropriate boundary-setting rather than admission of defeat. Cox is accomplished physicist who regularly explains evidence for spherical Earth, space exploration, physics of planetary formation. His decision to block persistent conspiracy theorists represents time management rather than inability to debate. Meme tries to position blocking as weakness when it may be reasonable response to unproductive repeated arguments. However, format resonates because condescending dismissal without engagement can feel unsatisfying to those genuinely questioning. Balance needed between patient education and boundary-setting with bad-faith actors0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 324 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Child blocking ears meme with Professor Brian Cox social media post about blocking conspiracy theorists.
