3:Tb52,Child blocking ears meme with Professor Brian Cox social media post about blocking conspiracy theorists. Internet meme showing frustrated child combined with screenshot mocking physicist Brian Cox's response to conspiracy theorists. Top text in large bold white outlined letters on light background: 'WHEN YOU CAN'T DEBATE THE GLOBE SO ALL YOU HAVE ARE INSULTS'. Main image shows young boy (approximately 7-10 years old) making exaggerated frustrated expression with eyes squeezed tightly shut, mouth open showing teeth in grimace of annoyance. Both hands raised with index fingers plugged into ears in classic 'I can't hear you' gesture - childish way of blocking out unwanted information. Child wears black t-shirt. White background suggests studio photograph or isolated image. Expression and pose convey refusal to listen, shutting out opposing viewpoints, immature response to disagreement. Lower portion shows Facebook post screenshot. Profile picture shows person wearing winter hat/beanie. Name reads 'Professor Brian Cox' with timestamp '9 hrs' and globe icon indicating public post. Post text reads: 'Amusing myself by blocking everyone who thinks either moon landings fake or Earth flat #futilegesturesthatneverthelessmakeushappy'. Hashtag references futile but satisfying actions. Right side shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution in black box. Meme criticizes Professor Brian Cox (British physicist, TV presenter, professor at University of Manchester, known for science communication programs like 'The Universe' and 'Human Universe') for blocking flat Earth believers and moon landing deniers rather than engaging in debate. Positions his blocking as childish refusal to discuss evidence, equivalent to child plugging ears. Implies Cox can't defend globe Earth through reasoned argument so resorts to blocking/insults. However, Cox likely blocked users not due to inability to debate, but because: 1) Professional scientists receive overwhelming volume of conspiracy theory comments making meaningful discussion impossible, 2) Most social media flat Earth debates involve bad-faith arguments, moving goalposts, rejection of evidence, 3) Cox has addressed these topics extensively in his programs and books with evidence, 4) Sometimes blocking is appropriate boundary-setting rather than admission of defeat. Cox is accomplished physicist who regularly explains evidence for spherical Earth, space exploration, physics of planetary formation. His decision to block persistent conspiracy theorists represents time management rather than inability to debate. Meme tries to position blocking as weakness when it may be reasonable response to unproductive repeated arguments. However, format resonates because condescending dismissal without engagement can feel unsatisfying to those genuinely questioning. Balance needed between patient education and boundary-setting with bad-faith actors4:Tbbf,Lake Powell red rock canyon perfect water reflection arguing water proves flat Earth. Stunning landscape photograph showing dramatic desert canyon scenery with mirror-like water reflection. Upper half displays towering red-orange sandstone rock formations - massive cliff faces and buttes characteristic of American Southwest (appears to be Lake Powell area, Arizona/Utah). Central formation shows prominent pyramidal peak with layered sedimentary rock strata visible in horizontal bands. Rocks display warm earth tones: deep red-orange, rust, burnt sienna in upper exposed portions transitioning to lighter tan, cream, white in lower sections showing different mineral compositions and weathering patterns. Vertical striations and erosion patterns create textured surfaces. Formations show millions of years of geological layering. Clear blue sky with scattered white clouds above - mix of puffy cumulus clouds creating pleasant partly-cloudy conditions. Upper left shows 'Flat Earth Matters' watermark in semi-transparent beige text. Lower half displays perfectly calm water surface acting as flawless mirror. Water reflects entire canyon scene with nearly perfect symmetry - rock formations, clouds, sky all duplicated upside-down in water. Reflection so clear that dividing line between reality and reflection almost invisible. Water appears absolutely still without ripples - glass-like surface creates pristine mirror effect. Rocks, clouds, even fine details perfectly replicated in reflection. Water shows deep blue color matching sky with brown tones near rock reflections. Scene demonstrates how calm water creates perfect reflections on locally flat surface. Bottom text on dark translucent overlay in large white sans-serif letters: 'The Natural Physics of Water Prove Earth Flat'. Classic flat Earth argument claiming water's tendency to find level surface and create mirror-like reflections proves Earth cannot be curved sphere. Argues that water always seeks level (horizontal) surface, cannot curve around ball. However, this photograph actually demonstrates local flatness on globally curved surface. Lake Powell reservoir has water surface area of ~250 square miles. At this scale, Earth's curvature is only ~130 feet across entire lake (calculated using radius 3,959 miles). This subtle curve completely imperceptible in photo. Water DOES curve following Earth's sphere - 'level' means perpendicular to gravity at each point, which creates curved surface globally while appearing flat locally. Perfect reflections occur because light reflects at consistent angles on calm water regardless of whether surface is part of sphere. Ships disappearing hull-first over horizon, inability to see across very large bodies of water, different water 'levels' (actually tangent points to sphere) at different locations all prove water does curve with Earth. Photograph shows local level, not global level. Similar to how small square cut from basketball appears flat despite basketball being spherical5:Tba8,Star trail long-exposure photograph showing circular patterns around celestial pole. Spectacular astrophotography image capturing hours of star movement through long-exposure time-lapse technique. Sky dominates frame showing hundreds of circular concentric star trails in vibrant colors - blue, cyan, teal, green, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple creating rainbow spectrum effect. Star trails form perfect circular arcs centered on point slightly left of center representing celestial pole (approximately where Polaris, North Star, is located). Each trail represents single star's apparent path across sky as Earth rotates. Trails range from tight circles near pole to wider arcs farther away. Colors indicate different star temperatures and atmospheric effects. Longer trails suggest hours-long exposure (likely 2-4+ hours). Center point shows slight gap where Polaris itself appears as small circle rather than point. Lower portion shows terrestrial landscape - silhouette of bare dead tree with branching limbs standing prominently against colorful sky on right side. Tree appears leafless with gnarled angular branches creating stark black profile. Left side shows silhouettes of smaller trees or bushes creating dark horizon line. Body of water (lake or river) visible as dark calm surface in foreground reflecting faint colors. Rocky or earthen shore visible in immediate foreground on right. Horizon shows gradient of warm colors - orange, yellow fading into darker blue-green above suggesting photograph captured from sunset through night into dawn, or twilight period. Lower left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' text in white sans-serif font. Lower right shows 'fb.com/fematters' attribution. Flat Earth community shares star trail photographs claiming circular motion around fixed point proves stars rotate above stationary flat Earth rather than Earth rotating beneath stars. However, star trails actually demonstrate Earth's rotation. From Northern Hemisphere, stars appear to circle Polaris because observer on rotating Earth sees celestial sphere appear to rotate in opposite direction. Polaris sits nearly aligned with Earth's rotational axis, so appears stationary while other stars trace circles around it. Southern Hemisphere observers see stars circle southern celestial pole (no bright pole star there). This phenomenon only makes sense on rotating sphere - if Earth were stationary disc with local rotating dome of stars, different mechanism would be required and observers at different locations would see different centers of rotation, which they don't. Star trail photography used by astronomers for centuries to demonstrate and measure Earth's rotation rate. Circular patterns prove spherical rotating Earth, not flat stationary plane. Foucault pendulum provides complementary evidence - pendulum's swing plane rotates due to Earth's rotation beneath it. Both phenomena demonstrate same physical reality: Earth rotates on axis once per ~23.93 hours (sidereal day)0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-324","title":"Other 324","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792190_471789219687484_3939437447536827211_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-323","title":"Other 323","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12792163_468785296654543_7026265244968193424_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-325","title":"Other 325","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12794964_473340079532398_4010653388263023867_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
