White text at top reads 'EASIEST FLAT EARTH PROOF' and large bottom text states 'WATAAAAH' in dramatic lettering. References Bruce Lee's famous philosophy 'Be like water' and his iconic vocal expression during martial arts demonstrations. Meme uses water as simplest proof of flat Earth: water naturally seeks and maintains level surface due to gravity, always finding lowest point and creating flat, horizontal surface when undisturbed. Argues this observable property of water (always level, never curved) proves Earth must be flat plane rather than sphere. Combines Bruce Lee's water philosophy with flat Earth argument that water's tendency to be level contradicts curved ocean surfaces required by spherical Earth model. Humorous format using martial arts legend to present water level as definitive flat Earth evidence"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-6","title":"Water Level 6","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962568_1473512486010947_2425436458586665699_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme about water curvature and scale. Top panel shows close-up photograph of small puddle in dirt/gravel with bird (appears to be crow or raven) standing in shallow water. Text reads 'A puddle of water doesn't begin to curve simply because it gets bigger.' Bottom panel shows aerial/satellite view of large body of water (lake or bay) with irregular blue-turquoise colored water surrounded by green land masses, urban development visible on shores. White lines drawn across water surface suggesting measurement or emphasis on flat appearance. Argues that water remains flat regardless of scale - small puddle or massive lake both display level surfaces without curvature. Questions why oceans should curve to fit spherical Earth if smaller bodies of water demonstrably don't curve. Presents scaling argument against water conforming to Earth's curvature: if puddles are flat, why should larger water bodies be any different"}}]
