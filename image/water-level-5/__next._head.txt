5:T4a2,Serene waterscape photograph with hashtag '#ProveWaterToBeConvex' at top. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene with wooden pier posts or pilings extending into perfectly calm water creating mirror reflections. Row of weathered wooden posts visible on left side of image stretching toward horizon. Water surface appears completely flat and smooth like glass, reflecting vibrant pink, orange, and blue cloudy sky. Sky displays mixture of dark storm clouds and bright areas near horizon where sun creates golden-peach glow. Perfectly level horizon line where water meets sky. Quote overlay in white text: '"The fact that water is flat like a sheet of paper (when undisturbed by wind and tide) is my 'working anchor,' and the powerful 'ground tackle' of all those who reject the delusions of modern theoretical astronomy. Prove water to be convex, and we will at once and forever retant and grant you anything you like to demand."' Attribution: '-Thomas Winship'. Quote challenges spherical Earth model by asserting water's observable flatness when calm contradicts curved surface required by globe model. Demands proof of water convexity as prerequisite for accepting heliocentric astronomy0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 5 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Serene waterscape photograph with hashtag '#ProveWaterToBeConvex' at top.
