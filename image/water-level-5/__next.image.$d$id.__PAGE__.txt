3:T4a2,Serene waterscape photograph with hashtag '#ProveWaterToBeConvex' at top. Shows dramatic sunset/sunrise scene with wooden pier posts or pilings extending into perfectly calm water creating mirror reflections. Row of weathered wooden posts visible on left side of image stretching toward horizon. Water surface appears completely flat and smooth like glass, reflecting vibrant pink, orange, and blue cloudy sky. Sky displays mixture of dark storm clouds and bright areas near horizon where sun creates golden-peach glow. Perfectly level horizon line where water meets sky. Quote overlay in white text: '"The fact that water is flat like a sheet of paper (when undisturbed by wind and tide) is my 'working anchor,' and the powerful 'ground tackle' of all those who reject the delusions of modern theoretical astronomy. Prove water to be convex, and we will at once and forever retant and grant you anything you like to demand."' Attribution: '-Thomas Winship'. Quote challenges spherical Earth model by asserting water's observable flatness when calm contradicts curved surface required by globe model. Demands proof of water convexity as prerequisite for accepting heliocentric astronomy0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-5","title":"Water Level 5","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14908300_1473512512677611_163419139376061412_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-4","title":"Water Level 4","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14906983_1473512396010956_8187552407344125710_n.jpeg","description":"Bruce Lee meme with black background featuring martial artist in iconic fighting stance with intense expression, shirtless showing muscular physique, hands extended in defensive/attack position. White text at top reads 'EASIEST FLAT EARTH PROOF' and large bottom text states 'WATAAAAH' in dramatic lettering. References Bruce Lee's famous philosophy 'Be like water' and his iconic vocal expression during martial arts demonstrations. Meme uses water as simplest proof of flat Earth: water naturally seeks and maintains level surface due to gravity, always finding lowest point and creating flat, horizontal surface when undisturbed. Argues this observable property of water (always level, never curved) proves Earth must be flat plane rather than sphere. Combines Bruce Lee's water philosophy with flat Earth argument that water's tendency to be level contradicts curved ocean surfaces required by spherical Earth model. Humorous format using martial arts legend to present water level as definitive flat Earth evidence"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-6","title":"Water Level 6","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/14962568_1473512486010947_2425436458586665699_n.jpeg","description":"Two-panel comparison meme about water curvature and scale. Top panel shows close-up photograph of small puddle in dirt/gravel with bird (appears to be crow or raven) standing in shallow water. Text reads 'A puddle of water doesn't begin to curve simply because it gets bigger.' Bottom panel shows aerial/satellite view of large body of water (lake or bay) with irregular blue-turquoise colored water surrounded by green land masses, urban development visible on shores. White lines drawn across water surface suggesting measurement or emphasis on flat appearance. Argues that water remains flat regardless of scale - small puddle or massive lake both display level surfaces without curvature. Questions why oceans should curve to fit spherical Earth if smaller bodies of water demonstrably don't curve. Presents scaling argument against water conforming to Earth's curvature: if puddles are flat, why should larger water bodies be any different"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
