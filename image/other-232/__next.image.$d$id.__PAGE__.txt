3:T59f,Dramatic ocean sunset with crepuscular rays and Leonardo da Vinci perception quote. Shows stunning natural seascape photograph at sunset or sunrise. Sky dominates upper two-thirds with dramatic cloud formations - thick gray-purple storm clouds mixed with golden-orange illuminated clouds. Sun breaking through clouds creates spectacular crepuscular rays (sun rays/god rays) - multiple distinct beams of light radiating downward and outward from cloud gap, appearing to converge at single point above horizon. Rays show various angles spreading across sky like fan. Light creates golden-orange glow on water surface where rays strike ocean. Lower portion shows dark silhouetted ocean water in deep blue-black with golden reflection path from sun. Very bottom edge shows black silhouettes of land, vegetation, or trees. Top text in white reads: 'There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown, those who do not see.' Attribution below: '- Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Crepuscular rays used as evidence for local close sun rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Flat Earth argument claims if sun were truly distant, rays should be parallel not convergent. Perspective effect causes parallel rays to appear to converge at vanishing point, same as railroad tracks. Quote implies flat Earthers are 'those who see' truth directly through observation4:T5b1,Challenger crew comparison photo suggesting survivors. Shows official 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger STS-51-L crew photograph in black and white. Seven astronauts in NASA flight suits pose in two rows - four standing in back row, three kneeling in front holding helmets. American flag with stars visible upper left. Crew members wear blue NASA jumpsuits with mission patches, name tags. Shuttle model visible bottom left. Image overlaid with circular insets showing color photographs of faces - several crew members have white-bordered circular photos superimposed showing older individuals allegedly identified as same people decades later. Top text reads: 'The "Challenger crew"- 30 years on?' One circle contains only question mark suggesting missing person. Conspiracy theory claims Challenger crew members survived 1986 explosion and are living under different identities. Proponents point to people with similar names and appearances working in academia and other fields. Arguments cite lack of visible aging in some cases, similar facial features, matching names. However, investigation shows these are different people with coincidentally similar names. Theory suggests Challenger disaster was staged false flag event. Mainstream history confirms all seven crew members perished when external tank exploded 73 seconds after launch on January 28, 1986. Debris and remains were recovered. Families held funerals. Theory disrespects victims and families5:T5b9,NASA astronaut requirements satirical checklist with spacewalk background. Shows astronaut in white EVA spacesuit performing spacewalk in low Earth orbit. Astronaut's helmet reflects bright sunlight, shows gold-tinted visor, white PLSS (Portable Life Support System) backpack visible. Background shows stunning Earth view from space - curved blue planet with white cloud swirls, turquoise-blue oceans visible. Atmosphere limb glows bright blue at horizon. Dark space visible at top. Upper right shows official NASA logo (blue circle with red chevron, white letters). Foreground displays satirical document titled 'NASA Astronaut Requirements' with three items checked with blue checkmarks: 'Bachelor's degree in a Scuba diving', '33rd degree Freemason', 'Ability to lie'. Upper left shows 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' in white text. Bottom right displays 'JM' signature watermark. Satire suggests NASA astronauts are selected for conspiracy participation rather than scientific credentials. Bachelor's degree in scuba diving mocks underwater training in Neutral Buoyancy Lab where astronauts practice EVA procedures - conspiracy theorists claim spacewalk footage is filmed underwater. 33rd degree Freemason reference suggests occult secret society controls space program. Multiple astronauts have been Freemasons including Buzz Aldrin. 'Ability to lie' explicitly states astronauts are actors perpetuating hoax. Discredits astronaut testimony and space program achievements0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-232","title":"Other 232","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662673_466884456844627_7673106619158676577_n.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-231","title":"Other 231","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12662663_458878110978595_3003324589013974460_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-233","title":"Other 233","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12669451_460535570812849_7178703130652227552_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
