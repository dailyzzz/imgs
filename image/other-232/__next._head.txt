5:T59f,Dramatic ocean sunset with crepuscular rays and Leonardo da Vinci perception quote. Shows stunning natural seascape photograph at sunset or sunrise. Sky dominates upper two-thirds with dramatic cloud formations - thick gray-purple storm clouds mixed with golden-orange illuminated clouds. Sun breaking through clouds creates spectacular crepuscular rays (sun rays/god rays) - multiple distinct beams of light radiating downward and outward from cloud gap, appearing to converge at single point above horizon. Rays show various angles spreading across sky like fan. Light creates golden-orange glow on water surface where rays strike ocean. Lower portion shows dark silhouetted ocean water in deep blue-black with golden reflection path from sun. Very bottom edge shows black silhouettes of land, vegetation, or trees. Top text in white reads: 'There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown, those who do not see.' Attribution below: '- Leonardo da Vinci'. Bottom right corner displays 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS' watermark. Crepuscular rays used as evidence for local close sun rather than distant sun 93 million miles away. Flat Earth argument claims if sun were truly distant, rays should be parallel not convergent. Perspective effect causes parallel rays to appear to converge at vanishing point, same as railroad tracks. Quote implies flat Earthers are 'those who see' truth directly through observation0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 232 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Dramatic ocean sunset with crepuscular rays and Leonardo da Vinci perception quote.
