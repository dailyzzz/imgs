5:T20ca,Gleason's azimuthal equidistant map encouraging flat Earth research over formal education. Historical flat Earth map with motivational text suggesting independent research reveals truth mainstream education hides. Background shows Gleason's New Standard Map of the World from 1892 - most famous flat Earth map showing azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole. Map is circular showing continents arranged radially around central point (North Pole marked with small black dot at center). Landmasses include North America in upper left showing United States, Canada, and Mexico in tan/beige color; South America below in yellow-tan; Europe in upper center showing British Isles, France, Spain, and Eastern Europe; Africa extending down from Europe in green-yellow tones; Asia spanning right side showing Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia in various colors (green, yellow, tan); Australia in lower right in yellow. Antarctica not shown as continent but rather forms outer ice ring around perimeter containing all oceans - represented by white/cream colored band at map's edge with "SOUTH" labels. Oceans shown in light blue-teal color filling spaces between continents. Map includes grid system - concentric circles radiating from center representing latitude lines (increasing distance from North Pole), and radial lines emanating from center like spoke representing longitude lines. Grid creates web-like pattern across entire circular map. Curved lines across map show navigation routes, shipping lanes, or distance measurements characteristic of azimuthal equidistant projection where distances from center point are accurate but distortions increase toward edges. Text labels scattered across map show geographic names, though most too small to read at this resolution. Map's edges fade into coral-pink or salmon-colored border/background creating frame. Decorative corner elements visible in coral areas showing compass roses or ornamental designs. Historical map shows aged appearance - slightly yellowed/cream colored land areas, faded blue oceans, antique cartographic style from late 19th century. Upper left corner shows partial text possibly indicating map title or publisher (likely "GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD"). Map represents Gleason's 1892 patent (#497,917) - most reproduced flat Earth map in modern movement. Text overlays span top and bottom of image in large bold white letters with thick black outline for maximum contrast and readability. Top text: "YOU DON'T NEED A BIG DEGREE," suggesting formal education (university degree) is unnecessary for understanding Earth's true shape. Bottom text: "JUST RESEARCH" encouraging independent investigation over accepting mainstream academic consensus. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in black text. Message positions flat Earth as accessible truth discoverable through personal research rather than requiring specialized education. Implies: 1) University education indoctrinates students into false globe Earth model rather than teaching critical thinking, 2) Truth about Earth's shape is hidden by academic gatekeepers who require expensive degrees as barrier to knowledge, 3) Independent researchers using internet, YouTube videos, and alternative sources can discover truth mainstream science conceals, 4) "Do your own research" ethos common in conspiracy communities - suggests investigation means watching conspiracy content rather than studying actual evidence, conducting experiments, or learning scientific methodology. Gleason's map is azimuthal equidistant projection - legitimate map projection used for specific purposes (aviation routes from central point, radio communications showing coverage areas) but not representation of Earth's actual shape. Projection shows accurate distances and directions FROM center point, but distorts shapes and distances between points away from center. Antarctica appears massively oversized as continuous ice wall rather than continent because projection stretches Southern Hemisphere around entire circumference. If Antarctica were truly ice wall as shown (60,000+ mile circumference based on map), it would be larger than all other continents combined - contradicts actual measurements showing Antarctica is roughly 5.5 million square miles (14 million km²), smaller than Asia or Africa. Map's utility for navigation doesn't prove Earth is flat - it's mathematical projection of spherical surface onto plane, like Mercator projection or globe Earth projections. Cartographers use many projections, each distorting some properties (area, shape, distance, direction) to preserve others. No flat map perfectly represents spherical surface. "Just research" suggestion contains irony: Actual research (conducting experiments, reviewing peer-reviewed literature, replicating observations) consistently confirms spherical Earth. What flat Earth movement calls "research" typically means watching YouTube conspiracy videos, reading flat Earth websites, and finding ways to dismiss contrary evidence. Real research would include: measuring stick shadows at different latitudes (Eratosthenes experiment proving sphericity in 240 BCE), observing ships disappear hull-first over horizon with telescope, tracking satellite positions matching orbital predictions for spherical planet, photographing horizon from high altitude showing curvature, observing different star constellations from different hemispheres (Southern Cross visible in Southern Hemisphere, not visible from Northern Hemisphere). "Big degree" dismissal reflects anti-intellectualism in conspiracy communities - framing scientific education as brainwashing rather than skill development. However, understanding Earth's shape doesn't require degree - ancient Greeks determined sphericity using simple geometry and observations. Modern evidence accessible to anyone: time zones (sun overhead in different locations at different times impossible on flat plane with sun as local spotlight), seasons (caused by axial tilt of sphere, unexplainable on flat plane), circumnavigation (traveling continuously east or west returns to starting point), GPS systems working via satellites in orbit around sphere. Gleason's map itself contains contradictions with flat Earth model: Shows accurate distances from North Pole center, but this means distances around outer edges (Southern Hemisphere) are vastly inflated. Flight from Australia to South America would be much longer on flat map than reality (flights take ~13 hours direct, consistent with globe but would require ~30+ hours on flat map). Sun and moon positions, rise/set times don't work on flat plane with local sun circling above disc - would be visible from all locations simultaneously. Map's survival in flat Earth communities despite being 130+ years old reflects movement's reliance on historical curiosities rather than modern evidence. Contemporary flat Earthers point to Gleason's map as "proof" authorities recognize flat Earth (it has UN logo similarity), ignoring that azimuthal equidistant projection is standard cartographic tool used alongside many other projections by same cartographers who know Earth is spherical. Meme's effectiveness comes from appealing message: You don't need expensive education or expert credentials to understand truth. Just use common sense and personal investigation. This message resonates with those who feel excluded from academic institutions or skeptical of credentialed experts. However, conflates "accessible truth" with "easy answers that confirm existing beliefs." Real scientific understanding requires learning methodology, understanding scale, recognizing cognitive biases, distinguishing between evidence and assumption. Background image chosen for aesthetic appeal - vintage map has artistic beauty, intricate details, historical gravitas lending authority to message. Pink border creates warm inviting feel making propaganda more palatable than harsh text-only format. Strategy positions flat Earth as people's movement accessible to common person versus elitist academic gatekeeping. However, science is actually most democratic knowledge system - anyone can verify claims through experiments and observations, not requiring faith in authorities. Meme inverts reality: mainstream science encourages investigation, flat Earth movement discourages questioning once converted.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 365 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Gleason's azimuthal equidistant map encouraging flat Earth research over formal education.
