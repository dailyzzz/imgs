3:T20ca,Gleason's azimuthal equidistant map encouraging flat Earth research over formal education. Historical flat Earth map with motivational text suggesting independent research reveals truth mainstream education hides. Background shows Gleason's New Standard Map of the World from 1892 - most famous flat Earth map showing azimuthal equidistant projection centered on North Pole. Map is circular showing continents arranged radially around central point (North Pole marked with small black dot at center). Landmasses include North America in upper left showing United States, Canada, and Mexico in tan/beige color; South America below in yellow-tan; Europe in upper center showing British Isles, France, Spain, and Eastern Europe; Africa extending down from Europe in green-yellow tones; Asia spanning right side showing Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia in various colors (green, yellow, tan); Australia in lower right in yellow. Antarctica not shown as continent but rather forms outer ice ring around perimeter containing all oceans - represented by white/cream colored band at map's edge with "SOUTH" labels. Oceans shown in light blue-teal color filling spaces between continents. Map includes grid system - concentric circles radiating from center representing latitude lines (increasing distance from North Pole), and radial lines emanating from center like spoke representing longitude lines. Grid creates web-like pattern across entire circular map. Curved lines across map show navigation routes, shipping lanes, or distance measurements characteristic of azimuthal equidistant projection where distances from center point are accurate but distortions increase toward edges. Text labels scattered across map show geographic names, though most too small to read at this resolution. Map's edges fade into coral-pink or salmon-colored border/background creating frame. Decorative corner elements visible in coral areas showing compass roses or ornamental designs. Historical map shows aged appearance - slightly yellowed/cream colored land areas, faded blue oceans, antique cartographic style from late 19th century. Upper left corner shows partial text possibly indicating map title or publisher (likely "GLEASON'S NEW STANDARD MAP OF THE WORLD"). Map represents Gleason's 1892 patent (#497,917) - most reproduced flat Earth map in modern movement. Text overlays span top and bottom of image in large bold white letters with thick black outline for maximum contrast and readability. Top text: "YOU DON'T NEED A BIG DEGREE," suggesting formal education (university degree) is unnecessary for understanding Earth's true shape. Bottom text: "JUST RESEARCH" encouraging independent investigation over accepting mainstream academic consensus. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in black text. Message positions flat Earth as accessible truth discoverable through personal research rather than requiring specialized education. Implies: 1) University education indoctrinates students into false globe Earth model rather than teaching critical thinking, 2) Truth about Earth's shape is hidden by academic gatekeepers who require expensive degrees as barrier to knowledge, 3) Independent researchers using internet, YouTube videos, and alternative sources can discover truth mainstream science conceals, 4) "Do your own research" ethos common in conspiracy communities - suggests investigation means watching conspiracy content rather than studying actual evidence, conducting experiments, or learning scientific methodology. Gleason's map is azimuthal equidistant projection - legitimate map projection used for specific purposes (aviation routes from central point, radio communications showing coverage areas) but not representation of Earth's actual shape. Projection shows accurate distances and directions FROM center point, but distorts shapes and distances between points away from center. Antarctica appears massively oversized as continuous ice wall rather than continent because projection stretches Southern Hemisphere around entire circumference. If Antarctica were truly ice wall as shown (60,000+ mile circumference based on map), it would be larger than all other continents combined - contradicts actual measurements showing Antarctica is roughly 5.5 million square miles (14 million km²), smaller than Asia or Africa. Map's utility for navigation doesn't prove Earth is flat - it's mathematical projection of spherical surface onto plane, like Mercator projection or globe Earth projections. Cartographers use many projections, each distorting some properties (area, shape, distance, direction) to preserve others. No flat map perfectly represents spherical surface. "Just research" suggestion contains irony: Actual research (conducting experiments, reviewing peer-reviewed literature, replicating observations) consistently confirms spherical Earth. What flat Earth movement calls "research" typically means watching YouTube conspiracy videos, reading flat Earth websites, and finding ways to dismiss contrary evidence. Real research would include: measuring stick shadows at different latitudes (Eratosthenes experiment proving sphericity in 240 BCE), observing ships disappear hull-first over horizon with telescope, tracking satellite positions matching orbital predictions for spherical planet, photographing horizon from high altitude showing curvature, observing different star constellations from different hemispheres (Southern Cross visible in Southern Hemisphere, not visible from Northern Hemisphere). "Big degree" dismissal reflects anti-intellectualism in conspiracy communities - framing scientific education as brainwashing rather than skill development. However, understanding Earth's shape doesn't require degree - ancient Greeks determined sphericity using simple geometry and observations. Modern evidence accessible to anyone: time zones (sun overhead in different locations at different times impossible on flat plane with sun as local spotlight), seasons (caused by axial tilt of sphere, unexplainable on flat plane), circumnavigation (traveling continuously east or west returns to starting point), GPS systems working via satellites in orbit around sphere. Gleason's map itself contains contradictions with flat Earth model: Shows accurate distances from North Pole center, but this means distances around outer edges (Southern Hemisphere) are vastly inflated. Flight from Australia to South America would be much longer on flat map than reality (flights take ~13 hours direct, consistent with globe but would require ~30+ hours on flat map). Sun and moon positions, rise/set times don't work on flat plane with local sun circling above disc - would be visible from all locations simultaneously. Map's survival in flat Earth communities despite being 130+ years old reflects movement's reliance on historical curiosities rather than modern evidence. Contemporary flat Earthers point to Gleason's map as "proof" authorities recognize flat Earth (it has UN logo similarity), ignoring that azimuthal equidistant projection is standard cartographic tool used alongside many other projections by same cartographers who know Earth is spherical. Meme's effectiveness comes from appealing message: You don't need expensive education or expert credentials to understand truth. Just use common sense and personal investigation. This message resonates with those who feel excluded from academic institutions or skeptical of credentialed experts. However, conflates "accessible truth" with "easy answers that confirm existing beliefs." Real scientific understanding requires learning methodology, understanding scale, recognizing cognitive biases, distinguishing between evidence and assumption. Background image chosen for aesthetic appeal - vintage map has artistic beauty, intricate details, historical gravitas lending authority to message. Pink border creates warm inviting feel making propaganda more palatable than harsh text-only format. Strategy positions flat Earth as people's movement accessible to common person versus elitist academic gatekeeping. However, science is actually most democratic knowledge system - anyone can verify claims through experiments and observations, not requiring faith in authorities. Meme inverts reality: mainstream science encourages investigation, flat Earth movement discourages questioning once converted.4:T1b83,Ice Cube meme about anger at flat Earth truth versus ignoring those who lied about globe Earth. Popular meme format using rapper/actor Ice Cube's confrontational expression to comment on social response to flat Earth beliefs. Image shows Ice Cube during interview or talk show appearance, seated in chair with studio set background. Ice Cube wears olive green or military green collared shirt/jacket with visible collar and black undershirt, microphone visible clipped to clothing suggesting interview setting. His facial expression shows intense frustration, anger, or exasperation - eyebrows furrowed deeply creating prominent wrinkles between eyes, eyes narrowed, mouth open mid-speech showing teeth, overall expression of being fed up or confrontational. Face angled toward camera showing three-quarter view. Background shows out-of-focus interior setting - appears to be television studio or interview set with blue-tinted lighting visible on right side creating glow, possibly window or screen, brown/gray tones suggesting furniture or set pieces. Left side shows darker background suggesting depth of set. Professional lighting creates highlights on Ice Cube's face while shadows emphasize expression. Text overlays in large bold white letters with black outline creating high contrast for readability. Top text spans upper portion in two lines: "PEOPLE BE GETTIN' MAD AT YOU FOR SPREADING TRUTH ABOUT FLAT EARTH" - captures flat Earth believers' frustration at negative social response to sharing beliefs. Uses casual vernacular ("gettin' mad," "be") matching Ice Cube's speaking style and creating relatable conversational tone. Bottom text spans lower portion in two lines: "BUT DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ONES THAT LIED & TOLD THEM IT WAS A BALL" - contrasts anger at flat Earth believers with lack of anger toward establishment (educators, scientists, governments, NASA) who taught globe Earth, framing them as liars who deceived humanity. Word "BALL" emphasizes spherical Earth in dismissive casual language rather than scientific "sphere" or "globe." Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme format uses Ice Cube's angry expression to channel flat Earth believers' frustration at perceived double standard in social reaction. Argument has several components: 1) PERSECUTION COMPLEX: Flat Earth believers often report negative social consequences from sharing beliefs - ridicule, ostracism, arguments with family/friends, being labeled conspiracy theorist or scientifically illiterate. Meme validates this experience, positioning flat Earther as victim of irrational anger from others who can't handle truth. 2) FALSE EQUIVALENCE: Sets up comparison suggesting equivalent offenses - spreading "flat Earth truth" versus lying about "ball Earth." Implies both claims are just competing narratives of equal validity, differing only in establishment endorsement. However, claims are not equivalent: globe Earth supported by overwhelming evidence (ships over horizon, different stars at different latitudes, time zones, seasons, satellite imagery, circumnavigation, physics), while flat Earth contradicts observations and requires extensive conspiracy theory to explain away contrary evidence. 3) ACCUSATION OF LYING: Frames everyone who taught spherical Earth (teachers, scientists, government, NASA, media) as conscious liars rather than people sharing well-established scientific knowledge. Suggests malicious deception rather than education based on evidence. Ignores possibility that mainstream view is correct and evidence-based. 4) DOUBLE STANDARD CLAIM: Argues people get angry at flat Earthers for challenging mainstream view but don't get angry at establishment for allegedly lying about Earth's shape. Suggests hypocrisy or cognitive dissonance in critics. However, this misses actual reason for reactions: people get frustrated with flat Earth claims because they contradict easily verifiable observations and require rejecting vast amounts of established science. Anger isn't at "spreading different truth" but at promoting demonstrably false claims while dismissing evidence. People don't get angry at scientists/teachers because they're sharing accurate information confirmed by observations anyone can make. 5) TRUTH FRAMING: Uses word "truth" to describe flat Earth belief, assuming conclusion rather than arguing for it. Positions flat Earth as established fact being revealed rather than claim requiring evidence. Rhetorical strategy: if it's "truth," then negative reactions are unjust persecution rather than rational disagreement with false claim. Ice Cube's expression perfectly captures persecution mentality - intense frustration at being judged harshly while alleged wrongdoers (mainstream educators) face no consequences. Image resonates with flat Earth believers who feel misunderstood, attacked, or dismissed. However, social response to flat Earth claims mirrors social response to other factually incorrect claims - skepticism, frustration, attempts to educate, eventually dismissal if person persists despite evidence. Not unique persecution but normal reaction to rejecting well-established facts. Meme format (celebrity reaction image with overlaid text) is popular internet template. Ice Cube's confrontational expression used for many "rant" or "calling out hypocrisy" memes. His tough persona and no-nonsense reputation make him effective avatar for expressing frustration. Irony: Ice Cube himself has not publicly endorsed flat Earth (as of knowledge cutoff), so image appropriates his likeness for flat Earth messaging. Many celebrities featured in flat Earth memes haven't actually expressed such views - their images used because expressions fit narrative. "They lied & told them it was a ball" phrasing suggests childhood indoctrination - taught in school Earth is sphere, accepted without question, now discovering "truth" as adults that it was lie. Flat Earth movement often frames belief as awakening or red pill experience, discovering what "they" don't want you to know. Reality: Earth's sphericity taught in schools because it's observable fact confirmed by evidence, not dogma requiring faith. Students can verify claims through experiments (Eratosthenes stick shadow experiment measuring circumference using geometry, observing ships over horizon, tracking satellite positions). Education provides tools for understanding, not just assertions requiring blind acceptance. Meme's effectiveness in flat Earth communities comes from validation of shared experience - others feel same frustration at social rejection of their beliefs, same sense that they're being unfairly targeted while establishment gets away with "lies." Creates solidarity and reinforces group identity as persecuted truth-seekers against hostile masses who prefer comfortable lies. Psychological appeal: positions believer as brave, independent thinker willing to face social costs for truth, while critics are either gullible sheep believing lies or angry thought-police attacking free thinkers.5:T1f24,"The Martian" movie astronaut meme claiming NASA and Hollywood condition public to accept fake Mars missions. Image uses still from 2015 science fiction film "The Martian" to suggest collaboration between entertainment industry and space agency to manufacture false Mars mission narrative. Photograph shows actor Matt Damon in character as Mark Watney, astronaut stranded on Mars in film. Damon wears detailed futuristic spacesuit - appears to be EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suit designed for Martian environment. Suit shows realistic construction with multiple components: Hard Upper Torso (HUT) unit in off-white/gray color with various panels, ports, connectors visible; bright orange shoulder/upper arm sections creating striking color contrast with main suit body; detailed mechanical joints at shoulders showing fabric accordion sections allowing arm movement; multiple equipment pouches, attachment points, and technical details across chest suggesting life support systems, communications equipment; torso shows metallic rectangular panel with circular ports, pressure gauges, controls suggesting chest-mounted display unit; fabric sections in brown/tan tones with mesh or perforated areas for ventilation/flexibility. Helmet is large transparent polycarbonate sphere allowing full visibility - classic space helmet design with metal neck ring attachment to suit. Helmet shows slight dirt/dust accumulation suggesting use on Mars surface. Inside helmet, Damon's face clearly visible - serious, contemplative expression looking slightly downward, facial hair visible (beard/stubble grown during isolation on Mars in film's plot), lighting shows face details despite helmet. Helmet's transparency allows viewer to see actor's eyes and expression creating human connection despite technical equipment. Background shows neutral gray gradient suggesting studio photography setup with professional lighting - not actual Mars landscape or space, but promotional photograph for film. Lighting creates subtle shadows and highlights on suit emphasizing three-dimensional details and material textures. Image quality high suggesting official promotional material or press kit photo. Text overlays span top and bottom in large bold white letters with black outline for maximum readability and contrast. Top text in two lines: "NASA AND HOLLYWOOD ARE CONDITIONING YOU" suggesting coordinated propaganda campaign by space agency and entertainment industry. Middle text implied by context. Bottom text in two lines: "TO ACCEPT THE FAKE MISSION TO MARS" completing message that Mars missions are hoaxes being normalized through entertainment. Lower left shows "fb.com/fematters" attribution in white text. Meme's argument embodies several conspiracy theories: 1) ENTERTAINMENT AS PROPAGANDA: Claims Hollywood creates films showing Mars missions/space exploration to condition public into accepting NASA's false claims as normal and achievable. Theory suggests entertainment industry and government space agencies collaborate to manufacture false reality. "The Martian" (2015), "Interstellar" (2014), "Gravity" (2013), and similar films supposedly prepare public psychologically to believe Mars missions are real when announced. 2) "CONDITIONING" TERMINOLOGY: Uses psychological term suggesting manipulation - Pavlovian conditioning where repeated exposure creates acceptance of false narratives. Implies viewers being programmed rather than entertained, unable to distinguish fiction from documentary. 3) MARS MISSION SKEPTICISM: Suggests all Mars missions (rovers, orbiters, planned human missions) are elaborate hoaxes filmed on Earth. Theory claims Mars footage comes from remote locations (Devon Island, Canada frequently cited) with red filters and CGI backgrounds. 4) NASA-HOLLYWOOD CONNECTION: Points to actual connections between aerospace and entertainment industries as evidence of conspiracy. NASA does collaborate with filmmakers as consultants for accuracy (Interstellar consulted physicist Kip Thorne, "The Martian" consulted NASA for realistic details), but this is technical advising for entertainment, not propaganda coordination. However, extensive evidence confirms Mars missions are real: Multiple nations operate Mars missions (USA, Russia, ESA, India, China, UAE) - geopolitical competitors wouldn't collaborate on hoax. Rovers send continuous data streams trackable by amateur radio operators worldwide. Mars surface photos show consistent geology, atmospheric conditions, seasonal changes over years. Rover tracks visible in images showing movement over time - impossible to maintain in Earth filming. Chinese Zhurong rover photographed NASA's rovers on Mars surface from orbit. Orbital mechanics require precise calculations for launch windows (Earth-Mars trajectories possible only at specific times due to orbital positions), observable by amateur astronomers tracking spacecraft. Scientific data from Mars includes atmospheric composition (95% CO2), mineralogy unique to Mars, discovery of water ice, seasonal methane variations - consistent discoveries from multiple independent missions over decades. "The Martian" specifically consulted NASA extensively for realism - author Andy Weir researched actual Mars mission plans, orbital mechanics, spacecraft technology. Film depicts challenges NASA would actually face in Mars mission including: dust storms (though film exaggerated their strength for drama), food production in habitat, travel time to/from Mars (~9 months each way with current technology), communication delays (4-24 minutes one way depending on positions). Film's accuracy makes it educational, not propaganda. Irony of using "The Martian" for this meme: Film is labeled science fiction, audiences know it's not documentary. No conditioning occurs because fiction explicitly presented as fiction. Same audiences who enjoy Marvel superhero films don't believe humans can actually fly or shoot lasers from eyes. Fiction/reality distinction is clear. Entertainment can inspire interest in space exploration (Star Trek inspired many scientists/engineers) without creating false beliefs about current capabilities. Conspiracy theory suggests public is gullible, easily confused between fiction and reality - insulting presumption. However, flat Earth movement itself sometimes struggles with this distinction, citing science fiction films as evidence of how space "really works" or pointing to film production techniques as proof space footage is faked. Meme's visual effectiveness comes from choosing realistic-looking spacesuit from big-budget film. Detailed costume design makes it appear authentic (because filmmakers wanted believability), allowing conspiracy interpretation as "this is what fake Mars suit looks like." But film production required detailed realistic costume precisely because audiences expect scientific accuracy in "hard sci-fi" genre. Spacesuit in image is designed for Martian conditions (lower atmospheric pressure than Earth but higher than vacuum of space, dust protection, temperature extremes), different from real NASA Z-2 prototype Mars suit or SpaceX suits, but based on real engineering constraints. "Conditioning" accusation reflects deeper distrust of media, government, science - assumption that all narratives are manufactured rather than some being accurate reporting and others being labeled fiction. Worldview where everything potentially false makes it impossible to verify anything, leading to rejection of consensus reality in favor of conspiracy alternatives that feel more "true" despite contradicting evidence. Alternative reading: If NASA and Hollywood were coordinating propaganda, why would they make films showing deadly disasters (Apollo 13, Gravity, "The Martian" showing life-threatening situations)? Propaganda would show only successful, safe missions. But entertainment thrives on conflict and danger, showing that artistic rather than propaganda motivations drive storytelling.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-365","title":"Other 365","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12841259_473720389494367_7493218766743515803_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-364","title":"Other 364","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12832304_473689162830823_8188051213742663614_n.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-366","title":"Other 366","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12841318_472497339616672_4231511836749048601_o.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
