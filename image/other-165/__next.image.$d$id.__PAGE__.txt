3:T465,Humorous upside-down Google Maps car reflection photo. Shows white Google Street View mapping vehicle with distinctive roof-mounted camera rig, multicolored Google Maps livery (green text reading 'Google Maps' visible on side), and black wheels. Vehicle appears upside-down as photographed in water reflection/puddle on asphalt road surface. Gray pavement visible at top (actually ground). Reflection shows perfect mirror image with brown/tan dried grass or field visible in background of reflection. Top text in bold white letters: 'GOOGLE MAPS'. Bottom text in large white letters: 'AUSTRALIA'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Satirical meme mocking globe Earth model's implication that Australia (southern hemisphere) is upside-down relative to northern hemisphere. Plays on common flat Earth joke about Australians living upside-down on bottom of spinning ball. Uses clever visual of reflected vehicle to represent how absurd it would be for people to actually live inverted. Suggests flat Earth model makes more sense because all people stand upright on same plane rather than at various angles around sphere4:T4d1,Walking Dead four-panel meme featuring Rick and Carl Grimes discussing flat Earth proof. Shows beige brick wall background with 'C BLOCK' text visible. Four vertical panels show conversation between father Rick (right, wearing blood-spattered beige/tan shirt, dark beard, disheveled appearance) and son Carl (left, wearing brown shirt and sheriff's hat). Panel 1: 'SO I HEARD YOUR FRIENDS THINK THE EARTH IS FLAT CARL?'. Panel 2: 'BUT DAD, WHAT PROOF DO WE HAVE IT'S A GLOBE?'. Panel 3: 'BECAUSE NASA TOOK A PICTURE.'. Panel 4: 'A PICTURE, CARL.' with Rick giving Carl disappointed/exasperated look. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Bottom right 'JM' logo. Uses popular Rick and Carl meme format (usually about bad jokes/puns) to mock insufficient evidence for globe Earth. Satirizes appeal to authority by reducing all proof to single NASA photograph. Rick's condescending tone suggests accepting globe based solely on NASA images is naive or insufficient. Highlights flat Earth argument that photographic evidence can be manipulated and shouldn't be blindly trusted. Carl's innocent question represents those questioning mainstream narrative, while Rick represents those who accept authority without critical examination5:T4a5,Satirical Pear Earth Society logo parody. White background with black serif text at top: 'THE PEAR EARTH SOCIETY' and 'thepearearthsociety.org' website. Center shows circular emblem with black outline. Inside circle sits pear-shaped Earth illustration - irregular lumpy blue-green globe with continents visible including orange Australia, resembling actual pear fruit shape with stem at top (North Pole area). Blue represents oceans, green/gray shows landmasses. Bottom banner ribbon across circle displays Latin motto 'IN VERITATE VICTORIA' (In Truth Victory). Bottom right watermark 'Flat Earth Matters' in light gray. Parodies Flat Earth Society by proposing equally absurd alternative Earth shape. References Neil deGrasse Tyson's statement that Earth is slightly oblate spheroid (pear-shaped due to equatorial bulge), which flat Earth proponents mock as excuse for why Earth doesn't look perfectly spherical in photos. Satirizes how mainstream science keeps modifying Earth's shape description (perfect sphere → oblate spheroid → pear-shaped) to explain photographic inconsistencies. Uses humor to suggest if scientists can claim Earth is pear-shaped, flat Earth is no more absurd0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"other-165","title":"Other 165","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12493861_454243174775422_2440540554143726316_o.jpg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"other-164","title":"Other 164","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12491892_456960284503711_5763607894917993478_o.jpg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-166","title":"Other 166","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/12495251_468500190016387_8278333110528552931_n.jpg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
