5:T465,Humorous upside-down Google Maps car reflection photo. Shows white Google Street View mapping vehicle with distinctive roof-mounted camera rig, multicolored Google Maps livery (green text reading 'Google Maps' visible on side), and black wheels. Vehicle appears upside-down as photographed in water reflection/puddle on asphalt road surface. Gray pavement visible at top (actually ground). Reflection shows perfect mirror image with brown/tan dried grass or field visible in background of reflection. Top text in bold white letters: 'GOOGLE MAPS'. Bottom text in large white letters: 'AUSTRALIA'. Bottom left watermark 'FLAT EARTH MATTERS'. Satirical meme mocking globe Earth model's implication that Australia (southern hemisphere) is upside-down relative to northern hemisphere. Plays on common flat Earth joke about Australians living upside-down on bottom of spinning ball. Uses clever visual of reflected vehicle to represent how absurd it would be for people to actually live inverted. Suggests flat Earth model makes more sense because all people stand upright on same plane rather than at various angles around sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Other 165 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Humorous upside-down Google Maps car reflection photo.
