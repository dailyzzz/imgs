Top row labeled 'Watch the Sun.' shows three photographs of sun progressively descending toward horizon over landscape, maintaining relatively consistent apparent size. Bottom row labeled 'Think about the Sun.' shows three photographs where sun appears noticeably smaller and dimmer as it approaches horizon, with final panel showing sun as small orange dot. Sequence demonstrates phenomenon where setting sun appears to shrink in angular size, which is used to argue sun is moving away from observer rather than Earth rotating. Presents atmospheric refraction, perspective effects, and increased atmospheric scattering at low angles as evidence for local, nearby sun moving away horizontally rather than distant sun being obscured by Earth's curvature due to rotation"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-11","title":"The Sun 11","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/20258399_1416599365044078_5035741180096448309_n.jpeg","description":"Meme titled 'CONSISTENCY' with emoji decorations showing historical inconsistency in scientific estimates of sun's distance. Header reads 'The EXACT SCIENCE!' with subtitle 'Sun's distance from Earth-' followed by chronological list of astronomers' estimates in large red text: Copernicus 3 million miles, Tycho Brahe 13 million miles, Kepler 13 million miles, Newton 28 million miles, Newton (2nd attempt) 54 million miles, Martin 1754 81/82 million miles, Encke 1869 95.274.000 million miles, Mleyer 104 million miles, R.Ball 92/93 million miles. Bottom text emphasizes 'only 100 million miles difference!' with underlining. Argues that dramatic variations in historical measurements (ranging from 3 to 104 million miles) demonstrate fundamental inconsistency in scientific method and casts doubt on current accepted value of 93 million miles. Presents evolving scientific understanding as evidence of unreliability rather than refinement of measurement techniques"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-13","title":"The Sun 13","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/233789240_1074832972921624_9209938198059262599_n.jpeg","description":"Four-panel collage comparing sun's appearance at different times with noble gas discharge spectra. Top left: golden sunrise/sunset over green rolling field with dramatic light rays. Top right: bright white sun in blue sky with puffy white clouds. Center panel: Five noble gas discharge tubes showing emission spectra - He (helium - red/pink glow), Ne (neon - red/orange glow), Ar (argon - purple glow), Kr (krypton - blue/white glow), Xe (xenon - white/purple glow) with chemical symbols labeled above each tube. Bottom left: orange/red sunset over water with dark pier or jetty silhouette. Bottom right: dramatic sunset with vibrant purple and orange clouds. Appears to suggest sun's varying colors throughout day (golden sunrise, white midday, orange/red/purple sunset) could be explained by different gas compositions or local light source rather than atmospheric scattering of distant sunlight. Compares sun's color variations to noble gas discharge tubes to imply similarity in mechanism"}}],null,"$L3"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
