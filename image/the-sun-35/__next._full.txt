13:T551,Educational meme about inverse-square law titled 'INVERSE-SQUARE LAW' with yellow borders. Top left explains: 'As light radiates from a point source, the intensity of light (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) from the source. I ~ (1/r²)' followed by 'As intensity is the power per unit area (W/m²), it naturally decreases with the square of the distance as the size of the radiative spherical wavefront increases with distance.' Includes diagram showing light rays spreading from point source through expanding grid frames illustrating inverse-square relationship. Top right shows photograph of person with flashlight in dark forest, beam creating bright cone of light with intensity decreasing with distance. Bottom row shows four sunset photographs labeled 'THE SUN', 'IS NOT', '93 MILLION', 'MILES AWAY' featuring dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through clouds in various configurations. Bottom left shows day/night side-by-side comparison. Large bottom section shows row of light bulbs at increasing distances (6in/15cm through 48in/122cm) demonstrating light intensity falloff. Bottom text 'ALL LIGHT HAS RANGE'. Argues visible light intensity falloff in flashlight and sunset rays proves sun must be local/nearby rather than 93 million miles away, applying inverse-square law to challenge astronomical distances14:T451,Three-part comparison meme contrasting heliocentric CGI with flat Earth sun model. Top section shows CGI planetary size comparison with text 'This CGI image destroys the Heliocentric model of a massive Sun 93 million miles away'. Large yellow sun sphere shown with Jupiter, Saturn, and smaller planets in row below with downward arrow. Blue text on sun reads 'IF THE SUN WERE ACTUALLY THIS MASSIVE AND ITS LIGHT COMING FROM THAT FAR AWAY, A SIMPLE 23° TILT OF EARTH WOULD BE INSIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THIS SCALE, AND THERE WOULD NOT EVEN BE THE SLIGHTEST TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION AROUND THIS TINY SPEC OF A PEBBLE YOU CALL EARTH'. Middle section labeled 'This is a REAL photo of the small local Sun above the Flat Earth' shows bright star-like point source with lens flare/rays against dark blue background. Bottom shows text 'Sun Hotspot' in red with arrow pointing to bright spot on flat blue surface with gradient. Caption 'Demonstrating how we have seasons and temperat fluctuation across Earth'.

Shows black and white illustration of man in business attire looking contemplative with hand on chin. Large yellow sun with radiating rays shown on left side. Speech bubble asks 'What if the Sun actually moves across the sky exactly as it appears to do?' Humorous commentary on questioning heliocentric model by taking sun's apparent motion at face value. Suggests person beginning to question mainstream cosmology by observing sun's obvious east-to-west movement across sky and considering possibility that visual observation (sun moving) is accurate rather than learned explanation (Earth rotating while sun remains stationary). Presents geocentric/flat Earth perspective as common-sense observation versus counter-intuitive heliocentric teaching.
