5:T551,Educational meme about inverse-square law titled 'INVERSE-SQUARE LAW' with yellow borders. Top left explains: 'As light radiates from a point source, the intensity of light (I) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) from the source. I ~ (1/r²)' followed by 'As intensity is the power per unit area (W/m²), it naturally decreases with the square of the distance as the size of the radiative spherical wavefront increases with distance.' Includes diagram showing light rays spreading from point source through expanding grid frames illustrating inverse-square relationship. Top right shows photograph of person with flashlight in dark forest, beam creating bright cone of light with intensity decreasing with distance. Bottom row shows four sunset photographs labeled 'THE SUN', 'IS NOT', '93 MILLION', 'MILES AWAY' featuring dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through clouds in various configurations. Bottom left shows day/night side-by-side comparison. Large bottom section shows row of light bulbs at increasing distances (6in/15cm through 48in/122cm) demonstrating light intensity falloff. Bottom text 'ALL LIGHT HAS RANGE'. Argues visible light intensity falloff in flashlight and sunset rays proves sun must be local/nearby rather than 93 million miles away, applying inverse-square law to challenge astronomical distances0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Sun 35 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Educational meme about inverse-square law titled 'INVERSE-SQUARE LAW' with yellow borders.
