3:T44e,Five-panel collage demonstrating water's level surface at multiple scales. Header text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with subtext 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTHS SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND'. Top panel shows stunning infinity pool overlooking turquoise ocean with tropical island and palm trees in distance, person relaxing in pool. Middle row shows three panels: left - glass with ice and beverage with visible level surface labeled 'FLAT', center - luxury infinity pool with ocean view and wooden deck labeled 'FLAT', right - aerial view of boat on turquoise water labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows large red banner stating 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. All water examples demonstrate perfectly horizontal level surfaces regardless of container size or location. Argues that observable property of water maintaining level surface in all containers (glass, pool, ocean) combined with Earth being 71% water proves planet must be flat plane. Uses progression from small scale (drinking glass) to large scale (ocean) to demonstrate consistency of water's levelness, concluding this proves Earth cannot be curved sphere4:T43b,Two-panel educational diagram about ocean curvature and topography. Top panel labeled 'Aeolus' shows ship on flat water surface with vertical mast and antenna. Red line labeled 'Aeolus Line of Sight' extends diagonally from kite/balloon in upper right down to ship. Gray line labeled 'Ship Line of Sight' extends horizontally from ship across water. Light blue represents flat ocean surface with white clouds above. Demonstrates sight-line geometry argument. Bottom panel labeled 'Ocean Surface' shows cross-section of ocean floor topography with layers: light blue water at top with label 'Ocean Su-', dark blue deeper water labeled 'Continental Shelf' on left and 'Ocean Ridge' in center, brown/tan seafloor showing 'Abyssal Plain', 'Rift Valley', 'Seamount', and 'Trench' features with depth markers '10,000 ft.+' and '35,810 ft'. Text 'Curvature of the Earth' appears in bottom right. Diagram contrasts flat water surface assumption (top) with complex seafloor topography and supposed Earth curvature (bottom), questioning why water surface appears flat if Earth is curved sphere5:T4e0,Screenshot of Wikipedia article on 'Fluid statics' with key passage highlighted. Header shows 'Fluid statics' with 'Main article: Fluid statics' link below. Article text reads: 'Fluid statics or hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies fluids at rest. It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium; and is contrasted with fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why atmospheric pressure changes with altitude, why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red underlines emphasize final phrase 'the surface of water is always level and horizontal whatever the shape of its container.' Red boxes also highlight 'Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics'. Uses mainstream scientific source (Wikipedia article on fluid statics/hydrostatics) to support flat Earth argument by citing established physics principle that water surface is always level and horizontal regardless of container shape. Argues this accepted scientific fact contradicts spherical Earth model where water must conform to curved surface0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"water-level-19","title":"Water Level 19","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/50654736_174771240171720_3295504646461718528_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"water-level-18","title":"Water Level 18","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/40960977_2090828631169809_5626676125791944704_n.jpeg","description":"$4"},"nextImage":{"id":"water-level-20","title":"Water Level 20","category":"water-level","categoryDisplay":"Water Level","src":"/images/gallery/water-level/53403647_3121354081223608_5848837827483140096_n.jpeg","description":"$5"}}],null,"$L6"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
