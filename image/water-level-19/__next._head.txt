5:T44e,Five-panel collage demonstrating water's level surface at multiple scales. Header text 'WATER IS ALWAYS LEVEL' with subtext 'ABOUT 71% OF THE EARTHS SURFACE IS WATER AND 29% IS LAND'. Top panel shows stunning infinity pool overlooking turquoise ocean with tropical island and palm trees in distance, person relaxing in pool. Middle row shows three panels: left - glass with ice and beverage with visible level surface labeled 'FLAT', center - luxury infinity pool with ocean view and wooden deck labeled 'FLAT', right - aerial view of boat on turquoise water labeled 'FLAT'. Bottom section shows large red banner stating 'THE EARTH IS FLAT'. All water examples demonstrate perfectly horizontal level surfaces regardless of container size or location. Argues that observable property of water maintaining level surface in all containers (glass, pool, ocean) combined with Earth being 71% water proves planet must be flat plane. Uses progression from small scale (drinking glass) to large scale (ocean) to demonstrate consistency of water's levelness, concluding this proves Earth cannot be curved sphere0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"Water Level 19 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Five-panel collage demonstrating water's level surface at multiple scales.
