5:T401,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Earth's orbital motion. Top panel shows person driving Toyota car from interior view with hands on steering wheel, blurred motion through windshield, dashboard visible. White text reads 'WHEN A CAR SHIFTS IN ACCELERATION YOU FEEL IT'. Bottom panel shows diagram of Earth's elliptical orbit around sun with cyan/blue background. Shows sun (yellow circle) at center with Earth at two positions: 'Aphelion July 4' at 152,500,000 km (94,500,000 mi) on left, and 'Perihelion January 3' at 147,500,000 km (91,500,000 mi) on right. White text asks 'WHY DONT YOU FEEL IT WHEN THE EARTH SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN???' Argues that if Earth accelerates and decelerates during elliptical orbit (moving faster at perihelion, slower at aphelion per Kepler's laws), humans should feel this acceleration like in car. Ignores that orbital changes are extremely gradual over months with negligible acceleration compared to human perception threshold, and that we're in Earth's reference frame moving with it0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","h",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"children":[["$","meta","0",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"hidden":true,"children":["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.Metadata","children":[["$","title","0",{"children":"The Sun 24 | ZZZ Daily Images"}],["$","meta","1",{"name":"description","content":"Two-panel comparison meme questioning Earth's orbital motion.
