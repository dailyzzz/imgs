3:T401,Two-panel comparison meme questioning Earth's orbital motion. Top panel shows person driving Toyota car from interior view with hands on steering wheel, blurred motion through windshield, dashboard visible. White text reads 'WHEN A CAR SHIFTS IN ACCELERATION YOU FEEL IT'. Bottom panel shows diagram of Earth's elliptical orbit around sun with cyan/blue background. Shows sun (yellow circle) at center with Earth at two positions: 'Aphelion July 4' at 152,500,000 km (94,500,000 mi) on left, and 'Perihelion January 3' at 147,500,000 km (91,500,000 mi) on right. White text asks 'WHY DONT YOU FEEL IT WHEN THE EARTH SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN???' Argues that if Earth accelerates and decelerates during elliptical orbit (moving faster at perihelion, slower at aphelion per Kepler's laws), humans should feel this acceleration like in car. Ignores that orbital changes are extremely gradual over months with negligible acceleration compared to human perception threshold, and that we're in Earth's reference frame moving with it0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"the-sun-24","title":"The Sun 24","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/34014529_1675055982531498_937858752495747072_o.jpeg","description":"$3"},"prevImage":{"id":"the-sun-23","title":"The Sun 23","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/30688896_1654674597914841_8775100974411808768_n.jpeg","description":"Spectacular sunset photograph over ocean beach showing dramatic crepuscular rays (sun rays) bursting through cloud gap. Bright yellow-orange sun sits just above horizon partially obscured by dark gray cloud bank, with multiple distinct light beams radiating upward through clear blue sky above clouds in fan pattern. Golden sunset light illuminates lower clouds and ocean surface. Beach with sandy shore and small waves visible in foreground. Sky shows beautiful gradient from deep blue at top through lighter blue to golden orange near horizon. Milky Way galaxy faintly visible in upper center of darkening sky. Classic example of anticrepuscular and crepuscular rays where parallel sunlight creates appearance of diverging beams due to perspective, demonstrating same optical principle as converging railroad tracks. Stunning natural display of atmospheric optics during twilight"},"nextImage":{"id":"the-sun-25","title":"The Sun 25","category":"the-sun","categoryDisplay":"The Sun","src":"/images/gallery/the-sun/35650134_10156713387165288_4790563881523085312_n.jpeg","description":"Multi-panel image combining sunset photography with sun path diagram. Top four panels show sequence of sunset photographs over ocean from same location, with sun appearing at different positions creating hazy halo effects, coastal vegetation and water visible. Images labeled 'LP' in bottom right of photo grid. Bottom panel shows technical diagram on transparent grid background illustrating sun's apparent path across celestial sphere. Diagram labeled with astronomical terms including 'Vert' (vertical/zenith), 'Antheliv', 'Lowitz arc', '46° halo', 'Parenthely', 'Parhely circle', 'Parhely', 'Obs' (observer), 'Sun', '22° halo'. Shows various optical phenomena and geometric relationships for sun halos and atmospheric optics. Demonstrates how sun's position changes throughout day and various atmospheric optical effects (parhelia/sun dogs, halos, arcs) that can occur. Appears to document actual sun halo observation with corresponding geometric explanation of atmospheric ice crystal refraction phenomena"}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
