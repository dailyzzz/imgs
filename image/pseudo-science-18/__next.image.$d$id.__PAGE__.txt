3:T489,Mobile phone screenshot showing 'SCIENCE vs PSEUDOSCIENCE' comparison chart with black background. Title in white 'SCIENCE' and cyan 'PSEUDOSCIENCE'. Left column 'SCIENCE' lists in white text: 'Follows the evidence wherever it leads', 'Embraces criticism', 'Uses precise terminology with clear definitions', 'Claims are conservative and tentative', 'Properly considers all evidence and arguments', 'Uses rigorous and repeatable methods', 'Engages with peers and community', 'Follows careful and valid logic', 'Changes with new evidence'. Right column 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' lists in cyan: 'Starts with a conclusion, then works backwards to confirm', 'Hostile to criticism', 'Uses vague jargon to confuse and evade', 'Grandiose claims that go beyond the evidence', 'Cherry picks only favorable evidence, relies on testimonials or weak evidence', 'Uses flawed methods with unrepeatable results', 'Lone mavericks working in isolation', 'Uses inconsistent and invalid logic', 'Dogmatic and unyielding'. Bottom shows 'SoyceCrashCourse' logo. Status bar shows 70% battery, 11:28 time.

Top section titled 'SCIENCE' (green text) shows flat plane diagram with blue water in beakers at different levels, demonstrating water seeking level (observable, repeatable, measurable) with green checkmarks. Right shows gray sphere/globe with water level marked. Pink watermark 'fb.com/aterraeplana'. Bottom section titled 'PSEUDOSCIENCE' (red text) shows blue outlined sphere with radiating blue rectangles (representing satellites or observation points) around globe. Right side lists red X marks for 'Observable', 'Repeatable', 'Measureable'. Argues flat plane with level water is scientific (can be observed, repeated, measured) while spherical Earth with curved water surface is pseudoscience (cannot be demonstrated experimentally). Presents water finding level as proof Earth is flat, claiming globe model fails basic scientific method criteria."},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-19","title":"Pseudo Science 19","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/28056294_10159931981790403_1106138291938487496_n.jpeg","description":"Meme with CGI rendered Earth showing day/night terminator, city lights on dark side, blue oceans, green/brown continents, white clouds, sun rays on left side, black space with stars.

UPSIDE DOWN AND STICKS TO THE SPINNING BALL' Bottom text: 'IM CALLING BULLSHIT!!' Satirical critique listing perceived impossibilities of globe Earth model: people living upside down in Southern Hemisphere, water curving around sphere, rivers flowing uphill (against gravity on curved surface), water adhering to spinning planet. Uses sarcasm to reject globe model physics, questioning how gravity keeps water and people attached to spinning spherical Earth, implying these phenomena are absurd and therefore globe Earth is false."}}],null,"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
