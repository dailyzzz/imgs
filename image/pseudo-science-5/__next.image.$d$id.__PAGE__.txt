3:T41a,Statistical probability comparison meme with playing cards image. Hand holding playing cards showing royal flush (Ace through 10 of hearts) against green card table background. Three probability statements in white text: 'The probability of getting FIVE royal flushes in a row is 0.000000000000000000000000668157876' with exponent notation '14352475950670290899384801%. If that happened, you would reasonably conclude that the game is somehow rigged.' Second: 'The probability of functional sequence of amino acids in several known proteins arising from chance is 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%, or 1 in 10^63.' Third: 'The probability of a functional simple cell to arise without intelligent design, given all the ingredients is 1 in 10^57600!' Uses extremely low probability comparisons to argue biological complexity requires intelligent design, claiming random chance cannot explain protein formation or cellular origin, comparing it to impossibly unlikely card game scenarios that would indicate rigging.0:{"buildId":"HwirP9wPNHV_gOqk-z8Xo","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"image":{"id":"pseudo-science-5","title":"Pseudo Science 5","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/18194629_809120345907850_3756422759914770187_n.jpeg","description":"Three-panel satirical meme about gender identity and science.

Bottom text: 'Come on people!!! You HAVE to call Bullshit at some point!' Uses absurdist comparison: if someone can identify as different gender, by same logic rusted old car could identify as luxury Lamborghini. Satirical critique of gender identity concepts by comparing to obviously false material claim, arguing there must be objective limits to self-identification that contradict physical reality."},"prevImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-4","title":"Pseudo Science 4","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/17308747_10212770846294202_4612703730941144270_n.jpeg","description":"$3"},"nextImage":{"id":"pseudo-science-6","title":"Pseudo Science 6","category":"pseudo-science","categoryDisplay":"Pseudo-Science","src":"/images/gallery/pseudo-science/18920195_1575681575788762_1420067453065359_n.jpeg","description":"Nighttime photograph of Great Pyramid of Giza illuminated orange-red with dramatic lighting against dark sky, with text overlay suggesting numerological coincidence.

Claims pyramid's latitude coordinate (29.9792458°N) matches first 8 digits of speed of light in meters per second (299,792,458), suggesting ancient Egyptians encoded advanced physics knowledge or universal constants into pyramid's location.
