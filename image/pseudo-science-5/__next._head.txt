Bottom panel shows rusted deteriorated vintage car (appears to be 1970s sedan) with wood paneling missing, rust, damage, on brick patio, with speech bubble 'And I'M a Lamborghini!' Bottom text: 'Come on people!!! You HAVE to call Bullshit at some point!' Uses absurdist comparison: if someone can identify as different gender, by same logic rusted old car could identify as luxury Lamborghini. Satirical critique of gender identity concepts by comparing to obviously false material claim, arguing there must be objective limits to self-identification that contradict physical reality."}],["$","meta","15",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["$","meta","16",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["$","meta","17",{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Pseudo Science 5"}],["$","meta","18",{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Three-panel satirical meme about gender identity and science.
