Panel 3: 'Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet.'

Top photo shows large multi-story rectangular building (possibly Beau Rivage or similar Gulf Coast resort) with uniform grid of windows extending horizontally across frame, appearing perfectly vertical with no lean or tilt, photographed from water with slight atmospheric haze creating layered appearance. Large yellow text overlaid: 'No tilt means NO CURVE'. Bottom section shows technical diagram with white background illustrating sight line geometry from observer position (h0) to building labeled as 'Target' across distance (d1) with green arc representing Earth curvature and 'Horizon' marked.

Argues that if Earth were curved, distant buildings photographed across water should appear tilted away from observer due to surface curvature, while straight vertical appearance allegedly proves flat plane"},"nextImage":{"id":"other-16","title":"Other 16","category":"other","categoryDisplay":"Other","src":"/images/gallery/other/image-1.jpeg","description":"Comparison meme questioning NASA Earth and Moon photograph authenticity.
